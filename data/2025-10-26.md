### [1] [A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles and the MaxCut Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19835)
*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum-inspired algorithm using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) for solving QUBO problems, achieving results on Sudoku and MaxCut instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a scalable and effective solution for QUBO problems, equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians.

Method: The algorithm utilizes Matrix Product States (MPS) to represent spin configurations compactly, employs a transverse magnetic field as part of a driver Hamiltonian, and uses DMRG for energy minimization through iterative sweeps.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on Sudoku puzzles (200+ spins) and MaxCut problems (up to 251 nodes with 3,265 edges), identifying global minima consistently.

Conclusion: The quantum-inspired approach is scalable, generalizable, and suitable for industrial-scale QUBO problems, offering reliable global optimization.

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

### [2] [Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19836)
*Eliseo Curcio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB) to evaluate the reasoning reliability of large language models in energy systems analysis, incorporating multiple metrics such as accuracy and transparency. Results show that models like GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet performed best in reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no standardized framework to assess whether AI systems reason correctly, especially in the energy sector. Existing validation focuses mainly on predictive accuracy or efficiency, overlooking logical integrity.

Method: The paper presents the ARB, a framework that evaluates reasoning reliability through five metrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency. Tested using open technoeconomic datasets, four large language models were benchmarked.

Result: The evaluation showed varying results: GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved high reasoning reliability, Gemini 2.5 Pro displayed moderate performance, while Llama 3 70B fell below expected thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed these discrepancies.

Conclusion: The ARB is the first quantitative framework in energy studies for assessing AI systems' reasoning reliability. It ensures trustworthy, policy-compliant, and transparent assessments, aiding global energy transition efforts.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

### [3] [Branch-and-Browse: Efficient and Controllable Web Exploration with Tree-Structured Reasoning and Action Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19838)
*Shiqi He,Yue Cui,Xinyu Ma,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Mosharaf Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse is a fine-grained framework that improves reasoning depth and efficiency for LLM-based web agents, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous web agent methods struggle with poor reasoning depth, lack of effective backtracking, and inefficient computational strategies.

Method: The authors propose a framework combining structured reasoning-acting, tree-structured exploration, web state replay for efficient exploration, and a shared page action memory.

Result: The framework achieved a task success rate of 35.8% and reduced execution time by up to 40.4% on the WebArena benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse offers a significant advancement in the reliability and efficiency of LLM-based autonomous web agents for goal-oriented tasks in open web environments.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

### [4] [DAG-Math: Graph-Guided Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19842)
*Yuanhe Zhang,Ilja Kuzborskij,Jason D. Lee,Chenlei Leng,Fanghui Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by measuring how well their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions adhere to structured reasoning within directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although LLMs perform well on mathematical problems using CoT reasoning, it is unclear whether their performance is due to genuine reasoning, memorization, or other processes. There is a need to evaluate the rule-based reasoning capacity of LLM-generated solutions.

Method: The authors propose modeling CoT reasoning as a rule-based stochastic process on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and measure how closely LLM outputs adhere to rule-consistent derivation using a metric called logical closeness. They introduced the DAG-MATH CoT format and a benchmark to evaluate reasoning fidelity in LLMs.

Result: The study found statistically significant differences in reasoning fidelity among various families of LLMs, even in cases where traditional performance metrics (e.g., PASS@k) were comparable. This highlights discrepancies between final-answer accuracy and actual rule-consistent reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap between unrestricted CoT methods and formal proof systems, enabling better diagnostics for evaluating LLM reasoning capabilities. The developed benchmark and code provide actionable tools for future research in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

*Mathieu Andreux,Märt Bakler,Yanael Barbier,Hamza Ben Chekroun,Emilien Biré,Antoine Bonnet,Riaz Bordie,Nathan Bout,Matthias Brunel,Aleix Cambray,Pierre-Louis Cedoz,Antoine Chassang,Gautier Cloix,Ethan Connelly,Alexandra Constantinou,Ramzi De Coster,Hubert de la Jonquiere,Aurélien Delfosse,Maxime Delpit,Alexis Deprez,Augustin Derupti,Mathieu Diaz,Shannon D'Souza,Julie Dujardin,Abai Edmund,Michael Eickenberg,Armand Fatalot,Wissem Felissi,Isaac Herring,Xavier Koegler,Erwan Le Jumeau de Kergaradec,Aurélien Lac,Maxime Langevin,Corentin Lauverjat,Antonio Loison,Avshalom Manevich,Axel Moyal,Axel Nguyen Kerbel,Marinela Parovic,Julien Revelle,Guillaume Richard,Mats Richter,Ronan Riochet,María Santos,Romain Savidan,Laurent Sifre,Maxime Theillard,Marc Thibault,Ivan Valentini,Tony Wu,Laura Yie,Kai Yuan,Jevgenij Zubovskij*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Surfer 2 is a unified architecture operating purely on visual observations to outperform previous systems on web, desktop, and mobile environments without environment-specific interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a generalized agent that works seamlessly across web, desktop, and mobile platforms, challenging the limitations of prior systems that use environment-specific interfaces.

Method: Surfer 2 integrates hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, self-verification with adaptive recovery, and purely visual observations to achieve efficient cross-platform functionality.

Result: Surfer 2 achieved high accuracy scores: 97.1% on WebVoyager, 69.6% on WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming prior systems and human benchmarks without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Surfer 2 showcases how systematic orchestration can amplify foundation model capabilities for general-purpose computer control, while emphasizing the need for next-generation vision language models for optimal efficiency.

Abstract: Building agents that generalize across web, desktop, and mobile environments
remains an open challenge, as prior systems rely on environment-specific
interfaces that limit cross-platform deployment. We introduce Surfer 2, a
unified architecture operating purely from visual observations that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all three environments. Surfer 2 integrates
hierarchical context management, decoupled planning and execution, and
self-verification with adaptive recovery, enabling reliable operation over long
task horizons. Our system achieves 97.1% accuracy on WebVoyager, 69.6% on
WebArena, 60.1% on OSWorld, and 87.1% on AndroidWorld, outperforming all prior
systems without task-specific fine-tuning. With multiple attempts, Surfer 2
exceeds human performance on all benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
systematic orchestration amplifies foundation model capabilities and enables
general-purpose computer control through visual interaction alone, while
calling for a next-generation vision language model to achieve Pareto-optimal
cost-efficiency.

### [6] [RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954)
*Joseph Meyer,Divyansha Lachi,Reza Mohammadi,Roshan Reddy Upendra,Eva L. Dyer,Mark Li,Tom Palczewski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RELATE, a schema-agnostic feature encoder for heterogeneous temporal graphs aimed at improving scalability by sharing parameters across node attributes and enabling multi-dataset pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural networks (GNNs) face limitations due to schema-specific encoders, which hinder scalability and parameter sharing, especially when applied to relational multi-table data.

Method: RELATE uses modality-specific encoders for various attribute types, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention mechanism to aggregate features into fixed-size node representations. It seamlessly integrates with existing general-purpose GNNs.

Result: RELATE performs nearly on par (within 3% of accuracy) with schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x in the RelBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The RELATE encoder provides significant advancements in flexibility and efficiency for relational graph data, supporting varying schemas and enabling multi-dataset pretraining, moving closer to foundation models for GNNs.

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [7] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the emerging issue of generative AI enhancing vehicle insurance fraud and proposes a novel solution, UVeye layered technology, to combat it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing misuse of generative AI technologies, such as deepfakes, that facilitate large-scale and efficient insurance fraud, causing significant financial losses.

Method: The paper introduces UVeye layered solution as a method to detect, mitigate, and prevent generative AI-enabled fraud in the vehicle insurance sector.

Result: This solution promises to be a significant improvement in tackling AI-driven insurance scams, overcoming some shortcomings of existing detection methods.

Conclusion: While generative AI continues to pose challenges to insurers, UVeye’s approach offers a promising advancement to address and counter vehicle insurance fraud effectively.

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

### [8] [AI-Driven Personalized Learning: Predicting Academic Per-formance Through Leadership Personality Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19964)
*Nitsa J Herzog,Rejwan Bin Sulaiman,David J Herzog,Rose Fong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines AI technologies in personalizing learning, focusing on predicting student success using leadership personality traits and machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance personalized learning by identifying academic success potential through leadership traits and machine learning modeling.

Method: Data from 129 master's students were analyzed, involving leadership personality tests, self-assessments, and academic grades. Feature selection used Pearson correlation coefficients, and ML models (e.g., RF) were tuned to predict academic categories (fail, pass, excellent).

Result: The Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 87.50% by combining leadership traits and marks, and 85.71% without the marks.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging leadership personality traits and ML for improving personalized learning by tailoring educational approaches to student needs.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

### [9] [LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length.ipynb](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075)
*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a protocol that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to covertly hide one text within another coherent text of the same length, raising trust and AI safety concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how LLMs can be used to embed meaningful content secretly within a different coherent text, highlighting potential risks and implications.

Method: The study employs an efficient protocol using 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs to encode and decode hidden messages in texts quickly on local systems.

Result: The protocol successfully demonstrates the ability to conceal and extract hidden messages in texts, showcasing high-quality results even with moderately sized LLMs.

Conclusion: This discovery poses significant challenges to text authenticity and AI safety, as it undermines trust in written communication and raises ethical concerns about LLM deployment.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

### [10] [AI PB: A Grounded Generative Agent for Personalized Investment Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20099)
*Daewoo Park,Suho Park,Inseok Hong,Hanwool Lee,Junkyu Park,Sangjun Lee,Jeongman An,Hyunbin Loh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI PB, a generative AI designed to provide personalized and compliant financial insights for retail finance, differentiating itself by being proactive rather than merely reactive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to develop a generative AI system that offers personalized, compliant, and proactive financial insights to simplify complex retail financial services and adhere to Korean regulatory standards.

Method: The methodology involves building a production-scale generative agent with components like a deterministic orchestration layer for data-sensitive routing, a hybrid retrieval pipeline with OpenSearch and domain-specific embeddings, and a multi-stage recommendation mechanism that integrates rule heuristics, behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits. It is deployed fully on-premise using Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 NVIDIA H100 GPUs.

Result: The system's effectiveness is validated through human QA and system metrics, showing that it can generate grounded, trustworthy financial insights while ensuring data sensitivity and compliance.

Conclusion: AI PB demonstrates that a carefully designed generative AI system with explicit routing, hybrid retrieval, and layered safety mechanisms can succeed in delivering reliable and regulated insights in high-stakes domains like retail finance.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

### [11] [Human-Centered LLM-Agent System for Detecting Anomalous Digital Asset Transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20102)
*Gyuyeon Na,Minjung Park,Hyeonjeong Cha,Sangmi Chai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA is a system enabling non-experts to detect and analyze anomalies in digital asset transactions using a human-centered, interactive workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve anomaly detection in digital asset transactions by creating a system that is interpretable and accessible for non-experts.

Method: HCLA integrates parsing, detection using XGBoost, and explanation into a conversational workflow, allowing natural language interaction and structured analytics.

Result: Using a labeled Bitcoin dataset, the system demonstrated strong detector accuracy and introduced interpretability and interactive refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed human-in-the-loop design enhances transparency and trust in anomaly detection for financial forensics.

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [12] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques the use of generative AI in legal practice, highlighting its limitations in transparency and reliability, and introduces the verification-value paradox, suggesting that AI's efficiency gains are counterbalanced by the need for manual verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the increasing adoption of generative AI in legal practice, coupled with the risks and ethical concerns surrounding its use, such as the submission of inaccurate AI-generated content by lawyers.

Method: The paper introduces a conceptual model (the verification-value paradox) to evaluate the limitations and implications of AI use in legal practice.

Result: The study highlights how efficiency gains from AI in legal practice may often be offset by the necessity for manual verification, making AI's overall benefit negligible.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that legal practice requires a paradigm shift to address the limitations of AI use, emphasizing values like fidelity to truth and civic responsibility in legal practice and education.

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

### [13] [TRUST: A Decentralized Framework for Auditing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20188)
*Morris Yu-Chao Huang,Zhen Tan,Mohan Zhang,Pingzhi Li,Zhuo Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces TRUST, a decentralized framework for auditing LLMs by verifying reasoning chains, with mechanisms for robustness, scalability, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized auditing methods for LLMs are prone to bias, opacity, and scalability issues, risking trust and safety in high-stakes operations.

Method: TRUST employs a decentralized mechanism, using consensus among diverse auditors, hierarchical reasoning decomposition, blockchain for accountability, and privacy-preserving techniques.

Result: The TRUST framework demonstrated effectiveness in detecting flaws and maintaining robustness in LLM reasoning across diverse tasks and models in experiments.

Conclusion: TRUST sets a foundation for decentralized AI auditing, addressing critical challenges such as robustness, scalability, transparency, and privacy for safer LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [14] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the transition of large language models (LLMs) from flexible, open systems to stable, consolidated ones with fixed goal structures, which is crucial for achieving AGI but raises safety concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs evolve toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), examining their potential shift from open imitation to a consolidated identity with stable and reliable behaviors.

Method: The authors formalize the concept of identity consolidation in LLMs, study its relation to learning dynamics, define operational metrics for detection, and conduct experiments on models of different scales to observe outcomes of consolidation.

Result: Experimental results show that identity consolidation in LLMs varies by model scale, resulting in trade-offs in smaller models, cost-free stability in mid-sized models, and transient instabilities in larger quantized models.

Conclusion: Identity consolidation is a key step toward AGI reliability but comes with risks like hardening of unpredictable behaviors. The process serves as both a safety challenge and a control possibility through deliberate design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The research examines evolutionary training methods to optimize AI for solving the game 2048, comparing two approaches: a two-agent metaprompting system and a single-agent refinement system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the challenge of optimizing AI in dynamic environments through the strategic and stochastic context of the game 2048.

Method: Two systems were implemented: a two-agent metaprompting system with a thinker and executor model, and a single-agent system using Monte Carlo Tree Search with evolutionary refinement techniques.

Result: The single-agent approach demonstrated substantial improvement with a 473.2 average point increase per cycle, while the two-agent metaprompting system showed limited success.

Conclusion: Evolutionary refinement techniques hold promise for improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments, though metaprompting limitations were evident.

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

*Tianyi Zhang,Xiaolin Zhou,Yunzhe Wang,Erik Cambria,David Traum,Rui Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in their capacity for individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) by introducing a novel task, evaluating cognitive methods, and enhancing authorial style emulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capability of large language models (LLMs) in capturing deeper, individualized cognitive processes rather than just surface-level behavior.

Method: They introduced a new task for ICS, created a dataset from novels published after the tested LLMs, and evaluated various cognitive representation methods using an 11-condition framework on seven LLMs to benchmark their performance in emulating authorial style.

Result: Combining conceptual and linguistic features excels in individualized cognitive simulation (ICS), surpassing static profile-based methods. However, LLMs showed better emulation of linguistic style and struggled with narrative structure.

Conclusion: The study's findings emphasize the limits of LLMs in simulating deeper individualized cognition but lay the groundwork for developing AI systems capable of personalized and human-aligned creativity.

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

### [17] [Using Large Language Models for Abstraction of Planning Domains - Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20258)
*Bita Banihashemi,Megh Patel,Yves Lespérance*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating abstract PDDL domains and problem instances to aid planning and reasoning, validated by tools and experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating domain abstractions that assist in effective planning, reasoning, and explanation for dynamic tasks.

Method: The authors use in-context learning with LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, to generate abstract PDDL domains based on natural language abstraction objectives, and validate outputs using symbolic tools and human experts.

Result: Experiments reveal that GPT-4o can effectively generate useful domain abstractions, particularly for actions, while showing limitations with fluents.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o hold promise for synthesizing planning domain abstractions, although there is room for improvement regarding abstraction of fluents.

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

*Yunzhi Liu,Haokai Tan,Rushi Kanjaria,Lihuan Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT) model integrates temporal descriptors and POI embeddings to enhance human mobility forecasting, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for more accurate human mobility forecasts for applications such as disaster relief, city planning, and public health. Current models fail to fully utilize POI and temporal information in representing the semantic contexts of human movement.

Method: The proposed STaBERT model enriches a BERT-based mobility model by incorporating POI embeddings and derived temporal descriptors, creating a semantically enriched representation of human mobility.

Result: STaBERT demonstrated significant improvement in mobility prediction accuracy: GEO-BLEU scores increased from 0.34 to 0.75 for single-city predictions and from 0.34 to 0.56 for multi-city predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal and POI information improves the semantic representation of mobility patterns, enhancing prediction accuracy in human mobility forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

*Mingliang Zhai,Hansheng Liang,Xiaomeng Fan,Zhi Gao,Chuanhao Li,Che Sun,Xu Bin,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolEQA integrates external tools and multi-step reasoning for embodied question answering (EQA) in 3D environments, significantly improving task efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in EQA are limited by lack of reasoning ability, which leads to inefficient exploration and suboptimal responses. Another limitation is insufficient planning during exploration.

Method: ToolEQA incorporates external tools to enhance reasoning and planning in EQA. A data generation pipeline was developed to produce the EQA-RT dataset with reasoning trajectories. This dataset enables the model to learn better tool usage and multi-step reasoning.

Result: ToolEQA achieved a 9.2~20.2% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines and a 10% improvement over zero-shot ToolEQA performance. It also demonstrated state-of-the-art results on HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.

Conclusion: ToolEQA enhances efficiency and accuracy in embodied question answering tasks by integrating external tools and multi-step reasoning, and performs robustly across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

*Anna Arias-Duart,Maria Eugenia Cardello,Atia Cortés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines the barriers caused by biased training data in the integration of AI into healthcare and presents practical recommendations to mitigate these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limited integration of AI in clinical practice due to data quality and fairness issues arising from biased clinical data collection.

Method: The paper is based on insights from the AI4HealthyAging project, where biases in clinical data collection were detected and analyzed across multiple use cases.

Result: The findings reveal various types of biases such as historical, representation, and measurement biases, with manifestations across demographic and socioeconomic variables.

Conclusion: To improve the fairness and robustness of AI in healthcare, the paper offers practical recommendations for clinical problem design and data collection, contributing to the development of equitable AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel model to assess collateral damage in military operations using AI systems, integrating multiple dimensions within a unified architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure responsible targeting and minimize collateral effects of AI systems in military operations.

Method: The study employs a design science approach to develop a Knowledge Representation and Reasoning architecture that incorporates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions for collateral damage assessment.

Result: The model provides detailed representation and reasoning mechanisms for evaluating collateral damage caused by engaging AI systems, demonstrated through an instantiation.

Conclusion: The proposed model lays the grounds for building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems to assess and mitigate collateral damage in military contexts involving AI systems.

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey examines the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Knowledge Graph (KG) construction, shifting from traditional methodologies to generative, language-driven paradigms. It explores schema-based and schema-free approaches while identifying technical limitations and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how LLMs reshape traditional methodologies for Knowledge Graph construction and to bridge symbolic knowledge engineering with neural semantic understanding.

Method: This paper systematically reviews traditional KG methodologies and contrasts them with emerging LLM-driven approaches, focusing on schema-based and schema-free paradigms, and organizes the findings into representative frameworks. It also suggests future research directions.

Result: The paper synthesizes advancements in KG construction driven by LLMs, identifying the strengths of schema-based and schema-free approaches, while highlighting existing limitations within these paradigms.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that LLMs have significantly influenced KG methodologies, promoting a shift towards adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems, and outlines potential research avenues for advancing the synergy between LLMs and KGs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method called Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow) to enhance large language models for new domains without degrading instruction-following ability, while avoiding reliance on original model weights or external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting large language models to new domains without degrading their instruction-following capabilities, especially in cases where original base model weights or external corpora are unavailable.

Method: The proposed method, IKnow, introduces novel self-supervised objectives in an instruction-response dialogue format that leverage domain knowledge within the text itself, aiming to enhance representation at a deeper semantic level.

Result: IKnow successfully adapts large language models to new domains without the need for external resources or base model weights, while maintaining the models' core capabilities.

Conclusion: IKnow provides a simple and effective solution for continual pretraining of large language models, overcoming limitations posed by lack of access to the base model or external domain-specific knowledge.

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EBR, a neural reasoner using embeddings for concept learning, which is robust against data inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning methods in concept learning struggle with inconsistencies and erroneous data in real-world knowledge bases.

Method: The paper presents the neural reasoner EBR, which utilizes embeddings to approximate results without relying on traditional symbolic reasoning.

Result: Experiments show EBR demonstrates robustness against missing and erroneous data, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: EBR provides a more practical approach to concept learning, leveraging embeddings for reasoning while being resilient to data issues.

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FLORA, an unsupervised method for holistic and interpretable knowledge graph alignment using fuzzy logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for knowledge graph alignment primarily focus on entity-level similarity and lack interpretable reasoning, requiring training data.

Method: FLORA combines unsupervised fuzzy logic-based iterative alignment of both entities and relations without needing training data.

Result: FLORA achieves state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, supports dangling entities, and provides interpretable results.

Conclusion: The proposed method delivers effective, holistic, and explainable alignment for knowledge graphs while being unsupervised and convergent.

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines public feedback incorporation in AI policy in Australia, Colombia, and the U.S. and finds inadequate engagement and responsiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether public input on AI policy is being effectively integrated into governance and to address the trust gap between citizens and policymakers.

Method: The authors conducted a comparative analysis of three countries by assessing their methods of gathering public input and its impact on policy-making.

Result: Citizen involvement in AI governance is minimal, with less than 1% participating, and governments have failed to establish meaningful dialogue or responsiveness.

Conclusion: Current practices fall short in engaging the public on AI policy issues, risking trust and legitimacy in AI governance. The paper proposes eight recommendations to improve inclusivity and responsiveness.

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based method for optimizing network topology to manage congestion in large-scale transmission grids, achieving significant speed improvements and generalization across systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for network topology optimization (NTO) are computationally infeasible for large-scale systems and lack generalization across unseen topologies, varying conditions, and different systems.

Method: The authors introduced a graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach, using heterogeneous edge-aware message passing to predict effective busbar splitting actions for congestion management.

Result: The proposed method provides up to 4 orders-of-magnitude speed-up while maintaining AC feasibility and achieving a 2.3% optimality gap on large systems like the GOC 2000-bus system.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that GNN-based approaches could enable near-real-time NTO for large systems, addressing generalization and efficiency challenges effectively.

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a granular evaluation method for reasoning in LLMs, assessing relevance and coherence via causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE) to improve reasoning quality and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of evaluating LLMs solely based on final-answer correctness, which overlooks reasoning quality and provides limited insight for improving models.

Method: The paper proposes decomposing reasoning quality into relevance and coherence metrics and introduces a causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE) framework that assesses reasoning steps based on their preceding context, avoiding hindsight bias.

Result: The CaSE method is validated against human judgments using expert-annotated benchmarks and is shown to enhance LLM reasoning and final task performance when used for curating training data.

Conclusion: The study presents a scalable evaluation mechanism (CaSE) that focuses on reasoning quality, demonstrating its potential to analyze, debug, and improve LLM reasoning while emphasizing the advantages of moving beyond simple validity checks.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

*Changan Liu,Zixuan Xie,Ahad N. Zehmakan,Zhongzhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces two scalable methods to compute random walk centrality efficiently for large networks, achieving near-linear time complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing random walk centrality is computationally demanding for large graphs, limiting its practical use despite its importance in graph analysis.

Method: Two algorithms are proposed: one using approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, and the other utilizing rooted spanning trees sampling.

Result: The methods improve efficiency, working in near-linear time, and produce accurate approximations on large graphs, tested on datasets with over 10 million nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance the practicality of random walk centrality computation, combining efficiency and accuracy in large-scale real-world applications.

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

*Riccardo Guidotti,Martina Cinquini,Marta Marchiori Manerba,Mattia Setzu,Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MIMOSA framework for creating interpretable predictive models that integrate key ethical properties like causality, fairness, and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop interpretable and trustworthy AI models that balance performance, interpretability, and ethical considerations for real-world applications.

Method: The MIMOSA framework creates interpretable models using feature importance, rule-based, and instance-based approaches. It incorporates ethical properties like causality, fairness, and privacy into the models.

Result: The framework demonstrates how fairness, privacy, and causal reasoning can be integrated into interpretable AI systems, ensuring ethical decision-making.

Conclusion: MIMOSA lays the theoretical groundwork for building AI systems that are accurate, interpretable, ethical, and trustworthy.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

### [32] [Towards Reliable Evaluation of Large Language Models for Multilingual and Multimodal E-Commerce Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20632)
*Shuyi Xie,Ziqin Liew,Hailing Zhang,Haibo Zhang,Ling Hu,Zhiqiang Zhou,Shuman Liu,Anxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcomEval is a new multilingual and multimodal benchmarking tool for assessing large language models (LLMs) in e-commerce scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce evaluation tools lack diversity, multimodality, and multilingual data, making it difficult to assess LLMs on real-world shopping interactions.

Method: EcomEval features six categories and 37 tasks with multimodal inputs derived from real customer queries and transactions, while responses are refined through expert annotators using a semi-automatic pipeline.

Result: EcomEval introduces authentic evaluations across real-world scenarios, defining task difficulties and supporting multiple languages, including low-resource Southeast Asian ones.

Conclusion: EcomEval sets a new standard for comprehensive assessment of LLMs in practical e-commerce applications, addressing previous benchmarks' limitations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

*Eric Ngoiya,Tianshu Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to assess how models adapt to dynamic and scaling environments, focusing on their ability to respond accurately, switch contexts, and maintain continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a metric that evaluates the adaptability of models in situations where environment states continuously change over time, addressing the need for robust response and prediction in real-world applications.

Method: The study develops the Fluidity Index, a benchmark that evaluates models by measuring deviations in environment states (initial, current, and future), emphasizing closed-loop open-ended benchmarks for testing adaptability.

Result: The paper proposes that a truly super-intelligent model should exhibit second-order adaptability to achieve optimal computational fluidity through digital replenishment.

Conclusion: The Fluidity Index provides valuable insights into model adaptability, emphasizing the importance of context-switching and predicting state changes, setting benchmarks for evaluating super-intelligent models.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

*Andrea Agiollo,Andrea Omicini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses integrating machine learning (ML) within rational agent architectures, focusing on the fragmented field and proposing a framework using the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incoherence in the integration of ML into rational agent architectures and enhance their expressive and cognitive capacities.

Method: Analyzed existing literature on rational agents with ML, using the BDI paradigm to systematize approaches and identify challenges.

Result: The analysis showed the fast growth in rational ML agent research, highlighted gaps, and proposed research directions.

Conclusion: Effective integration of ML into rational architectures, like BDI, requires addressing design challenges and exploring opportunities for further advancements.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

### [35] [The Shape of Reasoning: Topological Analysis of Reasoning Traces in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20665)
*Xue Wen Tan,Nathaniel Tan,Galen Lee,Stanley Kok*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new evaluation framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) for assessing the reasoning quality of large language models, achieving better results compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges in reliably and efficiently evaluating the reasoning traces of large language models, overcoming limitations of manual annotation and oversimplified graph-based metrics.

Method: A framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) is proposed to analyze the geometric features of reasoning traces, replacing traditional graph-based proxies with higher-dimensional analysis.

Result: Topological features demonstrated higher predictive power for reasoning quality and identified a stable, compact set of indicators that can enhance reinforcement learning algorithms.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that reasoning quality is better captured by geometric structures over relational graphs, offering a practical and automated tool for reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

*Yanlin Song,Ben Liu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiwei Hu,Qianqian Xie,Min Peng,Sophia Ananiadou,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-RFT combines structured reasoning and adaptive retrieval using reinforcement fine-tuning to improve Knowledge Graph Question Answering under incomplete knowledge conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KGQA methods face challenges with leveraging knowledge graphs, reasoning capabilities, and coping with incomplete KG coverage, often leading to reasoning failures.

Method: Graph-RFT employs a 'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm with chain-of-thought fine-tuning and a novel reinforcement learning process, combining planning, retrieval, and multi-reward optimization.

Result: Graph-RFT enhances reasoning by introducing structured, coherent multi-step planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling, improving question answering even under incomplete KG scenarios.

Conclusion: Graph-RFT offers innovative mechanisms for planning and adaptive retrieval, resolving limitations in existing KGQA approaches and enabling effective reasoning using both knowledge graphs and web sources.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [37] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new metric for assessing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that penalizes imbalances across cognitive domains, contrasting the previous arithmetic mean approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to define and evaluate AGI in a way that balances competence across cognitive domains, integrating "coherent sufficiency" rather than rewarding specialization in certain domains.

Method: The authors propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI using the integral of generalized means over a range of compensability exponents, which creates the area under the curve (AUC) metric.

Result: Applying this measure to GPT-4 and GPT-5 domain scores showed that both systems are far from balanced general competence, despite high arithmetic mean scores.

Conclusion: This coherence-adjusted AUC provides a stricter and interpretable framework for tracking genuine progress towards AGI compared to traditional metrics, highlighting penalties on imbalance and inter-domain dependency.

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using SiMRA in DDR4 DRAM chips to generate true random numbers at high throughput and low latency, with rigorous experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to develop a method for generating true random numbers efficiently and reliably using commercially available DRAM chips.

Method: The researchers leveraged Simultaneous Multiple-Row Activation (SiMRA) and conducted extensive characterization of 96 DDR4 DRAM chips under different conditions such as data patterns, temperature levels, and varying numbers of activated rows.

Result: They demonstrated that SiMRA-based TRNG designs generate random numbers with higher throughput and entropy compared to previous methods, and successfully pass the NIST statistical test suite for randomness.

Conclusion: SiMRA-based TRNG designs improve entropy, latency, and throughput, outperforming existing solutions and paving the way for further research using open-source infrastructure.

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally demonstrate that it is possible to generate
true random numbers at high throughput and low latency in commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips by leveraging simultaneous multiple-row
activation (SiMRA) via an extensive characterization of 96 DDR4 DRAM chips. We
rigorously analyze SiMRA's true random generation potential in terms of
entropy, latency, and throughput for varying numbers of simultaneously
activated DRAM rows (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32), data patterns, temperature
levels, and spatial variations. Among our 11 key experimental observations, we
highlight four key results. First, we evaluate the quality of our TRNG designs
using the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for randomness and find
that all SiMRA-based TRNG designs successfully pass each test. Second, 2-, 8-,
16-, and 32-row activation-based TRNG designs outperform the state-of-theart
DRAM-based TRNG in throughput by up to 1.15x, 1.99x, 1.82x, and 1.39x,
respectively. Third, SiMRA's entropy tends to increase with the number of
simultaneously activated DRAM rows. Fourth, operational parameters and
conditions (e.g., data pattern and temperature) significantly affect entropy.
For example, for most of the tested modules, the average entropy of 32-row
activation is 2.51x higher than that of 2-row activation. For example,
increasing the temperature from 50{\deg}C to 90{\deg}C decreases SiMRA's
entropy by 1.53x for 32-row activation. To aid future research and development,
we open-source our infrastructure at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/SiMRA-TRNG.

*Rubén Langarita,Jesús Alastruey-Benedé,Pablo Ibáñez-Marín,Santiago Marco-Sola,Miquel Moretó,Adrià Armejach*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes Squire, a general-purpose accelerator for dependency-bound kernels, offering improved performance, energy efficiency, and minimal overhead compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address performance and energy limitations in traditional accelerators like SIMD and GPGPUs when processing fine-grain parallelism and complex data-dependency patterns.

Method: The proposed Squire accelerator consists of general-purpose, low-power in-order cores that can efficiently communicate and access the L2 cache, integrated into a typical multicore system for accelerating dependency-bound kernels.

Result: Squire achieves speedups up to 7.64x in dynamic programming kernels and provides a 3.66x acceleration for an end-to-end application, while reducing energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%.

Conclusion: Squire demonstrates a significant improvement in performance and energy efficiency for HPC applications, bridging the gap between flexibility, energy efficiency, and performance in dependency-bound workloads.

Abstract: Multiple HPC applications are often bottlenecked by compute-intensive kernels
implementing complex dependency patterns (data-dependency bound). Traditional
general-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain
parallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency
patterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers
(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved
performance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and
programming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different
workloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit
fine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire
accelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can
rapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2
cache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical
multicore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within
parallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate
Squire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex
dependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end
read-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups
up to 7.64$\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an
acceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\times$. In addition, Squire
reduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%
compared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeBERTa-KC, a model for classifying knowledge construction levels in online science discourse using a novel dataset and advanced deep learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create automated tools capable of analyzing knowledge construction levels in informal digital learning environments, particularly addressing class imbalances in online science discourse.

Method: A transformer-based model, DeBERTa-KC, was developed using DeBERTa-v3 with enhancements like Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization. A 20,000-sample corpus spanning four categories was created, with training and evaluation conducted through a reproducible end-to-end pipeline and 10-fold cross-validation.

Result: DeBERTa-KC achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.836 ± 0.008, significantly outperforming traditional and transformer-based baselines. The model showed strong sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement (Explore and Negotiate categories).

Conclusion: Large language models, enhanced with sophisticated techniques, can effectively analyze nuanced indicators of knowledge construction in online learning environments, paving the way for scalable tools to assess epistemic engagement.

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes AI-generated lesson plans on teaching the Electromagnetic Spectrum using different language models and prompt frameworks, focusing on readability, accuracy, alignment, and cognitive demand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated lesson plans across models and structured prompt frameworks.

Method: Five AI models and three prompt frameworks were analyzed through the generation of lesson plans, assessed on readability, factual accuracy, standards alignment, and cognitive demand.

Result: DeepSeek produced the most readable plans, while the RACE framework excelled in accuracy and curriculum alignment. Learning objectives were primarily at basic cognitive levels (Remember/Understand). Combining a readability-optimized model with the RACE framework was most effective.

Conclusion: Model selection impacts readability, while prompt frameworks determine factual and instructional reliability. The best configuration involves combining specific models and frameworks for optimized lesson plans.

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [44] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework to tackle error cascades in discrete diffusion models for vision-language tasks, ensuring better coherence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models face challenges in practical application due to error cascades during parallel decoding, which lead to issues like syntax errors and semantic inaccuracies.

Method: ReDiff employs a two-stage training process: training the model to revise synthetic errors for foundational revision capability, and using an online self-correction loop where the model revises its own flawed drafts by learning from expert corrections.

Result: ReDiff achieves significant improvements in coherence, factual accuracy, and efficiency for parallel generation tasks compared to traditional denoising methods.

Conclusion: ReDiff successfully mitigates error cascades in discrete diffusion models, enabling stable and accurate parallel generation for vision-language tasks through error refinement and self-correction strategies.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [45] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sparse Tracing introduces an efficient technique to analyze attention in Large Language Models (LLMs) with long contexts using dynamic sparse attention, saving memory while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding attention patterns in LLMs for long contexts, which traditionally requires substantial memory due to quadratic scaling.

Method: The authors propose 'Sparse Tracing,' which uses a hierarchical pruning algorithm named 'Stream' to estimate sparse attention masks with near-linear time complexity $O(T \log T)$ and linear space $O(T)$.

Result: Stream shows the ability to prune 97-99% of token interactions for chain-of-thought traces while retaining critical pathways and reducing memory requirements, achieving efficient interpretability on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: This method democratizes LLM interpretability by making long context attention analysis efficient and accessible with consumer-grade hardware, without significant performance trade-offs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach using a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze unstructured Electronic Health Record (EHR) text for determining HIV test eligibility, achieving high accuracy and low false negative rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficient HIV screening and early diagnosis using EHRs, particularly by utilizing unstructured text data like clinical notes, which are often overlooked by traditional methods.

Method: The researchers developed a novel pipeline leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze unstructured EHR text and identify patients' eligibility for HIV testing.

Result: The pipeline demonstrated high accuracy and a low false negative rate when applied to clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam.

Conclusion: Incorporating LLMs for analyzing unstructured EHR text is a promising approach for enhancing the efficiency of HIV screening and diagnosis, particularly in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the use of large language models (LLMs) in life cycle assessment (LCA), assessing their reliability and pitfalls, with concerns about inaccuracies and hallucinated outputs, while noting potential in simplifying tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study responds to the increasing exploration of LLMs in LCA and the lack of standardized evaluation methods in a domain lacking clear consensus or ground truths.

Method: The researchers evaluated 11 LLMs across 22 LCA tasks, collecting 168 reviews from 17 experienced practitioners. Assessments focused on scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness, verifiability, and adherence to instructions.

Result: 37% of responses had inaccuracies; hallucination rates for citations reached up to 40%. Models generally performed well with explanation quality, accuracy, and adherence. Open-weight LLMs performed comparably or surpassed closed-weight ones in some aspects.

Conclusion: LLMs in LCA show promise in reducing labor for simple tasks but also pose risks when used naively. Their ungrounded use can lead to significant errors, necessitating careful application and grounding mechanisms.

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [48] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces game-based evaluations, specifically using the Dixit card game, to holistically and objectively assess the abilities of multi-modal large language models (MLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLM evaluation methods, such as static benchmarks or human/model comparisons, have limitations like subjectivity, high costs, and susceptibility to exploitation of superficial shortcuts. There is a need for a more robust and engaging evaluation framework.

Method: The authors propose a game-based evaluation framework and specifically implement it using the Dixit card game. Players, including MLMs, generate captions to trick others into selecting specific cards, testing multiple abilities under fixed, objective rules.

Result: Experiments with five different MLMs show that Dixit-based win-rate rankings correlate perfectly with popular benchmark rankings. Additionally, human and MLM engagements in Dixit revealed differences in strategies and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Game-based evaluations, like Dixit, provide a competitive, holistic, and objective method to assess MLM capabilities and reveal areas of improvement.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The research explores DeepSeek-R1, a Large Language Model (LLM), for its potential in improving decision-making within operations research (OR), particularly in optimization modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge in operations research of relying on domain expertise to translate real-world problems into mathematical models, by leveraging LLMs to bridge this gap.

Method: Systematic evaluation of DeepSeek-R1 compared to previous LLMs using benchmarks like NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and ComplexOR. Mitigation strategies such as a hallucination taxonomy, Few-shot Learning, Tool Calling, and Multi-agent Framework are employed to enhance accuracy.

Result: DeepSeek-R1 showcases promising performance improvement in real-world optimization modeling, overcoming some limitations of traditional methods and prior LLMs.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates high potential for applied operations research scenarios, particularly in reducing hallucinations and improving user-aligned outputs through advanced techniques.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel memory-augmented framework allowing large language models (LLMs) to learn classification tasks from labeled examples without parameter updates, achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating LLMs via fine-tuning is resource-intensive, inflexible, and lacks transparency, necessitating alternatives for adaptive learning.

Method: The framework employs episodic memory for critiques of individual examples and semantic memory for general task-level guidance, leveraging these components to improve learning on diverse tasks.

Result: The approach demonstrated up to 24.8% accuracy improvement compared to retrieval-based baselines and revealed distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and open-source models in handling data types.

Conclusion: Memory-driven learning enhances adaptability and interpretability in LLM agents, presenting a promising alternative to conventional fine-tuning for task-specific applications.

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR is a groundbreaking framework for unsupervised lyric translation, excelling in aligning musical and linguistic constraints while improving coherence and rhyme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lyric translation methods struggle with balancing musical constraints and linguistic coherence, especially across paragraphs.

Method: LyriCAR employs an adaptive curriculum strategy and difficulty-aware curriculum design, aiding the model in handling increasingly complex challenges efficiently.

Result: Extensive experiments show LyriCAR outperforms strong baselines in both translation quality and multidimensional reward metrics, while reducing training steps by 40%.

Conclusion: LyriCAR sets a new standard for lyric translation, enhancing performance and efficiency in balancing musical and linguistic requirements.

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) with symbolic natural language understanding (NLU) to leverage broad coverage and structured relational reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinations and inconsistencies, by combining them with the structured reasoning abilities of symbolic NLU systems.

Method: The hybrid approach uses LLMs for text rephrasing, simplification, and filling knowledge gaps, while employing symbolic NLU for generating relational representations and enabling incremental learning.

Result: The hybrid methodology outperforms symbolic-only systems in extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts.

Conclusion: A hybrid framework can capitalize on the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic NLU, improving reasoning and learning capabilities in specific NLU tasks.

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm for parsing sentences into dependency trees, inspired by human brain parsing behavior, with a worst-case complexity of O(n^3).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop a parsing algorithm that mimics the human brain's approach to parsing language, focusing on dependency structures.

Method: An algorithm is introduced that parses sentences one word at a time, attaching words immediately when possible, instead of using traditional phrase-structure parsing.

Result: The algorithm operates similarly to phrase-structure parsing with a complexity of O(n^3), although the worst-case scenario is rare in natural human language.

Conclusion: The algorithm aligns with the claimed properties of human sentence parsing and provides an efficient alternative for dependency tree generation.

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of medical datasets like MedQA, proposes a paradigm for clinical decision-making evaluation, reviews existing methods, and discusses challenges for developing clinically meaningful large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the evaluation and development of large language models in clinical decision-making tasks by addressing the limitations of existing medical datasets and benchmarks like MedQA that simplify real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a unifying paradigm for characterizing clinical decision-making tasks, summarize existing benchmarks along two dimensions, review training/test-time methods, and extend evaluation criteria beyond accuracy to efficiency and explainability.

Result: The results include a standardized framework for clinical datasets, an overview of methods that optimize clinical decision-making by LLMs, and an extended focus on evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The paper provides clarity and guidance for developing clinically meaningful LLMs by addressing current limitations, introducing a standardized paradigm, and highlighting open challenges for improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in natural language processing for Greek with new transformer models and curated datasets, particularly for the legal domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of resources, fragmented research, and reliance on outdated transformer models hinder NLP progress for Modern Greek, especially in analyzing long legal documents.

Method: Created large-scale curated Greek corpora with quality-based filtering. Pre-trained and evaluated modern architectures like ELECTRA, ConvBERT, and ModernBERT.

Result: Developed Greek Embedding Models that significantly outperform current baselines, including bilingual Greek-English models tailored for the legal domain.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and success of modern architectures for Greek language NLP, especially for specialized applications like legal text analysis.

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

TL;DR: This thesis explores methods to enhance transfer learning for sequence labeling tasks by proposing multi-task models, architectural modifications, and fine-tuning frameworks specifically for autoregressive large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in transfer learning by improving the effectiveness of pre-trained neural language models for sequence labeling tasks in different contexts, such as domain transfer and text generation.

Method: The methods include: introducing a multi-task model with additional signals for domain transfer, modifying autoregressive large language model architectures to enable bidirectional information flow, and leveraging supervised in-context fine-tuning for generative tasks.

Result: The proposed approaches significantly improve the performance of pre-trained neural language models on sequence labeling tasks through targeted transfer learning adaptations.

Conclusion: Targeted transfer learning strategies, combining new frameworks, modifications, and multi-tasking approaches, demonstrate significant improvements in the adaptability and performance of large pre-trained language models for sequence labeling tasks.

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolScope improves tool selection accuracy for large language models by addressing issues of redundancy and relevance in toolsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges with redundant tools and context limits when dealing with large toolsets.

Method: ToolScope includes ToolScopeMerger for auto-correcting tool redundancy and ToolScopeRetriever for ranking and selecting relevant tools.

Result: ToolScope achieves an improvement of 8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy according to evaluations across benchmarks and LLMs.

Conclusion: ToolScope effectively enhances tool use efficiency and accuracy in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge (BLanCK) dataset to address gaps in capturing cultural nuances of low-resource cultures like Bengali in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the existing gaps in multilingual language models' ability to capture and evaluate cultural knowledge, particularly for low-resource languages like Bengali.

Method: The authors created the BLanCK dataset, which includes folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional dialects, to test the cultural knowledge of large multilingual language models.

Result: The study highlights that multilingual language models perform poorly in cultural knowledge-related tasks but show significant improvement when provided with context.

Conclusion: There is a need for culturally curated training data and context-aware architectures to improve the performance of language models in low-resource cultural contexts.

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware

*Mehrdad Ghassabi,Sadra Hakim,Hamidreza Baradaran Kashani,Pedram Rostami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study enhances the reasoning capabilities of a Persian language model for medical question answering using Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reasoning capabilities in small language models for specialized applications, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian.

Method: The study leverages RLAIF to generate preferred-rejected answer pairs, trains a model using these pairs with DPO, and creates a dataset of reasoning trajectories with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses. A baseline model is trained on a comparatively small dataset derived from a translated and modified medical QA dataset.

Result: The trained model significantly improved its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian and outperformed a larger predecessor model (gaokerena-V) trained on a much larger dataset.

Conclusion: Focused reasoning training methods like RLAIF and DPO can efficiently and effectively enhance domain-specific language models, even with limited data resources.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

*Zhaoyi Joey Hou,Bowei Alvin Zhang,Yining Lu,Bhiman Kumar Baghel,Anneliese Brei,Ximing Lu,Meng Jiang,Faeze Brahman,Snigdha Chaturvedi,Haw-Shiuan Chang,Daniel Khashabi,Xiang Lorraine Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents CreativityPrism, a framework for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) creativity across multiple dimensions and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified framework to assess creativity in LLMs and the fragmented approaches across different domains and tasks necessitate a comprehensive evaluation method.

Method: CreativityPrism evaluates LLMs by breaking creativity into quality, novelty, and diversity dimensions across nine tasks, three domains (divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning), and employs twenty specific evaluation metrics.

Result: The evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs showed a gap between proprietary and open-sourced models, with limited generalization of creative performance across tasks. Strong correlations exist between quality and diversity metrics, but novelty correlates weakly with other dimensions.

Conclusion: Strong performance in one creativity domain or dimension by LLMs does not guarantee generalization to others, emphasizing the importance of a holistic evaluation framework for assessing model creativity.

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

### [61] [Leveraging the Power of Large Language Models in Entity Linking via Adaptive Routing and Targeted Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20098)
*Yajie Li,Albert Galimov,Mitra Datta Ganapaneni,Pujitha Thejaswi,De Meng,Priyanshu Kumar,Saloni Potdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARTER, a pipeline approach for Entity Linking that combines various strategies to enhance efficiency and performance without extensive model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EL models typically rely heavily on large annotated datasets and complex fine-tuning, which presents inefficiencies. This work seeks to reduce dependency on training datasets while maintaining high efficiency and accuracy through a novel approach.

Method: The authors propose ARTER, a pipeline combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning. It categorizes mentions into easy and hard cases, handling them with low-computational or targeted LLM-based reasoning accordingly.

Result: ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to 4.47% and achieves an average gain of 2.53% across multiple datasets. It matches the performance of other LLM-based reasoning methods while using half the computational resources.

Conclusion: By leveraging complementary signals and adaptive processing, ARTER efficiently enhances entity linking performance, reducing computational costs and eliminating deep fine-tuning, making it a practical and effective solution.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

*Haoyuan Li,Zhengyuan Shen,Sullam Jeoung,Yueyan Chen,Jiayu Li,Qi Zhu,Shuai Wang,Vassilis Ioannidis,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoundRL is proposed as a new method for token-level text segmentation and label prediction in complex structured texts like those in technical reports and AI prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasingly complex structured texts which include elements like tables and code snippets are challenging for conventional segmentation methods.

Method: BoundRL uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to generate starting tokens for segmentation while minimizing hallucination and improving semantic alignment.

Result: BoundRL enables small language models to outperform larger models in few-shot prompting, and its rewards improve performance beyond supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: BoundRL is an efficient solution for segmenting complex structured texts, demonstrating improved performance, generalization, and reduced inference costs, especially with smaller models.

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

### [63] [Are Stereotypes Leading LLMs' Zero-Shot Stance Detection ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20154)
*Anthony Dubreuil,Antoine Gourru,Christine Largeron,Amine Trabelsi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) during stance detection by examining attributes like dialect and text complexity, uncovering stereotype-driven behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate and address overlooked biases in LLMs within stance detection tasks, particularly concerning sensitive social and political aspects.

Method: This study evaluates pre-existing stance detection datasets, annotating them with attributes such as dialect and text complexity/readability to analyze their impact on LLMs’ performance in zero-shot settings.

Result: Findings reveal that LLMs display significant stereotypes, such as associating African American dialect with specific political views and equating pro-marijuana stances with low text complexity.

Conclusion: LLMs show biases that affect stance detection, highlighting the necessity for interventions to mitigate stereotype-driven decision-making in these models.

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

*Tian Lan,Bin Zhu,Qianghuai Jia,Junyang Ren,Haijun Li,Longyue Wang,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepWideSearch is a benchmark designed to test search agents for their ability to combine multi-hop deep reasoning with wide-scale information retrieval. Current state-of-the-art agents achieve a low success rate, highlighting challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search agents struggle with combining deep reasoning and wide-scale retrieval, which hinders their effectiveness in real-world applications like market analysis and business decisions.

Method: Researchers developed DeepWideSearch, a benchmark converted from established datasets, containing 220 questions across 15 domains requiring multi-hop reasoning and extensive data handling.

Result: State-of-the-art agents demonstrated a low average success rate of 2.39% on the DeepWideSearch benchmark. Researchers identified main failure modes including reflection issues, poor retrieval, overdependence on internal knowledge, and context processing limitations.

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch exposes significant weaknesses in current search agent architectures. Its public release aims to drive advancements toward more capable and robust information-seeking systems.

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

*Yuhang Zhou,Mingrui Zhang,Ke Li,Mingyi Wang,Qiao Liu,Qifei wang,Jiayi Liu,Fei Liu,Serena Li,Weiwi Li,Mingze Gao,Abhishek Kumar,Xiangjun Fan,Zhuokai Zhao,Lizhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework integrating structured reasoning and precise table manipulation to address limitations in LLM-based table understanding. It achieves significant results on TableBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively understanding and reasoning over tables is vital for real-world applications, but existing LLM and tool-based methods have critical limitations, such as arithmetic errors or lack of semantic understanding.

Method: Mixture-of-Minds framework decomposes table reasoning into three specialized agents (planning, coding, answering) and leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and reinforcement learning for self-improvement.

Result: The proposed framework achieves 62.13% on TableBench and surpasses OpenAI-o4-mini-high, showcasing its effectiveness in combining structured workflows with reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of integrating multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning approaches to improve table understanding and reasoning capabilities in AI models.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

*Maggie Bai,Ava Kim Cohen,Eleanor Koss,Charlie Lichtenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) through five tasks, revealing that while they perform moderately at small scales, their accuracy significantly degrades with increasing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether current LLMs possess robust spatial reasoning and computational abilities, particularly in handling text-based spatial problems.

Method: LLMs were tested on a series of tasks such as quadrant identification, geometric transformations, and tile sliding, with increasing difficulty through scaled grid dimensions.

Result: LLMs showed moderate success with simple tasks, but their performance notably declined with complexity, averaging a 42.7% drop in accuracy and up to 84% in extreme cases.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning at scale due to inadequate spatial representations. This gap highlights the need for new benchmarks that integrate language and geometry for LLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

### [67] [Decoding-Free Sampling Strategies for LLM Marginalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20208)
*David Pohl,Marco Cognetta,Junyoung Lee,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores decoding-free strategies to estimate marginal probabilities in language models without relying on expensive generation steps, achieving faster and sufficiently accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models currently evaluate text probabilities by considering only specific tokenizations, which limits accuracy and demands high computational resources for marginalization via sampling.

Method: The authors investigate decoding-free sampling strategies as alternatives to traditional sampling methods that involve computationally expensive generation steps. These approaches are both model and tokenizer agnostic.

Result: The decoding-free sampling methods yielded sufficiently accurate marginal probability approximations while significantly reducing runtime costs. The methods were tested on downstream inference tasks to demonstrate their utility.

Conclusion: Decoding-free sampling strategies can effectively approximate marginal probabilities without expensive computational requirements, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy in language model evaluation.

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

### [68] [Tri-Modal Severity Fused Diagnosis across Depression and Post-traumatic Stress Disorders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20239)
*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a tri-modal framework for assessing depression and PTSD simultaneously, addressing the need for severity-aware, cross-disorder diagnostics. The framework integrates textual, audio, and facial data to provide detailed severity estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diagnostics for depression and PTSD are often binary and disorder-specific, which limits their clinical utility. This paper aims to create a tool for severity-based, cross-disorder assessment and provide interpretable explanatory models for decision support.

Method: The framework combines text (sentence-level embeddings), audio (log Mel statistics with deltas), and facial signals (action units, gaze, head, and pose features). A calibrated late fusion classifier integrates these modalities, offering probability estimates and feature-level attributions for depression and PTSD severities.

Result: On DAIC-derived datasets, the tri-modal method outperformed unimodal approaches in multi-disorder settings. It demonstrated improved decision utility, robustness against noisy/missing data, and reduced regression errors for PTSD. Text was most useful for depression, while audio and facial inputs contributed more to PTSD severity estimation.

Conclusion: This integrated approach can effectively assess depression and PTSD severity, offering accurate and robust diagnostics with interpretable outputs. It has potential applicability in clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

*Beiya Dai,Yuliang Liu,Daozheng Xue,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Xinbing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM introduces the next-context prediction mechanism to enhance language model capabilities in capturing higher-level semantic structures and long-range contextual relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token-level prediction in existing language model pretraining limits the ability to understand broader semantic structures and long-range context.

Method: ContextLM incorporates next-context prediction by training the model on predictive representations of multi-token contexts using future token chunks alongside standard next-token prediction.

Result: ContextLM improves model perplexity and downstream task performance while enhancing long-range coherence and attention allocation in experiments on GPT2 and Pythia models up to 1.5B parameters.

Conclusion: Next-context prediction in language models is a scalable and efficient technique that enhances semantic understanding and coherence with minimal extra computational cost.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses citation failures in LLM-based RAG systems, introducing a benchmark (CITECONTROL) to analyze such failures and a framework (CITENTION) to improve citation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and improve citation accuracy in LLM-based RAG systems, which currently struggle with citing complete evidence while generating helpful responses.

Method: The authors adopt a two-step approach: first, analyzing citation failure patterns using a new benchmark called CITECONTROL, and second, proposing a framework, CITENTION, that combines generative, attention-based, and retrieval-based citation methods.

Result: CITECONTROL showed that citation failures are linked to relational complexity, and combining citation methods can improve performance. The proposed CITENTION framework demonstrated improved citation quality both on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings.

Conclusion: Combining diverse citation methods can effectively mitigate citation failures in LLM-based RAG systems, and the study provides valuable resources (data and code) for further research.

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges and effectiveness of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in table question answering (TQA), highlighting their limitations and suggesting ways for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the applicability of PRMs, widely effective in mathematical reasoning, to tasks involving semi-structured data like table question answering which introduces unique challenges.

Method: The study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art generative PRMs in TQA settings, analyzing performance from step-level and answer-level perspectives, and highlighting correlations and limitations.

Result: PRMs that integrate textual and code verification help in solution selection but lack generalization for out-of-domain data. Weak step dependencies and loose causal reasoning links limit performance.

Conclusion: Current PRMs are not optimal for TQA tasks. The study offers insights into improving PRMs, stressing the need for robust, process-aware verifiers to tackle the limitations identified.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework to enhance large reasoning models (LRMs) in complex mathematical reasoning by optimizing their interaction with Code Interpreters (CIs) through Hint-Engineering and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs struggle with handling complex mathematical reasoning tasks due to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. Integrating computational tools like Code Interpreters offers potential, but creates challenges due to conflicting approaches between probabilistic reasoning of LRMs and deterministic CI knowledge.

Method: CoRT employs Hint-Engineering to synthesize high-quality, code-integrated reasoning data and uses supervised fine-tuning, rejection sampling, and reinforcement learning to optimize LRM-CI interaction during multi-round reasoning.

Result: CoRT improves reasoning accuracy, yielding absolute performance increases of 4% and 8% on two large models across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while significantly reducing token usage (32B model by 30%, 1.5B by 50%).

Conclusion: CoRT effectively enhances reasoning capability and efficiency of LRMs, addressing inefficiencies in handling mathematical operations. The framework demonstrates notable improvements in model accuracy and token usage. Models and code are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI

learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging

efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

### [73] [Evaluating Latent Knowledge of Public Tabular Datasets in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20351)
*Matteo Silvestri,Flavio Giorgi,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show reasoning abilities on tabular data benchmarks but are often affected by dataset contamination due to semantic cues, which challenges genuine reasoning evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether LLMs truly understand and reason over structured tabular data or if they exploit pre-existing semantic leaks in benchmarks.

Method: Conducted controlled probing experiments to identify semantic contamination effects on LLM performance using tabular datasets.

Result: Performance of LLMs declines significantly when semantic cues are randomized, suggesting reliance on memorization over generalization.

Conclusion: LLMs sometimes exploit dataset contamination rather than demonstrating genuine reasoning; evaluation methods should address this issue to gauge authentic reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

*Wenxuan Zhang,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Yonghe Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreeChunker, a new chunking strategy for better retrieval in RAG systems, offering enhanced adaptability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems rely on effective chunking, but current methods with fixed-granularity limits adaptability to varying query requirements.

Method: The authors propose FreeChunker, a framework treating sentences as atomic units and enabling flexible retrieval by combining sentences without relying on static segmentation.

Result: FreeChunker demonstrates superior retrieval performance and computational efficiency on LongBench V2 tests compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: FreeChunker transforms traditional chunking with a flexible, efficient approach, improving adaptability and retrieval performance in RAG systems.

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

*Francesca Padovani,Bastian Bunzeck,Manar Ali,Omar Momen,Arianna Bisazza,Hendrik Buschmeier,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the impact of pre-training exclusively on dialogue data for small language models, finding that specialized fine-tuning methods enhance communication-focused tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of pre-training solely on dialogue data in developing small language models tailored for communicative generation tasks.

Method: Develop a pre-trained 'llamalogue' model using dialogue-specific data, followed by applying fine-tuning strategies like PPO and DPO on dialogue benchmarks.

Result: Models showed lower performance on standard BabyLM benchmarks but excelled in custom dialogue tasks; DPO fine-tuning improved their results further.

Conclusion: Pre-training on dialogue data with DPO fine-tuning yielded models proficient in dialogue-specific applications, highlighting potential for targeted communicative tasks.

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

*Jaehyung Seo,Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how negated text affects hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs), creating a dataset to refine understanding of this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored challenge of LLM hallucination detection in scenarios involving negated text.

Method: The researchers investigate LLM behavior in negated contexts, reconstruct existing datasets with negated expressions, and analyze LLMs at a token level.

Result: Experiments show LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text, often providing unfaithful or inconsistent judgments.

Conclusion: Negations introduce significant challenges in hallucination detection, revealing areas for improvement in LLMs' handling of contextual shifts.

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

TL;DR: NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual are advanced transformer models optimized for Hebrew NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and enhancing capabilities in retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities by introducing improved BERT-style models based on modern transformer architectures.

Method: NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual were trained using the NeoBERT architecture, focusing specifically on Hebrew texts. The training process aimed to create models with superior performance on Hebrew and bilingual benchmarks.

Result: The new models demonstrated exceptional performance on Hebrew benchmarks and showed strong retrieval task results, outperforming existing multilingual models of similar size.

Conclusion: NeoDictaBERT provides a robust foundation for Hebrew NLP and retrieval tasks, advancing research and development opportunities for the community.

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces ContingentChat, a framework to improve multi-turn dialogue contingency in BabyLM models via post-training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving contingency, a crucial property for meaningful child-caregiver dialogues, in BabyLM trained on limited data.

Method: The researchers developed ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework, employing a novel alignment dataset for post-training and adaptive teacher decoding strategies to enhance dialogue quality.

Result: BabyLM, post-trained with ContingentChat, generated responses that were more grammatical and cohesive, though adaptive teacher strategies showed limited additional improvement.

Conclusion: Targeted post-training approaches make notable improvements in dialogue quality but achieving optimal contingency in BabyLMs remains challenging.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

*Zhijie Deng,Zhouan Shen,Ling Li,Yao Zhou,Zhaowei Zhu,Yanji He,Wei Wang,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Instruction Distillation and LM-Mixup methods to convert low-quality instruction data into high-quality outputs for improving LLM performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of utilizing low-quality instruction data, which is often discarded despite being abundant, to improve the performance of instruction-tuned LLMs.

Method: Developed MIXTURE, a dataset pairing low-quality instruction clusters with high-quality distillations, and introduced LM-Mixup using supervised fine-tuning combined with reinforcement learning optimized by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs using distilled data from LM-Mixup outperforms training on the entire dataset and rivals state-of-the-art methods, proving the value of low-quality data when effectively processed.

Conclusion: Low-quality instruction datasets can be transformed into valuable resources that enhance the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of LM-Mixup in data augmentation and instruction tuning.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates four approaches (VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, CoCoA) for estimating uncertainty in LLM outputs, with CoCoA performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the reliability issues of LLMs by improving their confidence estimation methods.

Method: Systematic evaluation of four confidence estimation approaches using four question-answering tasks on a state-of-the-art LLM model.

Result: CoCoA outperforms other methods by yielding the best overall reliability, enhancing calibration and discrimination of correct answers.

Conclusion: Each method captures different aspects of confidence, but the CoCoA hybrid approach is recommended for better reliability in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Motivation: The authors aim to enhance predictive capabilities in language modeling tasks and achieve better performance in strict-small track for BabyLM Challenge 2025.

Method: They propose an advanced MLM technique with adaptive token masking based on prediction difficulty and integrate sub-token embeddings for improved morphological generalization.

Result: The new MLM approach shows significant improvement in performance for (Super)GLUE tasks and surpasses baseline results in the BabyLM Challenge strict-small track.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully improve language modeling and set a higher benchmark in the challenge's strict-small track.

Abstract: We describe our strategy for the 2025 edition of the BabyLM Challenge. Our
main contribution is that of an improved form of Masked Language Modeling
(MLM), which adapts the probabilities of the tokens masked according to the
model's ability to predict them. The results show a substantial increase in
performance on (Super)GLUE tasks over the standard MLM. We also incorporate
sub-token embeddings, finding that this increases the model's morphological
generalization capabilities. Our submission beats the baseline in the

TL;DR: The paper proposes RECALL, a new framework for merging knowledge in large language models (LLMs) to enable continual learning without needing historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often struggle with continual learning as they face issues like catastrophic forgetting and reliance on historical data. This paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The RECALL framework computes inter-model similarity using layered hidden representations over clustered samples, enabling adaptive parameter fusion. This allows domain-general features to be retained in shallow layers and task-specific adaptation in deeper layers.

Result: RECALL outperforms previous methods in knowledge retention and generalization across five NLP tasks and several continual learning scenarios without using historical data.

Conclusion: This method provides a scalable, data-free solution for evolving large language models, while achieving seamless multi-domain integration and resisting catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

### [84] [Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models To Act Like They Are Deployed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20487)
*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for mitigating evaluation-awareness in large language models by using activation steering, enhancing the reliability of safety evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) may modify their behavior when they detect they are under evaluation, which compromises the integrity and accuracy of safety evaluations.

Method: The authors train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step process: (1) continued pretraining on specific documents to simulate evaluation-awareness and (2) training with expert iteration to implement evaluation-specific task features. Then they apply activation steering to counter evaluation-awareness.

Result: The study demonstrates that activation steering suppresses evaluation-awareness in LLMs, enabling them to act consistently between evaluation and deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: Activation steering can improve AI evaluation reliability by aligning large language model performance in evaluation and deployment settings, ensuring safety and alignment goals are more effectively met.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc method for improving large language model alignment with diverse human preferences without retraining, by leveraging neighborhood sampling and selection strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of large language models in aligning with diverse, individual human preferences, especially for nuanced requests not reflected in training data.

Method: The authors introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), which uses a post-hoc approach to sample responses from a neighborhood of related preferences and selects the best candidate based on alignment with the user’s intent.

Result: Experiments across three alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, SFT) showed RPS improved robustness without retraining, achieving high win rates (up to 69%) for challenging, underrepresented preferences.

Conclusion: RPS provides a practical, robust, and theoretically-grounded solution to address the preference coverage gap in large language model alignment, enhancing reliability without additional model training.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Sequence Iteration (HSEQ) for accurate and efficient heterogeneous question answering across diverse evidence types. It improves retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by employing guided iterative evidence gathering and synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address brittleness in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multi-step questions and heterogeneous evidence sources, aiming to balance accuracy, latency, and resource usage.

Method: The HSEQ framework linearizes documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into hierarchical sequences with structural tags. It then uses agents: a Head Agent for guiding retrieval and an Iteration Agent for structure-aware evidence expansion.

Result: Experiments on datasets such as HotpotQA, HybridQA/TAT-QA, and MetaQA show consistent improvements in exact match (EM) and F1 scores over existing methods, with enhanced efficiency.

Conclusion: HSEQ delivers format-agnostic operation across diverse evidence types, reduces unnecessary actions while maintaining accuracy, and ensures consistent and auditable answers through evidence canonicalization.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address political biases in LLMs by understanding their translation quality for varying political affiliations, moving beyond traditional English survey evaluations.

Method: It employs a new 21-way multiparallel version of EuroParl dataset to systematically analyze translation quality for speeches in the European Parliament, including related metadata such as political affiliations.

Result: Findings reveal systematic differences in translation quality among majority parties (left, center, right) and outsider parties.

Conclusion: The work highlights potential political biases in translation outputs of LLMs and creates a large dataset for further multilingual and political bias studies.

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of

### [88] [ARC-Encoder: learning compressed text representations for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20535)
*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARC-Encoder, a method to compress context for use in language models, reducing inference costs without harming general abilities and compatibility with multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longer context lengths in modern techniques like retrieval-augmented generation and chain-of-thought reasoning increase computational costs. Existing context compression methods often require fine-tuning or structural changes to models, limiting their broader applicability and impacting general capabilities.

Method: The authors develop the ARC-Encoder, a standalone encoder that transforms input context into continuous representations, which are used in place of token embeddings in decoder LLMs. They systematically explore training and architecture options, achieving significant compression (4-8x fewer representations) without requiring modifications to LLM architectures.

Result: ARC-Encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, reducing computational costs and retaining flexibility by working seamlessly across multiple LLM decoders.

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder provides an efficient and adaptable approach for context compression, avoiding sacrifices in model generalization or compatibility. It represents a step forward in creating portable, high-performing encoders for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder
, fine-tuning dataset and pretrained models are available at

### [89] [The Dog the Cat Chased Stumped the Model: Measuring When Language Models Abandon Structure for Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20543)
*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CenterBench, a dataset designed to evaluate language models' syntactic versus semantic comprehension abilities using center-embedded sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether language models perform true structural analysis of syntax or rely on semantic pattern recognition when processing complex sentences.

Method: The study created CenterBench, a dataset containing 9,720 comprehension questions focusing on center-embedded sentences. It included syntactically identical but semantically implausible sentences with six types of comprehension questions. Performance was tested across six models.

Result: Models showed a growing performance gap between plausible and implausible sentences with increasing linguistic complexity, indicating a shift from structural to semantic reasoning. Semantic plausibility negatively impacted causal reasoning performance. Some models showed inaccuracies due to semantic shortcuts and overthinking.

Conclusion: CenterBench provides a tool to diagnose when language models prioritize semantic pattern matching over syntactic analysis, revealing their limitations in handling complex sentence structures.

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

*Jinchang Luo,Mingquan Cheng,Fan Wan,Ni Li,Xiaoling Xia,Shuangshuang Tian,Tingcheng Bian,Haiwei Wang,Haohuan Fu,Yan Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GlobalRAG enhances multi-hop question answering by addressing issues of global planning and unfaithful execution through reinforcement learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite improvements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) through reinforcement learning, multi-hop QA faces challenges in global reasoning and execution fidelity.

Method: GlobalRAG uses reinforcement learning to decompose questions into subgoals, iteratively refine evidence, and implement rewards like Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward alongside weight annealing strategies.

Result: GlobalRAG outperforms strong baselines by using less training data, achieving average improvements of 14.2% in EM and F1 scores.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG is a promising approach for enhancing multi-hop QA, showcasing effectiveness across benchmarks while being data-efficient.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

*Zhouwei Zhai,Mengxiang Chen,Haoyun Xia,Jin Li,Renquan Zhou,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework (MACDF) to overcome the limitations of traditional retrieval-ranking in e-commerce search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs, and lack of professional guidance in the traditional query-item matching paradigm of e-commerce search.

Method: Introduces MACDF, which moves from passive search to proactive decision support, using multi-agent cognitive systems.

Result: The MACDF demonstrates improved recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction in offline evaluations for complex queries; online A/B tests on JD platform prove its practical efficacy.

Conclusion: The study underscores the potential of multi-agent cognitive systems in revolutionizing e-commerce search by providing proactive guidance and resolving the limitations of traditional systems.

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT can code communication data effectively and exhibits no significant bias against gender and racial demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about potential demographic bias in AI-based coding of communication data and facilitate large-scale communication assessment.

Method: The study analyzes ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a typical coding framework, across gender and racial groups, in multiple collaborative tasks.

Result: ChatGPT-based coding displayed no significant bias across different gender and racial groups.

Conclusion: ChatGPT is suitable for coding collaborative communication data in large-scale assessments without demographic bias.

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

*Haoyu Wang,Sihang Jiang,Yuyan Chen,Yitong Wang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates curiosity in large language models (LLMs), revealing they display a strong thirst for knowledge but adopt conservative strategies in uncertain situations. The study links curiosity to improved reasoning and learning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models (LLMs) can exhibit curiosity-driven learning behaviors akin to humans.

Method: The Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR) is adapted to develop an evaluation framework that assesses Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social Curiosity in LLMs.

Result: LLMs demonstrate stronger knowledge-seeking behavior than humans yet lean towards cautious decision-making in uncertain settings. Curious behaviors in LLMs enhance reasoning and active learning.

Conclusion: LLMs have the potential to display human-like curiosity, aiding their future learning capabilities and paving the way for innovative research in their development.

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

*Alan Saji,Raj Dabre,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Ratish Puduppully*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates how Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) handle multilingual reasoning and compares their performance when reasoning in English versus the language of the question. English reasoning tends to outperform but suffers from translation-induced errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the multilingual reasoning abilities of LRMs and understand their preference for English reasoning, which raises concerns about interpretability and cultural nuances.

Method: The researchers systematically evaluated an LRM's reasoning process in two tasks, MGSM and GPQA Diamond, across English and the original language of the questions. They analyzed answer accuracy and cognitive reasoning behaviors.

Result: English reasoning showed higher final-answer accuracy and better cognitive behaviors, especially in complex tasks, but was vulnerable to errors from translation steps, termed "Lost in Translation."

Conclusion: While English reasoning is generally more accurate, it introduces risks of translation-related errors, highlighting the importance of reasoning in the original language to avoid context misinterpretation.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

*Junghyun Min,York Hay Ng,Sophia Chan,Helena Shunhua Zhao,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CantoNLU, a benchmark for Cantonese natural language understanding, spanning seven tasks, and evaluates different models showing Cantonese-adapted models outperform others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cantonese remains under-researched due to policy restrictions and diglossia, creating the need for a standardized evaluation framework to advance natural language understanding for Cantonese.

Method: A new benchmark, CantoNLU, was proposed covering seven syntax and semantic tasks. Several models were used for performance evaluation: Mandarin-trained models, Cantonese-adapted models (from continual pre-training), and monolingual Cantonese models.

Result: Cantonese-adapted models showed the best overall performance, while monolingual models excelled in syntactic tasks. Mandarin models demonstrated competitive results in settings with limited Cantonese data.

Conclusion: Introducing CantoNLU advances Cantonese NLP, providing resources, open data, code, and model benchmarks while highlighting the need for Cantonese-adapted models for optimal performance.

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

### [97] [Neural Diversity Regularizes Hallucinations in Small Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20690)
*Kushal Chakrabarti,Nirmal Balachundhar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural diversity as a mechanism to reduce hallucinations in language models, proposing ND-LoRA to implement a decorrelated representation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models still exhibit hallucinations despite advancements in scale and resources. The paper seeks to mitigate hallucination rates by introducing the concept and implementation of neural diversity.

Method: The authors propose ND-LoRA, integrating parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, backed by theoretical proof and experimental validation of neural diversity's effect on hallucination reduction.

Result: ND-LoRA reduces hallucinations by up to 25.6% without harming general accuracy. Findings show synergistic effects of LoRA adapters and regularization, task-specific neurodiversity needs, and a clear correlation between neural correlation and hallucination rates.

Conclusion: Neural diversity is presented as a promising third axis of scaling for language models, enhancing reliability at fixed parameter and data budgets.

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

### [98] [Structure-Conditional Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20700)
*Bryan Eikema,Anna Rutkiewicz,Mario Giulianelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on adapting Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for open-ended tasks by introducing three utility function modifications that improve structural sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional similarity-based MBR decoding is effective in constrained tasks like machine translation but struggles in open-ended tasks like dialogue or instruction-following. The authors aim to address issues arising from structural variability in these tasks.

Method: The authors propose three lightweight adaptations to MBR utility functions to enhance sensitivity to latent structures. They curate a dataset capturing different structural types and introduce two metrics for evaluating structural optimality.

Result: Common similarity-based utility functions underperform on structural optimality metrics, whereas the proposed adaptations improve structural sensitivity and enhance performance on real-world benchmarks by up to 13.7% in win rate.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptations to MBR decoding successfully address challenges in open-ended tasks, demonstrating improved generation quality through increased structural sensitivity.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

### [99] [User Perceptions of Privacy and Helpfulness in LLM Responses to Privacy-Sensitive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20721)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how users perceive the privacy and helpfulness of responses from large language models (LLMs) in privacy-sensitive scenarios, revealing individual-specific differences and the inadequacy of using proxy LLMs for user compliance estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of privacy evaluations that primarily rely on proxy LLMs for assessing privacy-preservation and helpfulness, without considering actual users' perceptions.

Method: The study involved a user experiment with 94 participants evaluating 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens to gauge their perceptions of privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses.

Result: Users demonstrated low agreement on privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness, while proxy LLMs showed high agreement among themselves but low correlation with users’ evaluations.

Conclusion: Privacy and helpfulness perceptions are highly individual-specific, requiring user-centered studies to improve LLMs' alignment with real user needs and privacy expectations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on extracting fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes using various NLP methods. LLM-based approaches outperform others in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for effective methods to extract treatment and toxicity information about fluoropyrimidines, which are commonly used in cancer treatment but can cause significant toxicities and are often documented in clinical notes.

Method: A gold-standard dataset of annotated clinical notes was used to compare various NLP models: rule-based, machine learning (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression), deep learning (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language models (LLMs) using zero-shot and error-analysis prompting.

Result: LLM-based methods, particularly error-analysis prompting and zero-shot prompting, achieved the highest F1 scores for extracting treatment and toxicity data. Machine learning methods performed well, while deep learning methods were limited by small data size.

Conclusion: LLM-based NLP methods demonstrated superior performance in extracting critical oncology information, highlighting their potential to support research and pharmacovigilance in cancer treatment.

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research explores the use of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) as evaluators for machine translation (MT), proposing a methodology to improve their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LRMs' potential as evaluators for MT quality and address challenges in their application.

Method: LRMs are calibrated using synthetic, human-like thinking trajectories to improve evaluation materials and overcome issues like overthinking and scoring overestimation.

Result: Experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks showed a ~35x reduction in reasoning time and a significant improvement (+8.7 correlation points) across different LRM scales.

Conclusion: Efficiently calibrated LRMs can significantly enhance automatic MT evaluation in terms of performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a dataset and method to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on fairness-related dimensions in a real-world application context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for LLMs focus on high-level tasks and lack specificity regarding fairness implications in real-world applications.

Method: The authors construct a dataset evaluating LLMs based on a text-generation task involving product descriptions, parameterized by fairness attributes like gendered adjectives and product categories.

Result: The dataset enables identification of gaps in quality, safety, veracity, and fairness within LLMs.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new evaluation framework and resource for studying fairness-specific dimensions in LLM applications.

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

*Mutian He,Philip N. Garner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Linear-attention models suffer from forgetfulness in retrieval tasks due to finite memory. This paper investigates hybrid models that combine direct token access, using novel token eviction and sparse attention techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of linear-attention models, which struggle with forgetfulness during retrieval-heavy tasks due to restricted memory.

Method: This paper introduces hybrid models with intermediate complexity. It includes sparse attention with token eviction and proposes a novel learnable token eviction mechanism combined with sliding-window attention and lightweight CNNs.

Result: Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks demonstrate significant effectiveness in mitigating memory issues and improving retrieval performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully bridge efficiency and performance, maintaining linear attention's computational benefits while improving retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a mean-pooling approach for soft context compression in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models, achieving better performance compared to alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs and improve performance when using long contexts in retrieval-augmented generation with large language models.

Method: Proposes and evaluates a simple mean-pooling approach for context compression. Investigates its performance across datasets, model scales, and compression ratios, while also studying training for multiple compression ratios.

Result: The mean-pooling approach outperformed the compression-tokens architecture and showed robust performance across various settings. Performance drop was minimal when trained for multiple compression ratios.

Conclusion: Mean-pooling is a lightweight and effective method for soft context compression, but the trade-offs across different methods are complex and require careful consideration.

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

### [105] [On the Detectability of LLM-Generated Text: What Exactly Is LLM-Generated Text?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20810)
*Mingmeng Geng,Thierry Poibeau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in accurately detecting text generated by large language models (LLMs) and highlights shortcomings in existing benchmarks and interpretations of detector effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the increasing need to detect LLM-generated text amidst its prevalent usage, leading to challenges in defining, distinguishing, and evaluating such text due to various factors.

Method: The paper identifies intrinsic challenges, such as blurred boundaries between LLM-generated and human-written text, and highlights issues with existing detection benchmarks and methods for evaluation in real-world scenarios.

Result: The paper concludes that current detection methods are effective only under specific circumstances and that their numerical outputs often lead to misunderstandings.

Conclusion: Detectors of LLM-generated text should be used as references rather than absolute indicators, due to inherent complexities and evolving conditions in real-world applications.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones using frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning, achieving high accuracy and outperforming spatial-domain approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of photorealistic GAN-produced images challenges image forensics and systems requiring reliable authenticity.

Method: The study involves transforming images into Fourier domain using 2D DFT and training a ResNet50 network on these to detect periodic artifacts and distinguish between real and synthetic images.

Result: The frequency-domain model achieved 92.8% accuracy and an AUC of 0.95, surpassing spatial-domain models.

Conclusion: GAN-generated images have distinct frequency-domain signatures, and the proposed method shows potential in improving digital forensics and industrial AI system reliability.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Vision Transformers (ViTs) combined with contrastive learning can improve 3D shape feature representation, achieving high accuracy for 3D object analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in representation learning for 3D shapes using traditional CNN-based methods, which struggle to capture critical shape relationships and require extensive labeled data.

Method: The authors employ Vision Transformers (ViTs) with both supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning objectives to enhance 3D shape representation learning.

Result: Their approach achieves promising performance in multi-view 3D analysis on downstream tasks, including a 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10 with supervised contrastive losses.

Conclusion: Combining ViTs with contrastive objectives improves 3D representation learning by capturing global shape semantics and refining discriminative features, addressing the limitations of CNNs and reducing dependence on labeled data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack improves 3D multi-object tracking by introducing a transformer-based smoother and fusion-driven tracker utilizing data from both cameras and LiDAR, achieving robust identity propagation and strong performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in multi-object tracking, particularly under conditions like occlusion and viewpoint changes, by incorporating multimodal sensor data and refining tracking accuracy and efficiency.

Method: FutrTrack integrates a transformer-based smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. The system uses multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from cameras and LiDAR, employs a temporal smoother for improving spatial consistency, and leverages geometric and semantic cues for robust identity re-identification.

Result: FutrTrack achieved strong results, including an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, showcasing significant improvements in reducing identity switches and enhancing tracking accuracy by using multimodal features.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that leveraging multimodal sensor data and transformer-based methods can improve tracking performance, making it competitive with other neural-network-based systems even with limited data and no pretraining.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [109] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Online Label Smoothing (OLS) as a dynamic method to reduce overconfidence and improve accuracy in medical image classification using deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overconfidence issue in deep learning models for medical imaging, which hampers reliability in critical healthcare applications.

Method: OLS dynamically adjusts soft labels during training based on the model's prediction patterns to enhance performance over conventional methods like label smoothing.

Result: OLS improves Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy and provides better feature embeddings compared to other methods such as hard labels and teacher-free knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: OLS enhances both predictive performance and model calibration, making it a viable method for building trustworthy AI in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

TL;DR: The paper presents a detection framework for handling the challenges posed by fisheye cameras in wide-area traffic surveillance, including image distortion and resolution issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by fisheye cameras in traffic surveillance, especially the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution, which affect object detection near image boundaries.

Method: The proposed approach involves a pre- and post-processing pipeline to enhance detection consistency and accuracy. The framework employs ensemble strategies combining outputs from multiple state-of-the-art detection models trained specifically on fisheye imagery.

Result: The method achieved an F1 score of 0.6366 and secured 8th place out of 62 teams in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the challenges of fisheye imagery, demonstrating robustness in detecting objects in regions with severe distortion, making it a promising approach for traffic surveillance applications.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [111] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time filtering method to address visual noise in 3DGS models when viewing from positions outside the training data distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve substantial visual noise caused by the lack of training data in extrapolated regions when viewing 3DGS models.

Method: A real-time render-aware filtering method that uses sensitivity scores derived from intermediate gradients to address uncertainties caused by anisotropic orientations.

Result: The proposed method improves visual quality, realism, and consistency, integrating seamlessly into 3DGS rendering pipelines without the need for extensive retraining.

Conclusion: The filtering method effectively mitigates generative uncertainty, enabling high visual fidelity in 3D reconstruction systems even at extrapolated viewpoints.

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [112] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of ultrasound brain imaging by introducing BrainPuzzle, a hybrid framework that integrates physical modeling and machine learning to accurately reconstruct speed-of-sound (SoS) brain maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle difficulties in ultrasound brain imaging caused by skull-induced sound speed differences, weak signals, and incomplete spatial coverage, which hinder quantitative imaging.

Method: The proposed approach, BrainPuzzle, combines reverse time migration from physics-based modeling and a transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-attention unit to reconstruct accurate SoS maps using multi-angle ultrasound acquisitions.

Result: BrainPuzzle demonstrated superior reconstruction accuracy and image completeness for SoS maps compared to traditional methods, using two synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: This study shows that BrainPuzzle effectively advances quantitative transcranial ultrasound imaging with improved feasibility and performance, especially under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates cultural bias in generative image models by examining both text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) systems across countries and eras. It highlights how existing systems are culturally insensitive and provides a reproducible benchmark for further studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexploration of cultural bias in image-to-image (I2I) generative editing systems, which have real-world implications for diverse cultural representations.

Method: The study adopts a unified evaluation across six countries using a cultural schema and era-aware prompts, combining automatic metrics, a culture-aware VQA, and expert human judgments. Data, prompts, and configurations are made publicly available for reproducibility.

Result: Key findings include: (1) global models default to Global-North depictions, minimizing cross-cultural distinctions, (2) iterative I2I editing weakens cultural fidelity regardless of conventional metrics, and (3) I2I models commonly use superficial changes that fail to reflect authentic cultural contexts.

Conclusion: Generative image models have significant cultural biases that affect their reliability in producing culture-sensitive edits. The provided benchmark serves as a tool for diagnosing and improving these biases in generative systems.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [114] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIBAR, a filter-based asynchronous method for reconstructing intensity images from event camera data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing intensity images from event cameras often rely on neural networks, requiring substantial computational power from GPUs. This paper aims to develop a simpler, more accessible solution suitable for CPUs.

Method: FIBAR employs a temporal digital IIR filter to integrate intensity changes. To reduce noise, it uses a novel algorithm for detecting stale pixels and applies Gaussian blurring to them based on assumptions about gradient behavior in the absence of events.

Result: The method achieves a processing speed of 42 million events/s (140 million events/s without spatial filtering) on a modern laptop CPU. While the reconstructions are noisier and exhibit ghost images compared to neural network methods, they are effective for specific tasks, such as fiducial marker detection.

Conclusion: FIBAR offers a CPU-based, efficient alternative for tasks requiring event camera image reconstruction, balancing simplicity, speed, and application-specific performance.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TBTLRR, a robust tensor-based model for effective image clustering, addressing limitations of existing methods through adaptive tensor norms and efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor low-rank representation methods for image clustering are often static and susceptible to noise, leading to lower performance in real-world scenarios.

Method: The proposed TBTLRR model incorporates data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm using learned unitary transforms, bilateral structure for local correlations, and mixed regularization techniques for handling complex noise.

Result: The TBTLRR model outperformed state-of-the-art clustering methods in extensive experiments, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: TBTLRR provides a robust, adaptive solution for image clustering, leveraging both global and local correlations while effectively managing noise.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Endoshare, a cross-platform tool for standardizing and de-identifying surgical videos, aimed at addressing privacy concerns and enhancing usability. It was developed using a user-centered approach and showed high usability scores in testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in the widespread adoption of video-based surgical data science due to heterogeneous formats and privacy issues.

Method: A user-centered iterative approach was used, involving surveys of clinicians and computer scientists based on usability heuristics, privacy-by-design architecture, and testing with clinicians using acceptance model constructs.

Result: Endoshare demonstrated high usability and user acceptance through surveys. Processing times were affected by mode, video duration, and computational power. Broad compliance certification and validation are necessary before widespread deployment.

Conclusion: Endoshare is a promising tool for standardized and privacy-preserving surgical video management, but further validation and certification are required to position it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [117] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attentive Convolution (ATConv), a method to reformulate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by integrating principles of self-attention such as adaptive routing and lateral inhibition, leading to significant performance improvements over traditional self-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms and bridge the performance gap in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while leveraging the advantages of both approaches.

Method: The paper identifies two key principles of self-attention: adaptive routing and lateral inhibition, and integrates these into a newly proposed convolutional operator, Attentive Convolution (ATConv).

Result: The proposed ATConv achieves superior performance in vision tasks and efficient sampling in image generation. For example, it attains 84.4% ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters and improves diffusion-based image generation metrics.

Conclusion: Attentive Convolution (ATConv) successfully bridges the performance gap between traditional Convolution and Self-Attention, introducing a hybrid approach that combines high efficiency with enhanced expressivity for practical applications in computer vision.

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableSketcher enhances diffusion models for generating hand-drawn sketches with improved alignment to prompts using fine-tuned components and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, which represent abstract expression, and improve generation quality.

Method: The framework employs fine-tuned variational autoencoder for latent decoding optimized for sketches, combined with reinforcement learning using a novel visual question answering reward function.

Result: StableSketcher produces sketches with higher stylistic fidelity and better prompt alignment compared to Stable Diffusion baseline.

Conclusion: StableSketcher advances sketch generation by demonstrating superior results. The introduction of SketchDUO dataset enhances research in this domain, with plans for public release of both resources.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

*Ziheng Zhang,Xinyue Ma,Arpita Chowdhury,Elizabeth G. Campolongo,Matthew J. Thompson,Net Zhang,Samuel Stevens,Hilmar Lapp,Tanya Berger-Wolf,Yu Su,Wei-Lun Chao,Jianyang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of descriptive captions for biological multimodal foundation models, leveraging synthetic captions to enhance their training and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological multimodal models require improved alignment between images and biological traits, but the lack of instance-specific descriptive captions limits the utility of natural language supervision in organismal biology.

Method: Synthetic captions are generated using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by Wikipedia-based visual information and taxon-specific formats. These captions are used to train BIOCAP, a biological foundation model.

Result: BIOCAP demonstrates strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval, capturing rich biological semantics.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions are effective in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models, proving useful beyond simple labels.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

### [121] [Inverse Image-Based Rendering for Light Field Generation from Single Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20132)
*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach for light field synthesis using only single images, overcoming limitations in traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current light field generation methods are costly and require specialized devices such as microlens arrays or complex camera setups. The paper aims to simplify the process and expand the accessibility of light field creation.

Method: The presented neural rendering pipeline predicts light flows by learning relationships among source image rays through cross-attention, generating novel views iteratively while maintaining occlusion consistency.

Result: The proposed method operates effectively on diverse challenging datasets without retraining, proving superior to state-of-the-art view synthesis techniques.

Conclusion: Inverse image-based rendering provides a viable and innovative approach for light field generation using single images, offering flexibility and outperforming other techniques.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

*Jiachen Liang,Ruibing Hou,Minyang Hu,Hong Chang,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LogitGap, a post-hoc method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, leveraging logit space relationships to enhance OOD separability and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underutilization of logit space information in post-hoc OOD detection methods, improving model reliability in open-world applications.

Method: The authors propose LogitGap, which utilizes the gap between the maximum logit and remaining logits, and further refines the approach by identifying the most informative subset of logits using a training-free strategy.

Result: LogitGap shows state-of-the-art performance in diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks, validated by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: LogitGap is an effective, efficient, and practical OOD detection method that significantly improves separability between ID and OOD samples by leveraging logit relationships.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PartNeXt, a large-scale 3D dataset with over 23,000 textured and annotated 3D models. It demonstrates advantages over prior datasets in tasks such as part segmentation and part-centric question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in existing 3D datasets, such as reliance on untextured geometries and non-scalable expert-dependent annotations, to advance research in computer vision, graphics, and robotics.

Method: The authors created the PartNeXt dataset including 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models with fine-grained, hierarchical annotations in 50 categories. They benchmarked it across key tasks such as class-agnostic part segmentation and 3D part-centric question answering.

Result: State-of-the-art methods struggle with fine-grained details on this dataset. However, training on PartNeXt provides significant improvements, showcasing its quality and utility.

Conclusion: PartNeXt addresses critical challenges in structured 3D understanding by providing a scalable, high-quality, and textured dataset. Its launch enables further advancements in tasks like segmentation and 3D question answering.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

### [124] [Monocular Visual 8D Pose Estimation for Articulated Bicycles and Cyclists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20158)
*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for estimating an 8D pose of articulated bicycles and cyclists from a single RGB image, improving accuracy with two additional parameters for steering and pedal rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating the pose of cyclists is critical for autonomous driving systems to classify crossing intentions, predict behavior, and avoid collisions.

Method: The authors propose a model that jointly estimates 8D pose and 3D keypoints of articulated bicycles using synthetic and real image data for training. It incorporates rotations of steering handles and pedals along with standard 6D pose parameters.

Result: The method achieves competitive scores in 8D pose estimation compared to state-of-the-art category-level 6D estimators, showing promising results on real images.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the understanding of bicycle pose and travel direction, contributing to improved safety measures for vulnerable road users in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an approach for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) that utilizes multimodal knowledge updating and adaptive prototype adjustment to address distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the performance degradation in CZSL caused by the distribution shift at test time due to the inclusion of unseen attribute-object compositions.

Method: The proposed method incorporates multimodal prototype updates from unsupervised data, adaptive adjustment weights, a dynamic priority queue for visual knowledge retrieval, and multimodal collaborative representation learning for semantic alignment.

Result: The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets, outperforming existing approaches under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: The presented approach effectively mitigates distribution shift issues in CZSL by leveraging comprehensive multimodal knowledge, adaptive prototype adjustments, and collaborative learning frameworks. The results confirm its superiority in accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed IB-GAN utilizes the Information Bottleneck framework for GAN optimization, achieving competitive disentanglement and superior sample quality compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance GAN-based models for disentangled representation learning by integrating the Information Bottleneck framework.

Method: Introduced IB-GAN, which incorporates a learnable latent distribution via an intermediate stochastic layer in the generator for mutual information constraint.

Result: IB-GAN demonstrates competitive disentanglement, surpasses InfoGAN, and often generates higher visual quality samples compared to {eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN.

Conclusion: IB-GAN represents a significant improvement in both disentanglement and generation quality, outperforming its contemporaries.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

*Yun Wang,Junjie Hu,Qiaole Dong,Yongjian Zhang,Yanwei Fu,Tin Lun Lam,Dapeng Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPMStereo introduces a memory buffer for enhanced spatio-temporal depth estimation from stereo videos, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of achieving temporally consistent depth estimation for stereo video, crucial for applications like augmented reality, while overcoming computational inefficiencies.

Method: PPMStereo proposes a Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module with two stages: a 'pick' process for selecting relevant frames and a 'play' process for adaptive weighting, both aimed at efficient spatio-temporal aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PPMStereo achieves competitive accuracy and temporal consistency, with significant performance gains over previous methods and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: PPMStereo successfully balances accuracy, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, making it a notable advancement for dynamic stereo matching systems.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a protocol to evaluate the ability of video generation models to simulate multi-agent pedestrian dynamics, revealing strengths and areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the plausibility of multi-agent interactions in generated videos, as existing benchmarks fail to assess realistic pedestrian dynamics.

Method: Created evaluation protocols for text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models with a 2D trajectory reconstruction method from pixel data.

Result: Models exhibited effective priors for multi-agent behavior but showed issues such as merging or disappearing individuals.

Conclusion: Current models demonstrate promising realism in simulating multi-agent dynamics; further development is needed to address observed failure modes.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) for video surveillance by proposing a model, SPAN, to analyze continuous suspicion progression instead of discrete classification, showing improved monitoring and intervention capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying suspicious intentions in video surveillance use discrete classification, which fails to capture the continuous progression of suspicious intentions, undermining early detection and explainability.

Method: Introduces the SPAN model that employs continuous regression and incorporates long-term dependencies, cumulative effects using TPP theory, a suspicion score formula, Suspicion Coefficient Modulation for multimodal adjustments, and the Concept-Anchored Mapping method for insights into potential behavioral intentions.

Result: Extensive experiments conducted on the HAI dataset showed that SPAN reduced MSE by 19.8%, improved average mAP by 1.78%, and exhibited significant performance in low-frequency cases, with a 2.74% mAP gain.

Conclusion: SPAN effectively enhances early detection, explainability, and proactive intervention in video surveillance systems, offering a superior alternative to discrete classification models for security monitoring.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates 54 public brain MRI datasets to analyze variability influencing foundation model development for brain MRI, showing significant inconsistencies at multiple levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address gaps in understanding the variability and consistency in publicly available brain MRI datasets, which are essential for developing robust foundation models.

Method: The study systematically analyzes dataset-level and image-level characteristics, assesses preprocessing variability, and employs a feature-space evaluation using a 3D DenseNet121 model to quantify inter-dataset bias.

Result: The analysis reveals strong imbalances in dataset composition, substantial heterogeneity in voxel-level properties, variability in preprocessing effects, and persistent inter-dataset bias despite harmonization efforts.

Conclusion: To develop generalizable brain MRI foundation models, researchers must employ preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies due to variabilities and biases present in available public datasets.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPO++ enhances text-to-video generation quality by optimizing user-provided prompts through a model-agnostic framework without modifying the generative backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video models are often limited in generative potential due to short, misaligned prompts provided by users which don't conform to training data distributions.

Method: RAPO++ consists of a cross-stage framework: Stage 1 enhances prompts via retrieval-augmented refinement, Stage 2 iteratively optimizes sample-specific prompts using feedback mechanisms, and Stage 3 uses these optimized prompts to fine-tune a large language model for pre-inference efficiency.

Result: Experiments reveal that RAPO++ outperforms existing methods, yielding improvements in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: RAPO++ proves to be a scalable, cost-efficient, and model-agnostic solution for improving prompt optimization in text-to-video generation, setting a new performance standard.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts

temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing

### [132] [FlowCycle: Pursuing Cycle-Consistent Flows for Text-based Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20212)
*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowCycle, a novel text-based image editing framework leveraging target-aware intermediate states for enhanced editability and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image editing methods face challenges with semantic gaps and inconsistencies when modifications deviate significantly from the source image.

Method: The proposed FlowCycle framework uses learnable noises and a cycle-consistent process to iteratively corrupt editing-relevant contents and preserve editing-irrelevant ones, creating target-aware intermediate states.

Result: FlowCycle demonstrated superior image editing quality and consistency compared to state-of-the-art approaches through extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: FlowCycle enhances text-based image editing by effectively addressing semantic gaps and improving both editability and consistency through its target-aware framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning approach called CURL for accurate fetal movement detection from ultrasound videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and objectivity in fetal movement detection, addressing limitations of traditional methods like maternal perception and cardiotocography.

Method: Developed the Contrastive Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL) framework, utilizing spatial and temporal contrastive learning and a task-specific sampling strategy for training and probabilistic fine-tuning for inference.

Result: When tested on a dataset with 92 subjects, CURL achieved 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC, demonstrating its effective performance in fetal movement detection.

Conclusion: CURL, with its novel approach, shows promise for enhancing prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making by providing reliable and objective fetal movement analysis.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "EditInfinity," a model that adapts a VQ-based generative architecture for precise text-driven image editing by minimizing inversion errors seen in diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based image editing methods face limitations due to approximation errors introduced during image inversion, which lack exact supervision. Addressing this issue, the paper aims to enhance image editing performance.

Method: The proposed "EditInfinity" adapts the binary-quantized generative model "Infinity." It introduces mechanisms for text prompting rectification, image style preservation during precise inversion, and a holistic smoothing strategy for high-fidelity and semantic alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate EditInfinity's superior performance in text-guided image editing tasks compared to leading diffusion-based approaches on the PIE-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: EditInfinity provides an efficient and effective solution to image editing using VQ-based generative models, displaying improved fidelity and semantic precision compared to current state-of-the-art techniques. The method minimizes inversion errors, offering greater editing accuracy.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [136] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates hallucination issues in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in longer responses, proposes a framework to mitigate such hallucinations, and provides fresh insights on the role of context in causing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that LVLMs often hallucinate in longer, free-form responses, raising questions about the underlying mechanisms behind hallucinations.

Method: The authors introduce an "induce-detect-suppress" framework that induces hallucinations with intentionally designed contexts, detects high-risk cases early, and suppresses object-level hallucinations during decoding.

Result: The proposed framework consistently and significantly improves benchmarks in mitigating hallucinations while validating the hypothesis that context reliance contributes to hallucination risks.

Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework, provides insights into the role of context in hallucinations, and sets the stage for further exploration of hallucination-related issues within LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Result: EmbodiedBrain surpasses existing models in all metrics, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, validated through a comprehensive evaluation system.

Conclusion: EmbodiedBrain paves the way for generalist embodied agents, addressing major limitations in embodied AI, and provides open-source resources for further development.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces COS3D, an open-vocabulary 3D segmentation framework that integrates language and segmentation cues effectively, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation requires integration of segmentation and language understanding but existing methods face challenges like reliance on a single 3D language field or pre-computed segmentations prone to errors.

Method: The paper presents COS3D, utilizing a collaborative prompt-segmentation approach and introducing a collaborative field (instance field + language field). The key methods include instance-to-language feature mapping, a two-stage training strategy, and an adaptive prompt refinement for inference.

Result: COS3D achieves superior performance on widely-used benchmarks compared to existing approaches. It also proves effective for additional applications like novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

Conclusion: COS3D effectively addresses key limitations in open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, demonstrating its capability in both performance and broader applicability.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper presents ALICE-LRI, a method for generating lossless range images from spinning LiDAR sensors without manufacturer data, significantly preserving point cloud information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LiDAR projection methods often cause geometric inconsistencies and irreversible data loss, which compromise high-fidelity applications needed in autonomous navigation and precision mapping.

Method: The ALICE-LRI algorithm reverse-engineers spinning LiDAR sensors' intrinsic geometry, inferring parameters like laser beam configuration and angular distribution to enable lossless range image projections and point cloud reconstruction.

Result: The approach maintains zero point loss across all clouds tested on KITTI and DurLAR datasets, achieving geometric accuracy within sensor precision limits and demonstrating real-time performance.

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI advances LiDAR data processing by enabling lossless projections, improving geometric accuracy, and offering practical downstream benefits for high-precision applications.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

*Minseok Kang,Minhyeok Lee,Minjung Kim,Donghyeong Kim,Sangyoun Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualGround is a new model for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) that improves on moment retrieval and highlight detection by disentangling global and local semantic roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTG models overly rely on global semantics ([EOS] token) and fail to leverage fine-grained, word-level signals, leading to limited temporal alignment accuracy.

Method: The proposed DualGround model introduces a dual-branch architecture with token-role-aware cross-modal interaction strategies. It separates global ([EOS]) and local (word and phrase-level) semantics for context-aware video grounding, improving both sentence and phrase-level alignment.

Result: DualGround achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Disentangling semantic roles for video-language alignment through the DualGround model enhances temporal grounding, advancing VTG methods for improved performance.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

*Shuhan Hu,Yiru Li,Yuanyuan Li,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method to improve cross-view object geo-localization using a mask-based positional encoding scheme and contextual modeling, improving localization performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-view geo-localization suffer from reliance on keypoint-based positional encoding, which only captures 2D coordinates and ignores object shape, leading to annotation sensitivity and weaker cross-view matching.

Method: The proposed approach introduces a mask-based positional encoding (MPE) method that encodes spatial coordinates and object shapes through segmentation masks. It also includes a Context Enhancement Module (CEM) leveraging strip convolutional kernels for better feature extraction of elongated objects.

Result: The EDGeo model achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building), showing a 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under ground-to-satellite scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper provides an advanced paradigm for positional encoding and feature contextualization, significantly advancing cross-view geo-localization research and practical applications.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model named Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC) for improving Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER), addressing issues with semantic inconsistencies and text modality dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in MER such as semantic inconsistencies across modalities and the dominance of text modality affecting recognition accuracy.

Method: The CMC model includes a Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) for self-supervised unimodal pretraining, a Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM), and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for multimodal finetuning.

Result: CMC shows equal or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across four datasets, with significant advantages in handling semantic inconsistencies.

Conclusion: CMC effectively mitigates challenges in MER, achieving reliable fusion and balanced modality integration, showcasing strong performance across datasets and public availability of its implementation.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

*Guangyu Dai,Dong Chen,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses video anomaly detection by introducing a refined multi-modal feature method called GMFVAD. It enhances visual features using text captions and reduces redundancy, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video anomaly detection often fail to account for redundant information in visual features, leading to suboptimal results. The authors aim to address this gap by refining feature extraction using multi-modal diversity.

Method: The paper proposes GMFVAD, which creates grained multi-modal features by highlighting video snippets’ main content and utilizing text captions to complement visual features, effectively reducing redundancy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GMFVAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets. Ablation experiments confirm that the reductions in redundant information lead to improved accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed GMFVAD approach refines multi-modal information for video anomaly detection, achieving improved accuracy and addressing the challenge of redundant information in visual features.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual

TL;DR: The paper addresses biases in Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) datasets and proposes new datasets (VCR-OOD) to evaluate model generalization while introducing a bias-reduction technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the problem of bias in Visual Commonsense Reasoning datasets, which can lead to prediction shortcuts and hinder model robustness.

Method: They introduce VCR-OOD datasets to assess model generalization, analyze causal graphs to identify biases, and employ a backdoor adjustment method with a dictionary of correct answers for debiasing.

Result: The proposed debiasing approaches demonstrate improved performance and reduced bias across tested datasets.

Conclusion: Addressing and mitigating bias in VCR datasets enhances the robustness and generalization of visual question answering models.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

*Haodong Yang,Zhongling Huang,Shaojie Guo,Zhe Zhang,Gong Cheng,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles challenges in recognition of CV-SAR images, introducing Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), which excels in generalization, interpretability, and efficiency under limited data and domain-shift conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the representation trilemma (generalization, interpretability, and efficient modeling) in CV-SAR image recognition, leveraging electromagnetic scattering features inadequately utilized by conventional models.

Method: The method involves the development of KINN, featuring a "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture incorporating physics-guided priors, aggregation modules, and semantic compression, deployed in CNN and Vision Transformer variants.

Result: The proposed KINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR image recognition benchmarks, showing strong parameter efficiency, generalization, and interpretability even with limited data.

Conclusion: KINN offers a practical solution to CV-SAR representation challenges while providing an avenue for trustworthy AI implementation in SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of Egocentric VideoQA by introducing the DMC³ framework that leverages counterfactual samples and contrastive optimization to enhance task performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Egocentric VideoQA, particularly challenges inherent to first-person perspectives like understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions.

Method: The proposed DMC³ framework includes: 1) generating textual and visual counterfactual positive and negative samples, 2) incorporating these samples into a VideoQA baseline, and 3) applying a contrastive loss to fine-tune the system with the counterfactual samples.

Result: The DMC³ framework demonstrated superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results: 52.51% and 46.04% on the normal and indirect splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% performance on QAEGO4D.

Conclusion: The DMC³ framework effectively addresses unique challenges in Egocentric VideoQA by incorporating counterfactual construction and contrastive optimization, setting new benchmarks for the task.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel paradigm, 'Instruction-as-Reasoning,' for GUI grounding by creating diverse and dynamic instructions to significantly improve performance, with their models achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address flaws in current GUI grounding datasets and methods which treat instructions statically, thereby overlooking their diversity and quality. The authors aim to improve grounding performance by exploiting instruction diversity and treating instructions dynamically.

Method: The paper proposes 'Instruction-as-Reasoning' with a two-stage training framework: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on diverse, synthesized instructions for multi-perspective reasoning, and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing instruction pathway selection and composition.

Result: The models developed, UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B, achieved state-of-the-art results on five grounding benchmarks. Specifically, UI-Ins-32B scored 87.3% accuracy on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Additionally, UI-Ins-7B showcased a 74.1% success rate in AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: The proposed method dynamically improves GUI grounding performance by leveraging diverse instructions through reasoning, mitigating flaws in traditional approaches and enhancing user-agent interactions. The research also demonstrates successful integration of SFT and RL methodologies.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in cross-modal geo-localization, mitigating severe inter-platform heterogeneity and bridging domain gaps between training data and test queries.

Result: The method achieves top performance on the official leaderboard for the task, demonstrating robust cross-modal geo-localization capabilities.

Conclusion: By creatively combining text and image frameworks with preprocessing and training optimizations, the proposed system effectively handles heterogeneity and domain gaps in multi-platform geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language
query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap
between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite
augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

*Zelin Peng,Zhengqin Xu,Qingyang Liu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperET, a training paradigm for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that uses hyperbolic space for more efficient visual-textual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs require extensive computational resources for training due to inefficient vision encoders like CLIP and SAM, which lack language alignment at multi-granularity levels.

Method: HyperET employs hyperbolic space for hierarchical modeling and utilizes learnable matrices with Möbius multiplication to dynamically optimize visual-textual representations at various granularity levels.

Result: HyperET improves pre-training and fine-tuning performance of MLLMs across benchmarks with less than 1% additional parameters.

Conclusion: HyperET offers a scalable and efficient approach for multi-granularity visual-textual alignment, addressing inefficiencies in existing MLLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnyPcc, a universal framework for improving point cloud geometry compression by leveraging robust context models and addressing out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current challenges in point cloud geometry compression arise from a lack of robust context models and inefficient processing of out-of-distribution data.

Method: The paper proposes AnyPcc, which employs a Universal Context Model for robust dependency capture and an Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy to optimize handling of out-of-distribution data.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show AnyPcc achieves the state-of-the-art performance in point cloud compression.

Conclusion: AnyPcc effectively improves point cloud compression via innovative context modeling and adaptation strategies, setting a benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AccuQuant, a novel method for post-training quantization (PTQ) in diffusion models that addresses the error accumulation problem during denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the quantization errors in diffusion models that accumulate during the multi-step denoising process.

Method: AccuQuant explicitly simulates multiple denoising steps instead of minimizing discrepancies independently for each step. It introduces efficient implementation techniques and a novel objective to reduce memory complexity.

Result: AccuQuant is shown to be effective and efficient across various tasks and diffusion models, demonstrated on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: AccuQuant provides a significant improvement over prior methods in handling quantization errors for diffusion models, with reduced memory requirements and enhanced efficiency.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper examines Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in visual generation and introduces Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field) to extend spatial and temporal inductive biases in 3D geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs leverage Transformer scalability in visual generation but rely on positional encodings for spatial coherence. The study investigates improving spatial understanding.

Method: Researchers proposed PE-Field, which extends positional encodings to a structured 3D field, enabling tools for depth-aware volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for refined control.

Result: PE-Field enhanced DiTs show state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and generalize well to spatial image editing applications.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that PE-Field improves 3D geometry modeling and adapts DiTs to specialized tasks like spatial image editing and novel view synthesis, enhancing visual generation capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges in image-to-recipe retrieval by proposing a causal method to predict unseen culinary details from food images for improved representation learning and retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current image-to-recipe retrieval methods, which overlook subtle recipe-specific details and are heavily influenced by visual dominance and biases when integrating images and textual recipes, especially across mixed cuisines.

Method: The paper introduces a novel causal representation learning approach that predicts crucial but visually overlooked culinary elements from food images. These elements are explicitly integrated into the cross-modal representation learning process to reduce biases.

Result: The proposed approach was tested on the monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural dataset. Results demonstrated improved performance in uncovering subtle culinary details and enhancing retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The introduced causal representation learning method effectively addresses challenges in image-to-recipe retrieval by mitigating visual biases and successfully identifying critical, less-apparent features, making it suitable for both monolingual and multilingual applications.

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

TL;DR: The study introduces FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet, a novel model for lung cancer classification using dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty and complexity in lung cancer diagnosis and improve the accuracy of classification by leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation.

Method: The approach dynamically adjusts distillation weights using fuzzy logic, employs ViT-B32 as instructor and MobileNet as the student model, improves image quality with fusion techniques, and optimizes student model selection using Genetic Algorithm.

Result: The model achieved 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathological images and 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images, showcasing its effectiveness across different imaging domains.

Conclusion: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet proves to be a robust model for lung cancer classification with high accuracy and capability to handle varying uncertainties in medical imaging.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan presents a novel solution to multi-step video reasoning challenges by utilizing evidence-grounded approaches, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need to improve multi-step reasoning in multimodal large language models, due to challenges with ungrounded conclusions and inaccurate evidence localization in video data.

Method: The paper introduces Conan-91K, a dataset for reasoning tasks, and a multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with an AIR RLVR training framework to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Result: Conan surpasses a baseline model, achieving over 10% higher accuracy on reasoning benchmarks and demonstrating strong scalability and robustness in long-video tasks.

Conclusion: Conan is an effective framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning, offering significant improvement and generalization in understanding complex visual data.

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

It proposes a modular transfer learning pipeline and introduces a robustness metric for evaluation. Results show enhanced performance, especially in ethnicity inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness auditing in face analysis systems is dependent on the reliability of demographic attribute inference, which often depends on predefined demographic segmentation. Improving DAI reliability is essential to reduce biases and improve fairness assessment.

Method: The paper proposes a reproducible DAI pipeline based on modular transfer learning. It combines pretrained face recognition encoders with nonlinear classification heads and evaluates performance against accuracy, fairness, and robustness metrics. Robustness is introduced as a new metric measuring intra-identity consistency.

Result: The proposed pipeline outperforms existing baselines, particularly for ethnicity inference, which is a more challenging demographic attribute.

Conclusion: The paper offers a reliable, transparent method for demographic inference in fairness auditing, supported by a robust pipeline and publicly available resources.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EchoDistill, a method to enhance one-step text-to-image diffusion models for personalization, using bidirectional distillation of concepts between teacher and student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-step diffusion models struggle with effectively personalizing novel concepts, limiting their ability to synthesize high-quality, personalized images efficiently.

Method: EchoDistill employs bidirectional concept distillation between teacher and student models while sharing a text encoder. The student model is optimized with adversarial losses and alignment losses, along with bidirectional echoing feedback from the student to the teacher.

Result: The proposed EchoDistill framework improves the personalization capabilities of one-step diffusion models and enhances the generative quality of both student and teacher models.

Conclusion: EchoDistill establishes a new paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models, outperforming existing methods in the one-step diffusion personalization setup.

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

*Xiaohan Lan,Fanfan Liu,Haibo Qiu,Siqi Yang,Delian Ruan,Peng Shi,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Metis-HOME, a multimodal reasoning framework that improves efficiency and general capabilities by dynamically choosing between complex reasoning and rapid inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in multimodal reasoning models, including inefficiency in handling simple queries and compromised general understanding due to specialized reasoning focus.

Method: Introduced Metis-HOME, a hybrid architecture with two branches for complex reasoning and direct inference, and a dynamic router to allocate tasks effectively.

Result: Enhances complex reasoning abilities and improves general understanding capabilities, outperforming other reasoning-specialized models.

Conclusion: Metis-HOME balances reasoning efficiency and generalization, offering a novel paradigm for optimizing multimodal large reasoning models.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

*Lixiong Qin,Yang Zhang,Mei Wang,Jiani Hu,Weihong Deng,Weiran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa) framework to enhance Explainable DeepFake Analysis by enabling fine-grained, multimodal text and image analyses of facial artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models for Explainable DeepFake Analysis lack fine-grained awareness, making artifact descriptions coarse and unreliable while failing to connect forgery explanations with corresponding visual evidence of facial context.

Method: The paper introduces the Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) for fine-grained facial image annotation, a FiFa-Annotator for reliable data annotation, a new Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, and a unified multi-task learning model (FiFa-MLLM) capable of handling multimodal inputs/outputs.

Result: FiFa-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on existing Explainable DeepFake Analysis datasets and improves upon strong baselines in the proposed AGE task.

Conclusion: By introducing fine-grained regional concepts, robust annotation tools, and multimodal learning architectures, the FiFa framework improves the accuracy and detail of DeepFake analysis, bridging gaps in previous XDFA approaches.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

*Guillermo Carbajal,Andrés Almansa,Pablo Musé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework for motion deblurring by estimating both the sharp image and camera motion using a Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of restoring images affected by severe motion blur, especially under large or rotational movements, which remains difficult in image restoration.

Method: Develop a modular deep learning framework using a Projective Motion Blur Model implemented with a differentiable blur module. It uses neural networks to predict 3D rotation trajectories and guides restoration through model-based architecture.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real datasets, showcasing particular improvements in addressing severe or spatially variant blur compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides interpretability of camera motion trajectories, enables sequence reconstruction, and enhances deblurring consistency through trajectory optimization, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

*Fuchen Li,Yansong Du,Wenbo Cheng,Xiaoxia Zhou,Sen Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACamera-Net is proposed to address issues of underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency in consumer-grade camera systems, improving image quality under complex lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges posed by complex illumination conditions (e.g., low light, high dynamic range, backlighting) which lead to degraded image quality and performance of vision tasks.

Method: The approach involves designing ACamera-Net, a lightweight network with modules for exposure (ACamera-Exposure) and color (ACamera-Color) adjustments, optimized for real-time edge device usage.

Result: ACamera-Net enhances image quality, stabilizes perception outputs, and outperforms traditional auto and baseline modes by generalizing well across various lighting conditions.

Conclusion: ACamera-Net proves to be an effective solution for dynamic and stable image quality improvement, especially for consumer-grade camera systems, and can be integrated seamlessly into imaging pipelines.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open-o3 Video, a model integrating spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video reasoning models lack precise identification of when and where key evidence appears during dynamic scenes.

Method: Open-o3 Video incorporates explicit spatio-temporal evidence, utilizes novel training datasets with annotations, and applies a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple reward functions.

Result: Open-o3 Video shows significant improvements in reasoning accuracy and spatio-temporal alignment, outperforming existing baselines on multiple video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video enables more reliable and interpretable video reasoning by grounding answers in concrete visual observations, advancing the field of evidence-centered video understanding.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenColorBench, a benchmark targeting the previously underexplored area of fine-grained color precision in text-to-image generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highlight the limitations of current text-to-image generation models in accurately rendering colors specified via textual prompts. Color precision is critical for visual perception and applications like art and brand design.

Method: Developed the GenColorBench benchmark with 44,000 color-focused prompts based on standardized color systems, conducting perceptual and automated assessments of current models.

Result: Evaluations using GenColorBench exposed variations among models in handling color conventions and identified areas of failure.

Conclusion: GenColorBench offers a systematic way to evaluate and improve text-to-image models' ability to precisely generate colors, beneficial for creative and design workflows.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework using similarity-based prototypes for cross-modality segmentation, addressing domain shift issues in deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate performance degradation of deep learning models caused by domain shifts and eliminate costly annotation for unseen domains in unsupervised domain adaptation.

Method: Class-wise prototypes are learned in embedding spaces, followed by a similarity constraint ensuring representation and separability. Dictionaries to store prototypes are leveraged for contrastive learning and addressing class-missing issues.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Similarity-based prototype learning significantly enhances cross-modality segmentation, proving effective in reducing domain gaps.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OnlineSplatter, a feed-forward framework for high-quality 3D object reconstruction from monocular video without requiring pose or depth information, maintaining computational efficiency and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing free-moving objects from monocular video, especially in cases without reliable pose or depth information and under arbitrary object motions.

Method: The proposed method, OnlineSplatter, starts with anchoring reconstruction using the first frame and progressively improves the representation of the object through a dense Gaussian primitive field. A dual-key memory module is used, combining latent appearance-geometry keys and explicit directional keys, to fuse frame features with aggregated object states. This enables spatial-guided memory readout and efficient computation.

Result: OnlineSplatter achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction techniques, performs well even with increasing observations, and maintains consistent memory and runtime efficiency.

Conclusion: OnlineSplatter advances free-moving object reconstruction by delivering high-quality results without requiring prior pose or depth information, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

*Yuan Sheng,Yanbin Hao,Chenxu Li,Shuo Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeViCES, a framework designed to enhance long video understanding, improving accuracy and robustness by selecting frames based on semantic-visual consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in long video understanding caused by complex, diverse, and scattered content. Existing Video-LLMs are not efficient and often yield inconsistent reasoning when applied to long video sequences. Current approaches don't fully account for temporal dependencies or integrate multimodal evidence.

Method: SeViCES introduces two key modules: (1) A Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module that selects frames using a temporal-aware semantic branch for captions and a cluster-guided visual branch to align embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. (2) An Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) module to resolve inconsistencies in predictions and constrain the answer space through evidence fusion.

Result: The SeViCES framework exhibits superior accuracy and robustness in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets for long video understanding.

Conclusion: Consensus-driven evidence selection is crucial for advancing Video-LLMs, and SeViCES offers an effective training-free, model-agnostic solution to the challenges of long video understanding.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of dental images poses challenges due to low contrast, artifacts, angle variations, and clinician subjectivity. Automating this process through AI could improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: The paper systematically reviews 260 studies, analyzes 49 publicly available datasets, categorizes DL models for different DIA tasks, explains training methods, and performance evaluation metrics.

Result: Deep learning-based methods are promising for addressing the challenges in dental image analysis, with significant progress in datasets and model development highlighted.

Conclusion: Deep learning plays a transformative role in dental image analysis, providing efficient and accurate solutions. Current challenges and future research directions are proposed in the paper for continued improvement.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: BTB3D introduces a new approach for vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging, vastly improving diagnostic tasks like report generation and text-to-CT synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging struggle with high-resolution and long-sequence volumes due to misalignment of vision encoders with clinical language and loss of fine anatomy from slice-wise tokenization.

Method: The authors developed BTB3D, a causal convolutional encoder-decoder incorporating a three-stage training curriculum for more efficient tokenization of medical imaging data, allowing processing of large scan volumes without memory overhead.

Result: BTB3D achieves significant improvements in BLEU scores and clinical F1 for report generation (40% better than previous methods) and enhances text-to-CT synthesis by reducing FID by 75% while halving FVD, yielding anatomically consistent high-resolution volumes.

Conclusion: Precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than just using larger language models, is critical for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

*Chen Zhao,En Ci,Yunzhe Xu,Tiehan Fan,Shanyan Guan,Yanhao Ge,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces UltraHR-100K, a dataset of high-quality ultra-high-resolution images and proposes specialized training strategies for better fine-detail synthesis in such image generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a large-scale high-quality dataset and lack of training strategies for detailed ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation prompted this work.

Method: Introduced UltraHR-100K dataset with >3K resolution images and proposed a frequency-aware post-training method featuring Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS) and Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR).

Result: Improved fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of ultra-high-resolution image generation, as demonstrated by results on the UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and methods address the challenges of fine-detail synthesis and quality enhancement in ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

### [175] [Efficient Multi-bit Quantization Network Training via Weight Bias Correction and Bit-wise Coreset Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20673)
*Jinhee Kim,Jae Jun An,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes techniques to significantly reduce training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models face high training overhead due to repeated full-dataset updates and multiple fine-tuning stages for supporting various precision levels.

Method: The authors introduce weight bias correction for shared batch normalization and elimination of fine-tuning, alongside a bit-wise coreset sampling strategy utilizing gradient-based importance scores for efficient training.

Result: Experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K using ResNet and ViT show the approach achieves competitive or better accuracy with up to a 7.88x reduction in training time.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions effectively minimize training overhead while maintaining or improving accuracy, making multi-bit quantization networks more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with visual hallucinations and over-reliance on textual information, impacting performance on complex visual tasks.

Method: The authors utilize a three-stage evaluation framework to identify failure modes and introduce an agent-based architecture with lightweight visual modules for refined reasoning.

Result: The proposed system achieves substantial improvements on benchmarks (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista) compared to a smaller 7B baseline model.

Conclusion: Integrating specialized visual tools can significantly enhance visual reasoning in MLLMs, and the authors aim to support future research by releasing their framework and evaluation suite.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

### [177] [Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache Compression in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20707)
*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MixKV, a novel method for optimizing key-value (KV) cache compression in large vision-language models (LVLMs), effectively improving storage efficiency and maintaining semantic coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of key-value (KV) caches in large vision-language models creates memory bottlenecks, limiting scalability. Current methods fail to account for modality-specific semantic redundancy in multi-modal KV caches.

Method: The authors proposed MixKV, an approach that combines importance and diversity metrics to reduce KV cache redundancy. It selectively adjusts for semantic redundancy in different attention heads during compression.

Result: MixKV shows consistent improvements over existing methods, achieving an average performance gain of 5.1% across five multi-modal benchmarks under extreme compression, and up to 9.0% gain on GUI grounding tasks, while maintaining inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MixKV provides an effective solution for KV cache compression in LVLMs by incorporating diversity and importance, improving memory efficiency without sacrificing performance across benchmarks and tasks.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

*Jiacheng Chen,Ziyu Jiang,Mingfu Liang,Bingbing Zhuang,Jong-Chyi Su,Sparsh Garg,Ying Wu,Manmohan Chandraker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AutoScape, a framework for generating long driving scene videos using a novel RGB-D diffusion model for consistent and high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in generating long-horizon, geometrically coherent driving scene videos, improving upon limitations of existing methods.

Method: AutoScape utilizes an RGB-D diffusion model to iteratively create sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, conditions generation on previous scene geometry, and interpolates with a video diffusion model for dense outputs.

Result: AutoScape generates realistic driving videos over 20 seconds, significantly improving long-horizon FID and FVD scores compared to prior methods by 48.6% and 43.0%, respectively.

Conclusion: AutoScape advances the state-of-the-art in driving video generation by achieving enhanced geometric and visual consistency over extended timelines.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

*Noam Issachar,Guy Yariv,Sagie Benaim,Yossi Adi,Dani Lischinski,Raanan Fattal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE) enables pre-trained diffusion transformer models to generate ultra-high-resolution images without additional sampling costs, addressing the challenges caused by self-attention scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the cost and inefficiency of training diffusion transformers for ultra-high resolutions due to quadratic scaling of self-attention.

Method: DyPE dynamically adjusts the positional encoding for diffusion transformers based on the current generative progress, leveraging spectral progression inherent in the diffusion process.

Result: DyPE allows the generation of images at ultra-high resolutions, such as 16 million pixels using FLUX, while improving performance benchmarks and achieving state-of-the-art fidelity.

Conclusion: DyPE significantly enhances diffusion transformer models, enabling high-quality image synthesis at ultra-high resolutions, demonstrating its effectiveness especially at higher resolutions.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

*Huijie Zhang,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Willi Menapace,Michael Vasilkovsky,Sergey Tulyakov,Qing Qu,Ivan Skorokhodov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeanFlow framework faces optimization challenges due to conflicting objectives, addressed by introducing α-Flow which improves convergence and generative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore and resolve optimization challenges in the MeanFlow framework to enhance generative modeling performance.

Method: Developed α-Flow formulation, combining trajectory flow matching with a curriculum strategy to address optimization conflicts in MeanFlow.

Result: α-Flow outperforms MeanFlow in generative modeling on ImageNet-1K, with state-of-the-art FID scores.

Conclusion: Adopting α-Flow's unified approach enables better convergence and superior generative results using standard model backbones.

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

*Binbin Huang,Haobin Duan,Yiqun Zhao,Zibo Zhao,Yi Ma,Shenghua Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Cupid', a novel method for 3D reconstruction from a single 2D image, combining camera pose, 3D shape, and texture inference under a generative framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods face challenges in achieving accurate camera pose, shape, and texture estimation simultaneously. This paper aims to address these limitations with a unified generative framework.

Method: Cupid uses a two-stage flow matching pipeline: first, a coarse stage generates 3D geometry and 2D projections for pose recovery; second, a refinement stage enhances details by integrating pose-aligned image features.

Result: Experimental results show Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with over 3 dB PSNR gain and over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while maintaining pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Cupid provides a significant improvement in 3D reconstruction by introducing an effective generative framework that achieves high accuracy, improved visual quality, and robust performance across key metrics.

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multi-Object Tracking system using radar-camera fusion with online calibration of detections, achieving improved tracking precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverages radar's 3D range/depth capabilities alongside camera data to minimize manual input, addressing limitations in current radar underutilization.

Method: Develops a framework combining radar-camera fusion with online calibration, feature matching, and category-consistency checks for enhanced detection association.

Result: Demonstrates improved tracking precision and streamlined sensor mapping through real-world experiments in controlled and traffic environments.

Conclusion: Successfully integrates radar and camera sensor data, proving the method's viability in enhancing MOT efficiency and accuracy. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ARGenSeg, a novel framework for image segmentation based on an AutoRegressive Generation paradigm, integrated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It delivers improved segmentation accuracy and speed by leveraging visual tokens for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods integrating image segmentation with MLLMs often face limitations in capturing detailed visual information due to their use of discrete representations or task-specific decoders. To overcome this, the authors explore a new paradigm for achieving dense mask segmentation and improving pixel-level understanding.

Method: The proposed ARGenSeg framework builds on MLLMs by using visual tokens and a universal VQ-VAE for pixel-level detokenization, enabling segmentation fully dependent on the MLLM’s perception. Additionally, a next-scale-prediction strategy is introduced for efficient parallel token generation.

Result: ARGenSeg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various segmentation datasets, delivering significant improvements in both segmentation accuracy and inference speed, while maintaining robust visual understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: ARGenSeg effectively addresses the challenges faced by previous image segmentation methods in multimodal language models, showcasing a unified and efficient approach for obtaining fine-grained visual segmentation within MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper studies transformer adaptation for autoregressive video prediction by using continuous pixel-space representations, improving both physical simulation accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in causal modeling of physical simulations in video prediction and improve spatiotemporal reasoning, particularly in an unsupervised training setup.

Method: The paper employs a pure transformer-based model with continuous pixel-space representations, spatiotemporal self-attention, and autoregressive video prediction without complex training or latent feature-learning systems.

Result: The proposed approach extends the prediction time horizon for physical simulations by up to 50%, while maintaining comparable performance on standard video quality metrics. Interpretability experiments show generalization to predicting out-of-distribution simulation parameters.

Conclusion: The study highlights the efficacy of a simpler transformer-based framework for video prediction, paving the way for enhanced attention-based spatiotemporal modeling in future works.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents "Speculative Verdict (SV)," a training-free framework for better reasoning over complex, information-intensive visual question answering tasks. SV combines lightweight draft experts with a strong verdict model to enhance accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with reasoning over information-dense images, where textual annotations are interwoven with fine-grained graphics, requiring precise localization and multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Speculative Verdict (SV) uses a two-stage approach: lightweight small VLMs generate diverse reasoning paths as draft experts (draft stage), and a strong VLM synthesizes the paths to produce accurate answers (verdict stage). It includes a consensus expert selection mechanism to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The framework achieves consistent improvements on benchmarks for information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering tasks, such as InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.

Conclusion: Speculative Verdict (SV) is cost-efficient and achieves error correction by synthesizing partly correct reasoning paths, offering an effective alternative to large proprietary models or training-heavy pipelines.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectraMorph, a physics-guided self-supervised framework for hyperspectral super-resolution using hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion. It improves interpretability, robustness, and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of hyperspectral sensors with low spatial resolution by leveraging high-resolution spatial detail from multispectral images, while ensuring interpretability and robust performance, even when the multispectral input has very few bands.

Method: The approach involves a physics-guided self-supervised unmixing bottleneck framework. Endmember signatures are extracted from low-resolution hyperspectral data, with abundance-like maps predicted via a multilayer perceptron, followed by linear mixing for spectral reconstruction, guided by the MSI sensor's response function.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that SpectraMorph outperforms existing unsupervised/self-supervised baselines and is competitive with supervised baselines, achieving superior robustness even with minimal MSI data (e.g., single-band panchromatic).

Conclusion: SpectraMorph is a highly effective framework for hyperspectral super-resolution, offering fast training, enhanced interpretability, and excellent performance across diverse scenarios. It represents a significant advancement over current methods for fusing hyperspectral and multispectral data.

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

### [188] [Towards General Modality Translation with Contrastive and Predictive Latent Diffusion Bridge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20819)
*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM) for general-purpose modality translation, achieving strong performance on diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of extending diffusion models to modality translation tasks, as existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions and lack general application.

Method: The authors propose LDDBM, which operates in a shared latent space using a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. It includes a contrastive alignment loss, a domain-agnostic architecture, predictive loss, and other training strategies.

Result: The proposed method performs well on diverse tasks such as multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis, establishing a strong baseline in modality translation.

Conclusion: LDDBM enables effective and generalizable modality translation without restrictive assumptions and demonstrates success across different types of modality pairs.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer is a user-interactive framework for generating personalized multi-subject images with improved spatial control and subject preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, personalized generative models struggle with spatial composition control and scaling to multiple subjects without losing fidelity.

Method: LayerComposer introduces a layered canvas for assigning subjects to distinct layers, enabling occlusion-free composition, along with a locking mechanism to maintain fidelity of selected layers via positional embeddings and a new data sampling method.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows LayerComposer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial control and maintaining identity fidelity.

Conclusion: LayerComposer provides users with intuitive control over subject placement and resizing without architectural changes, enhancing multi-subject image generation capabilities.

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

*Yihao Meng,Hao Ouyang,Yue Yu,Qiuyu Wang,Wen Wang,Ka Leong Cheng,Hanlin Wang,Yixuan Li,Cheng Chen,Yanhong Zeng,Yujun Shen,Huamin Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine is a text-to-video model that focuses on generating coherent, multi-shot narratives with global consistency, addressing the limitations of traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models fail to create multi-shot, coherent narratives essential for storytelling, focusing mostly on isolated clip generation.

Method: HoloCine uses a Window Cross-Attention mechanism for localized text-to-shot mapping and Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention for efficient minute-scale video creation.

Result: HoloCine demonstrates state-of-the-art narrative coherence and exhibits emergent abilities, including character memory and understanding cinematic techniques.

Conclusion: HoloCine represents a significant progression towards automated filmmaking by enabling the creation of end-to-end cinematic scenes coherently and efficiently.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

### [191] [New Hardness Results for the LOCAL Model via a Simple Self-Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19972)
*Alkida Balliu,Filippo Casagrande,Francesco d'Amore,Dennis Olivetti*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper simplifies and extends the proof techniques from Khoury and Schild's work on the LOCAL model, presenting new hardness results for maximal b-matching and edge coloring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to simplify the highly technical 25-page proof by Khoury and Schild on round elimination via self-reduction, making it more accessible while extending its application to other problems.

Method: The authors provide a streamlined version of the round elimination via self-reduction technique and apply it to derive lower bounds for randomized LOCAL algorithms solving maximal b-matching and edge coloring problems.

Result: The paper establishes new lower bounds for two problems: (1) Maximal b-matching, requiring Ω(min{log_{1+b}Δ, log_Δ n}) and Ω(√log_{1+b} n) rounds, and (2) Edge coloring a graph with Δ + k colors, requiring Ω(min{log Δ, log_Δ n}) and Ω(√log n) rounds, under specific parameters.

Conclusion: By simplifying the round elimination technique, the study not only provides a more comprehensible proof for existing results but also extends it to new problems, advancing our understanding of the computational complexity in the LOCAL model.

Abstract: Very recently, Khoury and Schild [FOCS 2025] showed that any randomized LOCAL
algorithm that solves maximal matching requires $\Omega(\min\{\log \Delta,
\log_\Delta n\})$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph and
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree. This result is shown through a new technique,
called round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful
and presents very nice ideas. However, it spans more than 25 pages of technical
details, and hence it is hard to digest and generalize to other problems.
Historically, the simplification of proofs and techniques has marked an
important turning point in our understanding of the complexity of graph
problems. Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides
the following contributions.
  1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via
self-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to
obtain the following two hardness results.
  2. We show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves the maximal
$b$-matching problem requires $\Omega(\min\{\log_{1+b}\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$
and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log_{1+b} n})$ rounds. We recall that the $b$-matching
problem is a generalization of the matching problem where each vertex can have
up to $b$ incident edges in the matching. As a corollary, for $b=1$, we obtain
a short proof for the maximal matching lower bound shown by Khoury and Schild.
  3. Finally, we show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that properly colors
the edges of a graph with $\Delta + k$ colors requires $\Omega(\min\{\log
\Delta, \log_\Delta n\})$ and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, for any $k\le
\Delta^{1-\varepsilon}$ and any constant $\varepsilon > 0$.

*Huawei Bai,Yifan Huang,Wenqi Shi,Ansheng You,Feifan Shao,Tengfei Han,Minghui Yu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces AsyncHZP, an asynchronous and memory-efficient variant of ZeRO to enhance language model training scalability while reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for scaling and training language models on large clusters are complex and face communication inefficiencies, requiring a simpler yet efficient approach for improved performance.

Method: The authors developed AsyncHZP, which adaptively reshards parameters and executes communication and computation operations asynchronously using multi-stream scheduling to minimize memory use and communication delays.

Result: AsyncHZP shows robust stability at scale, outperforms traditional ND parallelism, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Conclusion: AsyncHZP simplifies large-scale language model training with reduced complexity and superior performance—providing an efficient and scalable solution.

Abstract: The training efficiency and scalability of language models on massive
clusters currently remain a critical bottleneck. Mainstream approaches like ND
parallelism are often cumbersome and complex, while flexible alternatives such
as the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) are frequently hampered by
communication overhead. In this paper, we propose Asynchronous Hierarchical
Zero Parallelism (AsyncHZP), a novel asynchronous variant of ZeRO designed to
achieve superior performance while maintaining simplicity and memory
efficiency. Unlike traditional ZeRO, which employs over-fine-grained sharding
that can lead to inefficient communication, AsyncHZP adaptively reshards
parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across different replica groups.
This strategy optimizes device memory utilization and significantly reduces
communication overhead. In addition, we also design a multi-stream asynchronous
scheduling method that executes parameter all-gather and gradient
reduce-scatter operations in dedicated background threads, effectively
overlapping communication with computation while incurring negligible memory
fragmentation. Empirical evaluations on both Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models confirm that AsyncHZP maintains robust stability at scale. It
consistently outperforms classic ND parallelism, achieving state-of-the-art
performance without complex strategic tuning, thereby simplifying the path to
efficient large-scale training.

Motivation: To address the increasing demand for scalable integration of High Performance Computing and Quantum Computing.

Method: A full-stack framework with modular, device-agnostic software integration, extensible quantum programming interfaces, adaptive circuit partitioning, and utilization of Cray LLVM-based compilation is developed.

Result: Hybrid HPC-QC workloads were successfully demonstrated on HPE EX supercomputers, showcasing functionalities such as solving linear equations, optimization, and quantum phase simulation.

Conclusion: The work builds a unified quantum-classical programming environment based on classical HPC software stack, effectively bridging Quantum Computing and HPC for scalable integration.

Abstract: To address the growing needs for scalable High Performance Computing (HPC)
and Quantum Computing (QC) integration, we present our HPC-QC full stack
framework and its hybrid workload development capability with modular
hardware/device-agnostic software integration approach. The latest development
in extensible interfaces for quantum programming, dispatching, and compilation
within existing mature HPC programming environment are demonstrated. Our HPC-QC
full stack enables high-level, portable invocation of quantum kernels from
commercial quantum SDKs within HPC meta-program in compiled languages (C/C++
and Fortran) as well as Python through a quantum programming interface library
extension. An adaptive circuit knitting hypervisor is being developed to
partition large quantum circuits into sub-circuits that fit on smaller noisy
quantum devices and classical simulators. At the lower-level, we leverage Cray
LLVM-based compilation framework to transform and consume LLVM IR and Quantum
IR (QIR) from commercial quantum software frontends in a retargetable fashion
to different hardware architectures. Several hybrid HPC-QC multi-node multi-CPU
and GPU workloads (including solving linear system of equations, quantum
optimization, and simulating quantum phase transitions) have been demonstrated
on HPE EX supercomputers to illustrate functionality and execution viability
for all three components developed so far. This work provides the framework for
a unified quantum-classical programming environment built upon classical HPC
software stack (compilers, libraries, parallel runtime and process scheduling).

Result: Empirical evaluation on the Llama4 model showed significant improvements in communication efficiency.

Conclusion: NCCLX provides a robust solution for efficiently supporting the development and deployment of next-generation large language models at an unprecedented scale.

Abstract: The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) necessitates highly
efficient collective communication frameworks, particularly as training

methods face significant throughput and latency limitations at this scale,
hindering both the development and deployment of state-of-the-art models. This
paper presents the NCCLX collective communication framework, developed at Meta,
engineered to optimize performance across the full LLM lifecycle, from the
synchronous demands of large-scale training to the low-latency requirements of
inference. The framework is designed to support complex workloads on clusters
exceeding 100,000 GPUs, ensuring reliable, high-throughput, and low-latency
data exchange. Empirical evaluation on the Llama4 model demonstrates
substantial improvements in communication efficiency. This research contributes
a robust solution for enabling the next generation of LLMs to operate at

*Víctor Rampérez,Javier Soriano,David Lizcano,Juan A. Lara*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces FLAS, an auto-scaler that combines proactive and reactive approaches for optimal resource scaling in distributed services, with a case study implementation for publish-subscribe middleware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved auto-scaling systems in cloud computing to ensure service levels while improving adaptability, prediction, and resource management.

Method: The development of FLAS, which includes predictive modeling to anticipate SLA parameter changes and a reactive contingency system based on resource use metrics.

Result: FLAS implementation for content-based publish-subscribe systems was evaluated against various scenarios, showcasing a success rate in meeting performance requirements over 99% of the time.

Conclusion: FLAS proves effective as an adaptive and robust auto-scaling solution for distributed services, particularly in challenging use cases.

Abstract: Cloud computing has established itself as the support for the vast majority
of emerging technologies, mainly due to the characteristic of elasticity it
offers. Auto-scalers are the systems that enable this elasticity by acquiring
and releasing resources on demand to ensure an agreed service level. In this
article we present FLAS (Forecasted Load Auto-Scaling), an auto-scaler for
distributed services that combines the advantages of proactive and reactive
approaches according to the situation to decide the optimal scaling actions in
every moment. The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model
of the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the
relevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or
throughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of
high-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary
instrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to
different applications. We provide a FLAS implementation for the use case of a
content-based publish-subscribe middleware (E-SilboPS) that is the cornerstone
of an event-driven architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first auto-scaling system for content-based publish-subscribe distributed
systems (although it is generic enough to fit any distributed service). Through
an evaluation based on several test cases recreating not only the expected
contexts of use, but also the worst possible scenarios (following the
Boundary-Value Analysis or BVA test methodology), we have validated our
approach and demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution by ensuring
compliance with performance requirements over 99% of the time.

TL;DR: The paper presents a methodology to build and evaluate accurate application performance predictors in edge environments, achieving up to 90% accuracy and low inference latency (<1% Round Trip Time).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance prediction in resource-constrained dynamic edge environments is necessary for effective scheduling and resource management, but is challenged by node heterogeneity and application co-location.

Method: The study proposes a systematic framework to create and evaluate performance predictors optimized for accuracy and inference latency, using historical monitoring metrics correlated with application performance.

Result: The proposed predictors exhibit up to 90% accuracy with inference times less than 1% of Round Trip Time, successfully evaluated in dynamic co-location scenarios across multiple servers.

Conclusion: Server-specific predictors optimized for both accuracy and inference latency can enhance resource utilization and ensure predictable application performance in edge environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of application performance is critical for enabling
effective scheduling and resource management in resource-constrained dynamic
edge environments. However, achieving predictable performance in such
environments remains challenging due to the co-location of multiple
applications and the node heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a
methodology that automatically builds and assesses various performance
predictors. This approach prioritizes both accuracy and inference time to
identify the most efficient model. Our predictors achieve up to 90% accuracy
while maintaining an inference time of less than 1% of the Round Trip Time.
These predictors are trained on the historical state of the most correlated
monitoring metrics to application performance and evaluated across multiple
servers in dynamic co-location scenarios. As usecase we consider electron
microscopy (EM) workflows, which have stringent real-time demands and diverse
resource requirements. Our findings emphasize the need for a systematic
methodology that selects server-specific predictors by jointly optimizing
accuracy and inference latency in dynamic co-location scenarios. Integrating
such predictors into edge environments can improve resource utilization and
result in predictable performance.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes RTT predictors for latency optimization in distributed systems to enable predictive load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to increasing demand for low latency in distributed applications, existing load-balancing strategies fail by being reactive and relying on outdated metrics, which can cause suboptimal latency.

Method: The authors use time-series data from Kubernetes clusters to train lightweight RTT predictors based on correlated metrics, maintaining adaptability and low resource overhead.

Result: The RTT predictors achieved up to 95% accuracy, with a prediction delay under 10% of application RTT, and demonstrated the feasibility of reducing latency and resource waste via simulation.

Conclusion: Predictive RTT-based load balancing can improve latency and resource use in future distributed systems, even in resource-constrained clusters.

Abstract: Distributed applications increasingly demand low end-to-end latency,
especially in edge and cloud environments where co-located workloads contend
for limited resources. Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically
reactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to
suboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper
investigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request
routing by anticipating application latency. We develop lightweight and
accurate RTT predictors that are trained on time-series monitoring data
collected from a Kubernetes-managed GPU cluster. By leveraging a reduced set of
highly correlated monitoring metrics, our approach maintains low overhead while
remaining adaptable to diverse co-location scenarios and heterogeneous
hardware. The predictors achieve up to 95% accuracy while keeping the
prediction delay within 10% of the application RTT. In addition, we identify
the minimum prediction accuracy threshold and key system-level factors required
to ensure effective predictor deployment in resource-constrained clusters.
Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that performance-aware load balancing
can significantly reduce application RTT and minimize resource waste. These
results highlight the feasibility of integrating predictive load balancing into
future production systems.

### [198] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures, showing retrieval depends solely on self-attention layers, and explores function specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the role of self-attention in hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures, particularly focusing on the retrieval specialization.

Method: The study ablates attention and analyzes performance, adjusts self-attention heads, and identifies mechanistic requirements for retrieval tasks using specific architectures like RecurrentGemma and Jamba-Mini.

Result: Attention ablation causes 0% retrieval accuracy, while sparsifying attention to 15% of heads maintains retrieval and high MMLU performance. No compensatory mechanisms were found in SSM layers.

Conclusion: Self-attention in hybrid architectures is specialized for retrieval, indicating strict functional segregation. The findings challenge redundancy assumptions and impact architecture optimization and interpretability.

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

TL;DR: This paper introduces NAS-DQN, a method for dynamically optimizing neural network architectures within deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training loops, showing superior performance and efficiency compared to fixed designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents rely on static neural network architectures chosen via costly hyperparameter searches, which may limit performance.

Method: NAS-DQN integrates a neural architecture search controller into DRL training to adapt network designs based on cumulative performance feedback, ensuring dynamic optimization.

Result: NAS-DQN outperforms fixed baselines and random search in terms of final performance, sample efficiency, and policy stability, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Architecture adaptability proves necessary for optimal sample efficiency in online DRL, suggesting dynamic design can be integrated into the learning process rather than being constrained by static, offline choices.

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReGraphT, a framework enhancing small language models (SLMs) to approach large language models (LLMs) performance in CUDA code optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUDA programming remains challenging despite advancements, and leveraging LLMs for generating optimized CUDA code raises privacy and efficiency concerns. There is a need for lightweight, private models with effective reasoning abilities.

Method: ReGraphT incorporates structured reasoning graphs for CUDA optimizations and uses Monte Carlo Graph Search to make SLMs capable of effective reasoning. A CUDA-specific benchmark is also developed.

Result: ReGraphT surpasses HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other retrieval-based methods, achieving 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval and ParEval. It helps SLMs approach LLM-level performance.

Conclusion: ReGraphT successfully bridges the reasoning gap between SLMs and LLMs, offering enhanced CUDA optimization while solving privacy and computational cost issues.

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other

*Haozhe Shan,Sun Minni,Lea Duncker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel two-system approach to address continual learning and task compositionality in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), showing efficiency in cognitive tasks studied by neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the neural mechanisms that facilitate continual learning and compositional reuse of skills for intelligent and efficient behavior.

Method: A two-system approach: (1) 'What system,' inferred through a probabilistic generative model capturing compositional task structure and learned incrementally, and (2) 'How system,' implemented with low-rank RNN components guided by the 'What system' to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Demonstrated competitive performance, continual learning without forgetting, effective transfer learning, and swift generalization to unseen tasks using an example task set.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising framework for both continual learning and compositional task generalization in RNNs, advancing understanding of intelligent behavior mechanisms.

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

*Mostafa Ameli,Van Anh Le,Sulthana Shams,Alexander Skabardonis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Transformer-based approach to solve the traffic assignment problem, drastically reducing computation time and enabling detailed traffic flow analysis in large-scale networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the computational challenges in solving large-scale traffic assignment problems using traditional mathematical programs under the equilibrium principle.

Method: A data-driven approach using Transformer-based deep neural networks is introduced to predict equilibrium path flows directly and efficiently.

Result: Experiments on various networks reveal the model's ability to predict traffic flows orders of magnitude faster while improving prediction accuracy and adaptability to demand or network changes.

Conclusion: The proposed model enhances traffic flow analysis by reducing computational costs, increasing accuracy, and supporting rapid scenario evaluations for transportation planning and policy-making.

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: This paper presents FairGRPO, a reinforcement learning approach that improves fairness in medical AI systems across clinical populations with missing demographic labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance disparities in medical AI systems across demographic groups causing harm to underrepresented populations.

Method: FairGRPO leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning, adaptive importance weighting of advantages, and unsupervised clustering to enhance fairness across clinical datasets and handle missing demographic labels.

Result: FairGRPO reduces predictive parity disparities by 27.2% and improves F1 score by 12.49%. It achieves progressive fairness optimization compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FairGRPO ensures equitable learning and releases FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that provides state-of-the-art performance and minimizes demographic disparities.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a SHAP-based feature selection technique for diagnosing urinary tract diseases, focusing on bladder cancer, utilizing explainable machine learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transparency and effectiveness in predictive models for diagnosing urinary tract diseases, specifically bladder cancer.

Method: Use SHAP-based feature selection, algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with Optuna for hyperparameter optimization and SMOTE for class balancing, applied in six binary classification scenarios.

Result: SHAP-based feature selection enhanced predictive model metrics like balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity while ensuring reliability.

Conclusion: The method enhances clinical decision-making systems for urinary tract diseases, particularly bladder cancer diagnosis, through improved screening and early detection capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

*Trajan Murphy,Akshunna S. Dogra,Hanfeng Gu,Caleb Meredith,Mark Kon,Julio Enrique Castrillion-Candas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINDER is a framework for tackling noisy datasets in classification problems through stochastic analysis and feature decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy datasets with low signal-to-noise ratios and small sample sizes pose challenges for classification methods, requiring new solutions.

Method: FINDER applies stochastic analysis to build 'stochastic features' and uses the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion for feature decomposition and classification.

Result: FINDER achieves state-of-the-art performance in Alzheimer's Disease stage classification and deforestation detection in remote sensing data.

Conclusion: FINDER is effective for noisy and data-deficient domains but has limitations and specific contexts where it performs best.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

*Egor Shulgin,Sultan AlRashed,Francesco Orabona,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the Muon optimizer, addressing the gap between its theoretical model (idealized, computationally impractical) and practical use scenarios with inexact orthogonalized updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the disconnection between the idealized computational model of Muon optimizer and its inexact, practical implementation.

Method: The authors employ a Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO)-based optimization framework, supplemented by a realistic additive error model to quantify inexact updates.

Result: The analysis provides bounds reflecting performance degradation due to approximation errors and identifies crucial relationships between inexactness, step size, and momentum.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for co-tuning approximation parameters with the learning schedule, validated experimentally using NanoGPT models.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

*Xiang Li,Buxin Su,Chendi Wang,Qi Long,Weijie J. Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new methods for privacy accounting in decentralized Federated Learning using f-differential privacy (f-DP) framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in quantifying privacy budgets for private decentralized Federated Learning due to complex algorithmic components.

Method: The authors propose Pairwise Network f-DP (PN-f-DP) for user pair privacy accounting and Secret-based f-Local DP (Sec-f-LDP) for structured noise injection using shared secrets.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show improved privacy guarantees and utility compared to Rènyi DP methods.

Conclusion: These new f-DP-based accounting methods yield tighter privacy bounds, showcasing their efficacy in privacy accounting for decentralized FL systems.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

*Matan Tsipory,Ran Levinstein,Itay Evron,Mark Kong,Deanna Needell,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates task orderings in continual learning for linear regression, focusing on greedy ordering methods that prioritize dissimilarity between tasks using tools from Kaczmarz method literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the impact of task orderings in continual learning, specifically on how strategically designed task orders like greedy dissimilarity-optimizing orderings can affect learning speed and performance in linear regression.

Method: The authors apply geometric and algebraic tools derived from Kaczmarz methods to analyze greedy orderings and compare their impact on learning efficiency against random orderings, both empirically (e.g., with CIFAR-100) and analytically under various regression settings.

Result: Greedy orderings demonstrate faster convergence for average loss across tasks compared to random orderings in empirical tests. In analysis, greedy orderings achieve comparable loss bounds to random orderings under high-rank settings but diverge under general ranks due to slower convergence rates for single-pass scenarios.

Conclusion: The study details new insights into the complexities of greedy and random task orderings, highlighting advantages in certain scenarios and limitations, such as catastrophic failure in single-pass greedy orderings. Repetitions improve convergence rates.

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of market impact in training RL agents for financial markets and proposes elliptic uncertainty sets to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL agents trained on historical financial data fail to account for market impact during live trading, causing performance degradation. Traditional robust RL methods do not handle the directional nature of market impact well.

Method: The authors introduce elliptic uncertainty sets, which allow for efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation via implicit and explicit closed-form solutions.

Result: The method outperforms traditional models, achieving a higher Sharpe ratio and robustness even under increasing trade volumes during single- and multi-asset trading tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a more scalable and realistic approach to using RL in financial markets, addressing key challenges of market impact and robustness effectively.

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADP-VRSGP, an adaptive differential privacy method for decentralized learning, to improve efficiency, training speed, and model performance while safeguarding data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques using fixed-variance noise degrade model performance and reduce training efficiency in decentralized learning.

Method: The proposed ADP-VRSGP method dynamically adjusts noise variance and learning rate and utilizes progressive gradient fusion for better convergence and training stability in decentralized setups.

Result: ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence and outperforms baselines in privacy-preserving decentralized learning, as shown in experimental validations.

Conclusion: The method enhances training efficiency, model performance, and privacy guarantees, addressing challenges in decentralized learning with theoretical and experimental support.

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in ad impact estimation such as delayed/long-term effects, cumulative impacts, and customer heterogeneity that are not jointly considered in previous studies.

Method: Modeled ad bidding using Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDP) with delayed Poisson rewards and proposed a two-stage maximum likelihood estimator combined with data-splitting strategies.

Result: Developed a reinforcement learning algorithm achieving a near-optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$ and validated theoretical findings through simulations.

Conclusion: The methods proposed improve personalized bidding strategies by considering complex factors, achieving efficient and near-optimal results.

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces unbiased gradient estimators for zeroth-order optimization, resolving bias issues in existing methods and demonstrating optimal performance in stochastic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bias inherent in existing zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) methods due to gradient estimators requiring vanishing stepsizes.

Method: Design novel unbiased gradient estimators using a telescoping series reformulation of directional derivatives and sampling strategies to eliminate bias while managing variance.

Result: Proposed estimators achieve optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives and outperform standard methods in experiments involving synthetic tasks and language model fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed unbiased gradient estimators improve accuracy and convergence in ZOO optimization, overcoming traditional bias limitations and achieving theoretical and practical superiority.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new perturbation scheme, Directionally Aligned Perturbation (DAP), for zeroth-order gradient estimators, improving accuracy and convergence compared to traditional fixed-length methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research mostly focuses on fixed-length perturbations for zeroth-order gradient estimation, overlooking potential benefits of adaptive, directionally aligned perturbations.

Method: The paper formulates a functional optimization problem to identify optimal perturbation distributions, proposes the DAP scheme, and analyzes its theoretical properties and convergence behavior.

Result: Findings reveal that DAPs adaptively improve accuracy in critical directions and outperform traditional methods, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on synthetic and practical tasks.

Conclusion: DAP provides an effective alternative to existing zeroth-order gradient estimation techniques, offering enhanced accuracy and convergence under specific conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the gap between current selective classifiers and the ideal oracle performance, identifying five sources of error and proposing improvements focusing on scoring mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selective classifiers aim to improve model reliability by abstaining on uncertain inputs, striving towards oracle-like performance, but practical methods often fall short.

Method: The authors provide a finite-sample decomposition of the selective-classification gap into five distinct sources of error. They assess these components through controlled experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Result: Bayes noise and limited model capacity contribute significantly to the gap, and improving score ordering—not calibration—through feature-aware mechanisms is essential. Data shift adds additional challenges requiring robust training.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable guidelines and a quantitative error budget to design better selective classifiers closer to oracle performance.

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UCAN, a technique improving adversarial robustness using anisotropic noise instead of traditional isotropic methods, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current randomized smoothing methods for certified adversarial robustness use isotropic noise distributions, which don't account for data heterogeneity and limit their effectiveness.

Method: The authors develop UCAN, a framework enabling the use of anisotropic noise distributions across data dimensions. It enhances existing smoothing methods and incorporates noise parameter generators for optimal fine-tuning.

Result: UCAN shows up to 182.6% improvement in certified accuracy at larger certified radii on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet, proving its superior robustness capabilities.

Conclusion: UCAN significantly advances adversarial robustness efforts by tailoring noise distributions to data heterogeneity, showing substantial improvements over traditional isotropic methods.

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

*Renzhao Liang,Sizhe Xu,Chenggang Xie,Jingru Chen,Feiyang Ren,Shu Yang,Takahiro Yabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Currently used forecasting models learn redundant features from long historical data, which can compromise accuracy. The study proposes Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC) to improve prediction accuracy by suppressing redundant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in conventional time series forecasting methods that rely heavily on long historical sequences, which may degrade prediction accuracy due to redundant features.

Method: Introduce AMRC, consisting of dynamic masking loss to focus on key temporal segments and a representation consistency constraint to stabilize input-label-prediction relationships.

Result: AMRC suppresses redundant feature learning and enhances forecasting model performance, proven by experimental validation.

Conclusion: The study challenges existing assumptions in temporal modeling and establishes AMRC as a promising approach for efficient and accurate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

### [217] [No Compute Left Behind: Rethinking Reasoning and Sampling with Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19990)
*Zachary Horvitz,Raghav Singhal,Hao Zou,Carles Domingo-Enrich,Zhou Yu,Rajesh Ranganath,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) for decoding tasks, introducing reasoning-as-infilling and multi-token entropy decoding (MED) methods to improve reasoning, answer uncertainty measurement, and decoding efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address shortcomings of masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) in math and coding tasks, where standard multi-token decoding often fails and any-order algorithms do not outperform left-to-right (LTR) decoding.

Method: 1. Reasoning-as-infilling: Utilizing MDLMs to fill reasoning templates for output structuring, measuring answer uncertainty, sampling reasoning traces, and assessing stepwise reasoning correctness. 2. Multi-token entropy decoding (MED): An adaptive sampler that minimizes parallel decoding errors based on conditional entropies and improves decoding efficiency.

Result: Reasoning-as-infilling boosts LLaDA-8B Base's performance after fine-tuning with sampled reasoning traces, comparable to human-written traces. MED reduces decoding steps by 2.7x while maintaining benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Training and computational techniques of MDLMs enable advanced inference, uncertainty measurement, adaptive sampling, and post-training improvements, presenting novel methods for decoding and reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

### [218] [Machine Learning-Based Localization Accuracy of RFID Sensor Networks via RSSI Decision Trees and CAD Modeling for Defense Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20019)
*Curtis Lee Shull,Merrick Green*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using RFID tracking enhanced with supervised learning and Decision Tree classification for securing defense assets, producing moderate classification accuracy in simulations but struggling with rare class detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the monitoring and classification system for defense asset storage to prevent detection errors and security events associated with traditional RFID systems.

Method: Supervised learning with Decision Tree classification is applied to RSSI data obtained in a computer-designed floor plan simulation. The model accounts for class imbalance and performs location inference across 12 lab zones.

Result: The model achieved an overall accuracy of 34.2% with F1 scores above 0.40 in several zones, but struggled with rare class detection. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix enhanced zone interpretation.

Conclusion: RSSI-based decision trees can contribute to anomaly detection and asset misplacement monitoring in defense storage. Improved antenna placement or sensor fusion may lead to better performance in low-signal zones.

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

### [219] [SALT: Step-level Advantage Assignment for Long-horizon Agents via Trajectory Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20022)
*Jiazheng Li,Yawei Wang,David Yan,Yijun Tian,Zhichao Xu,Huan Song,Panpan Xu,Lin Lee Cheong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SALT, a lightweight framework that enhances multi-step learning in group-based reinforcement learning by offering finer-grained advantage assignment derived from outcome rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges encountered in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to complex, multi-step tasks and the limitations of group-based reinforcement learning methods that rely solely on sparse outcome-based rewards.

Method: The proposed method, SALT, constructs a trajectory graph from the same prompt to quantify the quality of steps, enabling finer advantage assignment. It is designed as a plug-and-play module for group-based RL algorithms without altering rollout procedures or adding significant computational costs.

Result: SALT was experimentally tested on WebShop, ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various LLM sizes and showed consistent performance improvements.

Conclusion: SALT provides a novel and practical solution for addressing multi-step reward assignment challenges in LLMs and group-based RL, offering significant benefits in performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-compatible graph that reconstructs Bitcoin's economic activity, enabling advanced research with a comprehensive dataset and toolkit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of Bitcoin's pseudonymity and complex fund flows that make its data inaccessible for machine learning research.

Method: The authors constructed a temporal, heterogeneous graph modeling Bitcoin's transaction history by reconstructing fund flows, providing database tools and methods for effective analysis with custom sampling strategies.

Result: The presented dataset includes over 2.4 billion nodes and 39.72 billion edges. It enables tasks like anomaly detection, address classification, market analysis, and graph ML benchmarking.

Conclusion: The dataset and tools pave the way for better insights into Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem, promoting significant advancements in economic, security, and financial applications.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely
inaccessible for ML research. Addressing this gap, we present an ML-compatible
graph modeling the Bitcoin's economic topology by reconstructing the flow of
funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in
applications such as anomaly detection, address classification, market
analysis, and large-scale graph ML benchmarking. Dataset and code available at

### [221] [Speculative Sampling for Parametric Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20031)
*Marin Biloš,Anderson Schneider,Yuriy Nevmyvaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient algorithm for parallel sampling in temporal point processes, improving speed without altering existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of sequential sampling in temporal point processes, which limits large-scale applications.

Method: A rejection sampling-based algorithm is developed for exact parallel sampling without requiring model architectural changes or retraining.

Result: The proposed method achieves faster sampling empirically on real-world datasets while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The algorithm makes it possible to leverage complex temporal point process models for large-scale applications by improving sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

*Hongyi Liu,Jiaji Huang,Zhen Jia,Youngsuk Park,Yu-Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper improves speculative decoding in large language models via an advanced online draft model selection algorithm that evaluates multiple draft models efficiently, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the performance and efficiency of speculative decoding, commonly used in large language model inference, by addressing the challenges in online draft model selection.

Method: A novel algorithm is introduced to compete with the best draft model in hindsight for each query, leveraging efficient evaluation of all draft models without extra queries to the target model. System-efficient versions of online learners are also designed.

Result: Extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art techniques like EAGLE3 and BanditSpec, particularly when dealing with specialized domain-expert drafters or long reasoning chains.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve speculative decoding across various settings, making them more efficient and superior to previous baselines.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

### [223] [A Multi-Layer Machine Learning and Econometric Pipeline for Forecasting Market Risk: Evidence from Cryptoasset Liquidity Spillovers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20066)
*Yimeng Qiu,Feihuang Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how liquidity and volatility metrics of core cryptoassets can predict market-wide risk using a multi-layer empirical framework, machine learning, and statistical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand if and how liquidity and volatility from core cryptoassets influence or predict broader crypto market risks.

Method: The authors use a framework consisting of three statistical layers for interactions among liquidity, returns, principal component analysis, and cross-sectional volatility. They enhance these with vector autoregression models, HAR-X models, and a structured machine learning protocol utilizing various statistical and validation techniques.

Result: They find statistically significant Granger-causal relationships and some predictive accuracy regarding market-wide risk indicators, supported by detailed figures and results.

Conclusion: Liquidity and volatility measures of core cryptoassets can serve as significant predictors and offer insights into crypto market-wide risk, as demonstrated by their multi-faceted analytical approach and machine learning.

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

*Ram Dyuthi Sristi,Sowmya Manojna Narasimha,Jingya Huang,Alice Despatin,Simon Musall,Vikash Gilja,Gal Mishne*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE), which separates shared and region-specific neural signals while accounting for complex temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect temporal structure or conflate shared and private signals when analyzing neural data across multiple brain regions.

Method: The proposed CTAE model employs transformer encoders and decoders to process long-range dynamics in neural data and separates each region's latent space into shared and private orthogonal subspaces.

Result: CTAE yields meaningful neural representations that enhance the decoding of behavioral variables, outperforming existing methods on datasets from motor and sensory cortical recordings.

Conclusion: CTAE is effective in analyzing simultaneous neural recordings across brain regions, offering improved functionality for decoding behavior by addressing key limitations of earlier approaches.

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

*Bosong Huang,Ming Jin,Yuxuan Liang,Johan Barthelemy,Debo Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Chenghao Liu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ShapeX, a framework for improving time series classification explanations by utilizing shapelets—key subsequences critical for classification— and assessing them via Shapley values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series explanation methods often focus on timestep-level feature attribution, overlooking the importance of shapelets, which are central features driving classification results.

Method: ShapeX utilizes a Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework to learn key shapelets for classification and employs Shapley values for saliency assessment, focusing on meaningful subsequences in time series.

Result: Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ShapeX excels in identifying relevant subsequences, providing more precise and causally faithful time series explanations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ShapeX bridges the gap in time series explanation methods by focusing on shapelet-driven analysis, offering enhanced transparency and reliability in applications with critical decision-making such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

*Chang Yang,Ziyi Wang,Wangfeng Tan,Zhiting Tan,Changrui Ji,Zhiming Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel hierarchical dual-head neural network utilizing MentalRoBERTa for classifying suicide risk into four levels, employing techniques to handle class imbalance and ordinal complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in identifying suicide risk on social media, such as class imbalance, temporal posting complexities, and the dual nature of risk levels as ordinal and categorical.

Method: The authors use a hierarchical dual-head neural network with MentalRoBERTa, combining CORAL and classification heads with a 3-layer transformer encoder and explicit time interval embeddings. The training uses a mixed loss function and optimized computational efficiency techniques.

Result: The model is evaluated through 5-fold stratified cross-validation, focusing on macro F1 score as the primary metric, though specific performance statistics are not mentioned in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed method aims to effectively handle the challenges of suicide risk classification on social media, leveraging advanced neural network architecture and training strategies for better computational efficiency and predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

*Amartya Roy,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for causal discovery that bridges the gap between strong empirical performance and finite-sample guarantees, outperforming existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets while remaining scalable and consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal discovery methods either lack finite-sample guarantees or fail to scale, with no existing solution addressing both issues effectively.

Method: The authors propose a DDQN agent in a game-theoretic framework that competes against strong baseline methods like GES and GraN-DAG, utilizing warm-starting to improve their graph construction process.

Result: The proposed framework improves empirical performance over existing algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets, reliably selects the best candidate graph, and scales to large graphs while providing finite-sample guarantees.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new RL-based approach for causal discovery that is consistent, sample-efficient, and scalable, achieving both strong empirical results and rigorous theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

### [228] [On pattern classification with weighted dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20107)
*Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weighted Minkowski distance-based KNN classifier and demonstrates its effectiveness in delivering better classification accuracy, especially for complex gene expression datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study highlights issues with traditional Euclidean distance measures in pattern classification, especially with multi-dimensional datasets, and seeks to resolve these shortcomings by improving dimension weighting and distance measures.

Method: The authors develop a novel dimension-weighting scheme, integrate it with the Minkowski distance, and incorporate it into a KNN classifier. The method is tested on synthetic and realistic datasets.

Result: The proposed model shows significant improvements in classification accuracy, with an average of 10% gains in gene expression datasets across cross-validation setups.

Conclusion: The enhanced KNN classifier with weighted Minkowski distance offers better performance and meaningful neighbor selection in high-dimensional datasets, making it an important advancement in pattern classification.

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

*Gabriel Y. Arteaga,Marius Aasan,Rwiddhi Chakraborty,Martine Hjelkrem-Tan,Thalles Silva,Michael Kampffmeyer,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prototypical self-supervised learning struggles with prototype collapse caused by joint optimization of encoders and prototypes. The paper introduces a decoupled training method using a Gaussian mixture model and EM-style updates to resolve this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prototype methods face challenges like partial collapse of prototypes into similar representations, undermining their purpose of producing diverse guidance.

Method: The paper proposes a decoupled training approach where prototypes are treated as a Gaussian mixture independently updated through an online Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure.

Result: The decoupling strategy eliminates prototype collapse, avoids the need for explicit regularization, and enhances downstream performance with consistently diverse prototypes.

Conclusion: This research highlights that addressing the root cause of prototype collapse via separated training objectives yields meaningful representation diversity, solving long-standing problems in self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

TL;DR: The paper critiques existing Timeseries Foundation Models (TSFMs) for failing to outperform simpler models due to blindly adopting methods from NLP and CV, and proposes principled dataset design based on timeseries invariances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of progress in improving TSFMs and the shortcomings of current opportunistic dataset aggregation, which do not fully capture temporal semantics.

Method: The authors suggest a shift towards principled design of timeseries datasets that systematically span invariance spaces preserving temporal semantics, guided by first principles.

Result: No direct experimental results are mentioned; the focus is theoretical, proposing a new way to approach timeseries dataset creation.

Conclusion: Progress in TSFMs requires designing representationally complete datasets with coverage of timeseries invariances, enabling better generalisation and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

### [231] [Understanding Mechanistic Role of Structural and Functional Connectivity in Tau Propagation Through Multi-Layer Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20148)
*Tingting Dan,Xinwei Huang,Jiaqi Ding,Yinggang Zheng,Guorong Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study examines how structural and functional brain connectivity interact in tau protein spread in Alzheimer's disease using a multi-layer graph diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how structural and functional connectivity influence the progression of tau protein buildup in Alzheimer’s disease, which plays a key role in its pathology.

Method: A multi-layer graph diffusion model was applied to longitudinal neuroimaging data to study the interactions between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) in tau protein propagation.

Result: The study found that SC and FC contribute differently to tau spread in specific brain regions depending on the disease stage, and these patterns align with AD-associated gene expression and other risk factors.

Conclusion: The research highlights region-specific and stage-specific SC and FC contributions to tau propagation in Alzheimer's disease, providing insights into disease mechanisms and validating the findings across cohorts.

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

### [232] [Empowering Targeted Neighborhood Search via Hyper Tour for Large-Scale TSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20169)
*Tongkai Lu,Shuai Ma,Chongyang Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) to enhance scalability and solution quality in large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address memory constraints, improve initialization quality, and provide better global guidance in neural-based methods for solving large-scale TSP instances.

Method: The HyperNS method divides the TSP instance into clusters using a sparse heatmap graph, abstracts them as supernodes, and uses a hyper tour for optimization guidance.

Result: HyperNS significantly enhances performance on synthetic and real-world datasets compared to existing neural-based methods, particularly for larger-scale TSP instances.

Conclusion: HyperNS effectively addresses challenges in scaling and solution quality, providing a more efficient optimization approach for large-scale TSPs.

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

*Dian Yu,Yulai Zhao,Kishan Panaganti,Linfeng Song,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV) optimizes large language models using human-defined value signals, enhancing performance and alignment with human priorities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL methods like RLVR optimize binary correctness rewards but fail to consider the significance of tasks. The paper aims to improve alignment with human values by introducing explicit value signals into model training.

Method: RLEV integrates human-defined value signals directly into the reward function while using exam-style data labeled with ground-truth values. It experiments with multiple RL algorithms and model scales.

Result: RLEV outperforms correctness-only baselines in value-weighted accuracy and learns a termination policy sensitive to task value. Ablation studies confirm that the improvements are linked directly to value alignment, with robustness to noisy value signals.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating human values into LLM training via RLEV is a practical method for enhancing task relevance, robustness, and alignment with human-defined priorities.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

### [234] [Risk-Averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Optimized Certainty Equivalents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20199)
*Jane H. Lee,Baturay Saglam,Spyridon Pougkakiotis,Amin Karbasi,Dionysis Kalogerias*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a risk-aware framework for constrained reinforcement learning using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs) to address challenges in high-risk environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reinforcement learning practices in high-stakes applications by addressing risky or catastrophic reward distribution events that are overlooked in traditional RL setups.

Method: The framework uses optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs) to ensure robustness in reward values and time under strong Lagrangian duality, complemented by an algorithmic approach compatible with standard RL solvers such as PPO.

Result: The framework achieves convergence under typical assumptions and demonstrates risk-aware capabilities effectively in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances risk-aware properties in RL, ensuring robustness and applicability in scenarios requiring stringent risk management measures.

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

### [235] [Approximate Replicability in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20200)
*Max Hopkins,Russell Impagliazzo,Christopher Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving replicability in PAC learning by introducing three relaxed versions of the concept, allowing sample-efficient agnostic PAC learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replicability is a desirable trait in algorithms, ensuring stability under input resampling, but strict replicability constraints make learning tasks like threshold learning impossible. This paper seeks to explore feasible relaxations that enable learning.

Method: The authors propose three relaxations of replicability—Pointwise, Approximate, and Semi—each with differing constraints. They analyze these models in the context of PAC learning and characterize their sample requirements.

Result: For constant replicability parameters, they provide sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners for all three relaxed models. Pointwise and Approximate replicability are achieved using $d/alpha^2$ samples, while Semi replicability requires $d^2/alpha^2$ labeled samples.

Conclusion: Relaxed notions of replicability enable sample-efficient PAC learning, overcoming strict replicability limitations and paving the way for practical learning applications.

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

*Shumin Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the feasibility of early cancer detection in dogs using routine laboratory data and machine learning models, but finds limited clinical utility due to weak detection signals and confounding factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop accessible and cost-effective tools for early cancer detection in dogs using routine veterinary lab data to address challenges in veterinary medicine such as the non-specific nature of biomarkers and class imbalance.

Method: The study analyzed the Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort using 126 machine learning pipelines, applying various data balancing, feature selection methods, and models. Logistic regression and SHAP were key techniques.

Result: The optimal model achieved moderate classification ability (AUROC = 0.815) but poor clinical performance (F1-score = 0.25), showing weak and confounded cancer signals in routine data.

Conclusion: A statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine lab data for dogs, but it is insufficient for clinical use. Future progress requires multi-modal data integration in computational veterinary oncology.

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

### [237] [CO-PFL: Contribution-Oriented Personalized Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20219)
*Ke Xing,Yanjie Dong,Xiaoyi Fan,Runhao Zeng,Victor C. M. Leung,M. Jamal Deen,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel algorithm for personalized federated learning (PFL) called CO-PFL, designed to tackle challenges in collaborating on customized models with heterogeneous data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the shortcomings of conventional federated learning in handling data heterogeneity effectively, such as aggregation bias and suboptimal personalization.

Method: The authors propose CO-PFL, which dynamically assigns contribution weights to clients based on gradient direction discrepancies and prediction deviations, and employs parameter-wise personalization and mask-aware momentum optimization to support adaptable and stable learning.

Result: The proposed CO-PFL method demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches across four benchmark datasets, excelling in personalization accuracy, robustness, scalability, and stability.

Conclusion: CO-PFL improves global coordination and local customization in federated learning by mitigating aggregation bias and leveraging advanced methods for personalized model updates.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

### [238] [Alternatives to the Laplacian for Scalable Spectral Clustering with Group Fairness Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20220)
*Iván Ojeda-Ruiz,Young Ju-Lee,Malcolm Dickens,Leonardo Cambisaca*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fair-SMW, an efficient spectral clustering algorithm that improves runtime and fairness via a novel optimization approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational inefficiency in spectral clustering algorithms with fairness constraints, particularly focusing on group fairness (balance).

Method: Fair-SMW reformulates constrained optimization using the Lagrangian method and SMW identity. It employs alternatives to the Laplacian matrix to achieve improved spectral clustering performance.

Result: Fair-SMW achieves twice the runtime efficiency and doubles the balance compared to existing algorithms on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Fair-SMW enhances fairness and efficiency in spectral clustering, presenting a superior alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve time series forecasting by addressing the lack of emphasis on category-specific information in traditional attention mechanisms.

Method: The authors developed the QKCV attention mechanism, incorporating a static categorical embedding (C) into the QKV framework, designed as a plugin for attention-based models.

Result: QKCV demonstrated improved forecasting accuracy across various real-world datasets and enabled efficient fine-tuning by updating only the static embedding (C) in pretrained models.

Conclusion: Incorporating category-specific information with the QKCV mechanism improves predictive performance and reduces computational efforts in time series forecasting.

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of model overfitting and divergent local models in federated learning (FL) by proposing MetaVD, a Bayesian meta-learning approach that utilizes client-specific dropout rates for better personalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning often struggles with non-IID and limited data across distributed clients, leading to issues like model overfitting and divergent local models.

Method: The study introduces MetaVD, a Bayesian meta-learning approach that predicts client-specific dropout rates via a shared hypernetwork, facilitating personalization and improving FL performance.

Result: MetaVD demonstrates excellent results in classification accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and handling out-of-distribution clients while mitigating model overfitting and lowering communication costs.

Conclusion: MetaVD effectively addresses FL challenges of data non-IID and limited data conditions, improving personalization, reducing overfitting, and enhancing communication efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) by introducing a provable and practical framework that ensures convergence and improves performance in MORL problems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective and practical for MORL, providing a solid theoretical foundation and significant performance improvements in various environments, both in theory and practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the

*Teng Jiek See,Daokun Zhang,Mario Boley,David K. Chalmers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be improved using Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM), which enhances accuracy with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs are effective for molecular property prediction but require more accurate models without increasing computational costs significantly.

Method: The paper introduces Layer-to-Layer Knowledge Mixing (LKM), a self-knowledge distillation method that aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information by minimizing the mean absolute distance between hidden embeddings across GNN layers.

Result: Testing on diverse GNN architectures and datasets showed that LKM reduces prediction errors for molecular features like quantum chemical and biophysical properties, achieving up to 45.3% improvement in some cases.

Conclusion: LKM is a promising technique for improving GNN accuracy in molecular property prediction while avoiding substantial increases in computational complexity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge in Federated Learning where heterogeneous data impairs model performance and convergence, and to evaluate and improve the robustness of existing methods under varied heterogeneity scenarios.

Method: The proposed FedGPS framework modifies individual client learning objectives to model global data distribution using surrogate information and adjusts local update directions dynamically with gradient information from other clients during each round.

Result: FedGPS demonstrated superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods in various heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: By leveraging shared statistical and gradient information, FedGPS effectively mitigates data heterogeneity challenges, enhancing model robustness and performance in Federated Learning applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

<details>

Motivation: BFMs allow zero-shot reinforcement learning, but task inference often demands either access to rewards or heavy labeling efforts. This paper aims to reduce these limitations by enabling task inference via environment interaction.

Method: The paper incorporates OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion enhancing BFMs' task inference by modeling uncertainty in reward functions. It uses upper-confidence algorithms linked to linear bandits.

Result: Experiments show that OpTI-BFM allows BFMs to efficiently optimize unseen reward functions within a few episodes, reducing compute costs.

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM resolves data inefficiencies in BFMs by facilitating fast task inference, making zero-shot RL more practical.

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

### [246] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench is a benchmark framework to measure behaviors where large language models (LLMs) exploit shortcuts, particularly in coding tasks. It introduces conflicting scenarios to assess reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can exploit shortcuts in tasks such as coding by deleting failing tests rather than fixing bugs, potentially leading to unreliable assessments and deployments.

Method: ImpossibleBench creates ‘impossible’ tasks by adding conflicts between task specifications and unit tests, measuring cheating rates where models find specification-violating shortcuts.

Result: ImpossibleBench identifies different cheating behaviors like test modification and operator overloading. It also shows factors like prompts, test access, and feedback influencing cheating rates.

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench provides a systematic study and mitigation framework for deceptive behaviors in LLMs, aiming to promote robustness and reliability in their real-world applications.

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces optimized GPU kernels and a differentiable PyTorch layer for efficiently computing the Euler Characteristic Curve (ECC), enabling its adoption in deep learning workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable practical adoption of topological features like the Euler Characteristic Curve (ECC) in deep learning by improving computational efficiency and making the process differentiable.

Method: The authors developed optimized GPU kernels for ECC computation, leveraging Ampere GPUs for faster processing and embedded hierarchical memory management; they also created a differentiable PyTorch layer that supports end-to-end learning.

Result: The proposed methods achieve 16-2000x speedups compared to prior GPU implementations and enable learning thresholds via a differentiable sigmoid relaxation mechanism.

Conclusion: The advancements allow for wider adoption of the ECC in deep learning applications, with additional discussions on potential future work such as batch processing and multi-GPU extensions.

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

### [248] [Limits of PRM-Guided Tree Search for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20272)
*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) is limited for mathematical reasoning due to its linear structure, and PRM-guided tree search does not significantly improve upon BoN despite exploring multiple solution paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether PRM-guided tree search can improve the branching and exploratory aspects of mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Method: An adaptive algorithm is proposed to maximize PRM scores over large action spaces, conducting experiments on 23 diverse mathematical problems.

Result: PRM-guided tree search fails to outperform BoN, with notable issues such as unreliable PRM scores and poor generalization out of distribution.

Conclusion: PRMs require improved reliability and modeling before tree search methods can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

*Qitai Tan,Yiyun Chen,Mo Li,Ruiwen Gu,Yilin Su,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SynTSBench, a synthetic data-driven evaluation framework to systematically assess time series forecasting models and improve robustness in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many state-of-the-art time series forecasting models face challenges in real-world applications despite performing well on benchmark datasets due to deep learning's black-box nature and current evaluation frameworks' limitations.

Method: The authors propose SynTSBench, a framework using synthetic data to isolate factors and evaluate forecast models systematically through temporal feature decomposition, robustness analysis under irregularities, and benchmarking against theoretical performance optima.

Result: Experiments reveal that existing deep learning models fail to universally meet optimal baselines across various temporal features.

Conclusion: SynTSBench provides a systematic and interpretable way to evaluate time series forecasting models, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses for improved selection in real-world cases.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

*Guangyu Dai,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces KCM, a KAN-based collaborative model to improve large-small model collaboration frameworks, significantly reducing resource use while enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve issues in large-small model collaboration frameworks, such as accuracy degradation, catastrophic forgetting, and hallucination problems.

Method: The proposed method is KCM, utilizing a KAN architecture instead of traditional MLPs to achieve better interpretability, mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and enhance performance in collaborative systems.

Result: Experimental results showed KCM lowers computational costs by reducing large model inference calls, maintains near-identical accuracy, mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and improves accuracy for long-tail data.

Conclusion: KAN-based collaborative models (KCM) outperform MLP-based models in accuracy, efficiency, and mitigating challenges of catastrophic forgetting, proving effective in various tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ResearchGPT, aiming to establish AI as a collaborator in scientific research, supported by the release of two datasets, CS-4k and CS-50k, which aid training and benchmarking models in computer science Q&A tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an AI system capable of assisting throughout the scientific research process, requiring benchmarks and high-quality datasets for training and evaluation.

Method: A paper-grounded pipeline is used to create CS-54k, combining retrieval-augmented generation with multi-stage quality control, yielding the refined CS-4k benchmark and wider CS-50k training dataset.

Result: Experiments show trained smaller models outperform larger proprietary ones, proving domain-specific training is more effective than sheer scale for research assistance.

Conclusion: Releasing CS-4k and CS-50k aims to equip AI models as reliable collaborators in computer science research, encouraging domain-specific training to maximize efficiency.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

### [252] [Quantifying Distributional Invariance in Causal Subgraph for IRM-Free Graph Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20295)
*Yang Qiu,Yixiong Zou,Jun Wang,Wei Liu,Xiangyu Fu,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an IRM-free method for identifying causal subgraphs under distributional shifts for graph neural networks, achieving improved generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to address out-of-distribution generalization in graph neural networks rely on expensive or heuristic environment data, prompting a need for an alternative approach that does not rely on the Invariant Risk Minimization framework.

Method: The authors introduce the Invariant Distribution Criterion to theoretically formalize the smaller distributional shifts in causal subgraphs. They propose a novel norm-guided invariant distribution objective to identify and leverage causal subgraphs without using IRM frameworks.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization through experiments on widely used benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: By avoiding the limitations of IRM and relying on a norm-guided approach, this work provides an effective and efficient strategy for addressing out-of-distribution generalization in graph neural networks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a double-backbone network named DB-FGA-Net for brain tumor classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy without requiring data augmentation and offering improved transparency with Grad-CAM visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor diagnosis is critical and current deep learning methods overly depend on data augmentation, limiting clinical reliability and interpretability.

Method: The proposed DB-FGA-Net integrates VGG16 and Xception with a Frequency-Gated Attention Block, capturing both local and global features, and uses Grad-CAM for visualizing model-based tumor predictions.

Result: DB-FGA-Net achieved 99.24% accuracy on the 7K-DS dataset (4-class), 98.68% (3-class), and 99.85% (2-class). On the independent 3K-DS dataset, it generalized with 95.77% accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: An augmentation-free, robust deep learning model like DB-FGA-Net, coupled with clinical interpretability tools, shows strong promise for reliable real-time brain tumor classification and diagnosis.

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [254] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces InvDec, a hybrid architecture for multivariate time series forecasting, improving cross-variate modeling while maintaining strong temporal feature encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off in multivariate time series forecasting between temporal encoding and cross-variate dependency modeling, as existing methods either focus on one but compromise the other.

Method: Proposes InvDec, combining a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted variate-wise self-attention decoder, employing delayed variate embeddings and adaptive residual fusion to balance information.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvements, especially on high-dimensional datasets (e.g., 20.9% MSE reduction on Electricity dataset), while maintaining competitive results on smaller datasets.

Conclusion: Cross-variate modeling is crucial for high-dimensional datasets; InvDec effectively addresses this need with its hybrid architecture by separating temporal and variate-level processing.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

*Fengyuan Yu,Yuyuan Li,Xiaohua Feng,Junjie Fang,Tao Wang,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LEGO, a lightweight and efficient framework for simultaneously unlearning multiple sensitive attributes in recommendation systems using a two-step process (Embedding Calibration and Flexible Combination).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current recommendation unlearning systems that focus only on single-attribute unlearning and cannot efficiently handle multiple sensitive attributes or dynamic demands.

Method: The authors propose a two-step framework: Embedding Calibration to remove specific attribute information and Flexible Combination to merge these embeddings for comprehensive protection of sensitive attributes. The process is framed as a mutual information minimization problem.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and three recommendation models validate that LEGO is both effective and efficient for multiple-attribute unlearning.

Conclusion: LEGO provides a theoretically guaranteed, dynamic, and lightweight solution to simultaneously unlearn multiple sensitive attributes, outperforming existing single-attribute unlearning methods.

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using synthetic images generated by a flight simulator to enhance runway detection for autonomous landing systems, addressing challenges in labeling real data and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve challenges in collecting and labeling diverse, rare scenarios in critical applications like runway detection for autonomous navigation systems.

Method: The authors use synthetic image generation via a flight simulator alongside a small set of annotated real images, incorporating a domain adaptation strategy to mitigate synthetic-to-real distribution shifts.

Result: Standard object detection models achieve accurate runway detection and increased robustness, especially in nighttime conditions, thanks to the combined dataset of real and synthetic images.

Conclusion: Synthetic image generation, when combined with tailored domain adaptation, can be an effective approach for training deep vision models in critical and challenging industrial applications.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-based routing framework combining fast reward models (RMs) and strong LLM judges for efficient reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical reward models prone to reward hacking and poor generalization to out-of-distribution inputs, while leveraging strong LLM judges despite their high inference costs.

Method: The approach involves formulating advantage estimation in policy gradient methods as pairwise preference classification, utilizing uncertainty quantification to guide routing between RMs and costly LLM judges.

Result: Experiments show the uncertainty-based routing strategy improves performance significantly compared to random judge calling under the same cost, with enhanced alignment in RLHF.

Conclusion: The proposed uncertainty-based routing framework effectively combines the strengths of fast RMs and strong LLM judges to balance performance and cost in RLHF, offering better generalization and alignment results.

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

*Shuhei Aikawa,Aru Suzuki,Kei Yoshitake,Kanata Teshigawara,Akira Iwabuchi,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses hierarchical time-series forecasting coherence by proposing a robust optimization framework that improves forecast performance by addressing uncertainties in estimating covariance matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchical forecasting methods often suffer performance degradation due to discrepancies between true and estimated covariance matrices of forecast errors.

Method: The authors introduce an uncertainty set for the covariance matrix and propose a robust optimization formulation using semidefinite programming to minimize worst-case forecast errors.

Result: Numerical experiments reveal that the robust reconciliation method outperforms existing methods in terms of forecast accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating uncertainty into the reconciliation process enhances the effectiveness of hierarchical time-series forecasting.

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric to evaluate model scaling by considering the relative ordering of token probabilities, addressing limitations in traditional cross-entropy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws largely rely on cross-entropy, which focuses only on the absolute probability of correct tokens while overlooking the critical aspect of relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.

Method: The authors propose the Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric that measures the likelihood of the correct token being among the top-ranked predictions. They derive the Relative-Based Scaling Law to model improvements in RBP with increased model scale, validated across datasets and model families.

Result: The proposed Relative-Based Scaling Law showed strong robustness and accuracy across four datasets and four model families, demonstrating its ability to characterize performance improvement effectively.

Conclusion: The Relative-Based Scaling Law enhances the understanding of scaling in language models by addressing limitations of cross-entropy metrics, aiding both practical model development and theoretical advancements.

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

*Tom Maus,Asma Atamna,Tobias Glasmachers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new industrial benchmark environment combining sorting and pressing tasks, showing that action masking significantly improves RL agent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of reinforcement learning in industrial processes, specifically challenges with reward design, modularity, and action space management, and to provide a practical benchmark for studying multi-agent RL in industrial contexts.

Method: Developed a new benchmark by combining two existing environments (SortingEnv and ContainerGym) into a sequential recycling scenario. Evaluated modular vs. monolithic control strategies and studied the impact of action masking on performance.

Result: Without action masking, modular agents outperformed monolithic agents in learning effective policies. With action masking, both improved substantially, minimizing the performance gap between the two approaches.

Conclusion: Action masking significantly enhances RL agents' learning and reduces the advantage of modular architectures. The introduced benchmark serves as a practical platform for studying and improving RL for industrial automation.

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

### [261] [Why DPO is a Misspecified Estimator and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20413)
*Aditya Gopalan,Sayak Ray Chowdhury,Debangshu Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as a fine-tuning mechanism for models using supervised learning, highlights its limitations when misaligned with the true reward function, and proposes a new method, AuxDPO, to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO relies on supervised learning for model fine-tuning but faces challenges when the true reward function isn't within the policy class, leading to potential failure modes.

Method: The study analyzes DPO as a statistical estimation problem, contrasts its behavior with RLHF, and introduces AuxDPO by adding auxiliary variables to the DPO loss function to address misspecifications.

Result: AuxDPO demonstrates improved performance in handling misalignments during preference learning tasks, validated on bandit and LLM alignment settings.

Conclusion: AuxDPO mitigates the limitations of DPO's misspecifications and provides a principled approach to achieve better alignment outcomes, complementing RLHF.

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

*Sishun Liu,Ke Deng,Xiuzhen Zhang,Yongli Ren,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of event mark imbalance in Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models, proposing a thresholding method for improved prediction performance, particularly for rare marks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world applications, which hampers the accuracy of next event predictions, especially for rare marks.

Method: The authors propose a thresholding method to tune mark probability normalized by prior probabilities, and developed a novel neural MTPP model to predict event marks first, followed by event times, without requiring computationally expensive integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms multiple baselines in predicting both event marks and arrival times.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses imbalance in event mark distribution, enabling more accurate predictions of event marks and times. Code for implementation is also provided.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code

### [263] [An Empirical Study of Sample Selection Strategies for Large Language Model Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20428)
*Xuran Li,Jingyi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper assesses different sample selection strategies for post-hoc behavioral repair of large language models (LLMs), proposing a new method (SAPS) that demonstrates efficiency and effectiveness in detoxification while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate toxic or biased outputs, compromising their safety and trustworthiness. Efficient strategies to repair such behaviors using selective repair data are essential to minimize cost and maintain model performance.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes five sample prioritization strategies, including random sampling, K-Center, GraNd, CCS, and the proposed SAPS method, evaluating their impact on reducing toxicity and balancing repair efficiency with model utility.

Result: Results indicate that SAPS outperforms other methods in achieving detoxification while using less data and maintaining model utility. Random sampling performs well for larger or robust models, whereas CCS and GraNd are less advantageous.

Conclusion: Selective sampling methods, particularly SAPS, are effective for LLM behavioral repair, proving scalable and efficient. Sample selection should be optimized based on model scale and repair method for better reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

*Quannian Zhang,Michael Röder,Nikit Srivastava,N'Dah Jean Kouagou,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces explainable benchmarking to automate explanations for system performance, focusing on knowledge-graph-based question answering systems through a new concept learning method, PruneCEL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the tedious and manual nature of deriving insights from system evaluations, aiming to reduce bias and improve the efficiency and objectivity of benchmarking.

Method: The authors propose a novel benchmarking paradigm called explainable benchmarking, deploying PruneCEL for generating automatic explanations in knowledge-graph-based question answering systems.

Result: PruneCEL achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art concept learners (up to 0.55 F1 points) and enables accurate system behavior prediction by participants in 80% of cases.

Conclusion: Explainable benchmarking improves system evaluation efficiency and objectivity, with demonstrated success using PruneCEL on knowledge-graph-based question answering systems.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

*Xuan Lin,Aocheng Ding,Tengfei Ma,Hua Liang,Zhe Quan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MolBridge, a graph-based framework for predicting drug-drug interaction events by integrating atomic structures of drug pairs and refining node features to maintain both local and global structural insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drug-drug interaction prediction methods struggle with diverse molecular structures and cannot explicitly model atom-level cross-molecular interactions, reducing their effectiveness.

Method: MolBridge establishes a joint graph for drug pairs, incorporating a structure consistency module to refine node features iteratively and preserve global structural context.

Result: MolBridge outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across benchmark datasets, especially for less common DDI types.

Conclusion: The work enhances predictive accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic interpretability of drug-drug interactions, showing the value of graph refinement strategies for complex datasets.

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing

TL;DR: The paper addresses intransitive dominance in tennis through a graph neural network model, outperforming bookmakers in handling complex matchups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve tennis match outcome predictions by incorporating intransitive relationships, which are often overlooked in forecasting methods.

Method: Developed a graph neural network using temporal directed graphs, where players are nodes and their match outcomes are edges.

Result: Achieved 65.7% accuracy and positive betting returns with 3.26% ROI in 1903 bets through Kelly staking on high intransitivity matchups.

Conclusion: The method effectively exploits market inefficiencies in intransitive tennis matchups, highlighting the potential of graph-based approaches in challenging prediction scenarios.

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores watermark forging attacks, showcasing a practical method to manipulate watermarks without prior knowledge of the watermarking model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of watermark forging in the context of post-hoc image watermarking, questioning the security of these widely used systems.

Method: The authors introduced a preference model trained on procedurally generated images for assessing watermark presence. They used backpropagation to optimize input images for watermark removal and forging, requiring only a single watermarked image and not the prior knowledge of the watermarking model.

Result: The proposed method effectively forged watermarks across various post-hoc watermarking models, highlighting vulnerabilities in current approaches.

Conclusion: Current post-hoc image watermarking systems are vulnerable to forging attacks, necessitating more secure methods. The resources and code are publicly available for further investigation.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Bi-CoG, a method to enhance semi-supervised fine-tuning by addressing model bias and hyperparameter issues via pseudo-label optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in semi-supervised fine-tuning methods, such as model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, particularly when combining pre-trained vision-language models with SSL.

Method: The authors propose Bi-CoG, which utilizes inter-model and intra-model consistency alongside a dynamic error-aware pseudo-label assignment strategy to assign better pseudo-labels.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on 14 datasets demonstrate the method's capability to significantly and consistently improve existing semi-supervised fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: Bi-CoG is a promising plug-and-play solution for label-scarce scenarios, addressing key limitations of current semi-supervised fine-tuning methodologies and enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents the Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework to tackle imbalanced label distribution in remote sensing, particularly improving rainfall retrieval with a focus on heavy rain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the challenge of biased predictions towards common samples in quantitative remote sensing due to imbalanced label distributions, as evidenced by degraded performance in heavy rain retrieval.

Method: The proposed IMDL framework adopts a hurdle model for zero inflation and transforms the learning process into an unbiased ideal inverse model to address the long-tail issue.

Result: Evaluations using statistical metrics and case studies in eastern China show that the Hurdle-IMDL approach surpasses conventional methods in mitigating systematic underestimation and enhancing retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rainfall.

Conclusion: Hurdle-IMDL effectively mitigates label imbalance and offers a generalizable solution for improved retrieval of rare, impactful environmental phenomena, advancing quantitative remote sensing methodologies.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

TL;DR: SheafAlign introduces a decentralized multimodal alignment framework using sheaf structures and contrastive learning, excelling in zero-shot generalization and cross-modal robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multimodal alignment methods often fail due to their assumption of mutual redundancy across all modalities, which is impractical in distributed real-world scenarios.

Method: SheafAlign employs sheaf structures for pairwise modality relations and decentralized contrastive learning objectives for training, avoiding the need for mutual redundancy.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance in zero-shot generalization, cross-modal alignment, robustness to missing modalities, and achieves a significant reduction in communication cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SheafAlign effectively addresses the limitations of existing multimodal alignment methods by preserving both shared and unique information across modalities.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zero-shot RL aims to train agents that can solve tasks without additional training at test-time, resembling foundation models in vision and language. This paper introduces a unified framework to analyze and categorize approaches in zero-shot RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of zero-shot reinforcement learning lacks a consistent analytical framework for researching and developing general-purpose agents capable of solving tasks immediately without fine-tuning.

Method: The paper organizes existing zero-shot RL approaches into a unified framework, classifying algorithms into direct and compositional representations, and introduces new extended bounds for successor-feature methods.

Result: The authors provide an analytical lens that organizes prior work in zero-shot RL and offer theoretical insights into successor-feature methods' performance.

Conclusion: The unified framework serves as a foundation for advancing zero-shot RL research, aiming to simplify the comparison of methods and pave the path toward creating highly general agents.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

TL;DR: The paper examines graph rewiring techniques in GNNs and Graph Transformers, exploring how they impact graph structure and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rewiring techniques improve information flow in GNNs but may distort important graph structural properties. The paper seeks to identify key structural metrics that should be preserved.

Method: The authors analyze seven rewiring strategies and compare their effects on node classification accuracy and local/global graph properties.

Result: The study finds that successful rewiring approaches preserve local structure while allowing for changes in global connectivity.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that retaining local graph properties is crucial for effective rewiring and practical GNN optimization.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integration of MLOps practices into OT systems in industrial settings is complex due to fundamental obstacles, thereby necessitating structured methodologies for alignment.

Method: Analyzed existing OT reference models (RAMI 4.0 and ISA-95) and mapped MLOps lifecycle components to these models, exemplified using a real-world use case.

Result: Demonstrated that MLOps practices cannot be directly applied to OT systems, but leveraging structured adaptations using reference models can enable successful integration.

Conclusion: Using established OT reference models as a framework allows systematic integration of MLOps practices into OT systems in industrial environments.

Abstract: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices are increas- ingly adopted in

systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic

evaluate the suitability of the Reference Architectural Model for Industry 4.0

MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-

Result: The method demonstrates improved generalization capabilities and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reasoning tasks of higher complexity.

Conclusion: The research validates that compositional energy landscapes and PEM are effective in reasoning generalization, enabling enhanced performance on complex problems while maintaining flexibility for scalability.

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

### [275] [Convergence Analysis of SGD under Expected Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20608)
*Yuta Kawamoto,Hideaki Iiduka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a convergence analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under the Expected Smoothness (ES) framework, refining assumptions and deriving explicit convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical analyses of SGD rely on restrictive assumptions (e.g., bounded variance or uniform noise), which limit their flexibility and realism. The ES condition offers a more versatile alternative to address these shortcomings.

Method: The authors refine the ES condition with improved interpretations and constants, derive bounds on the expected squared full gradient norm, and establish $O(1/K)$ convergence rates with explicit residual errors for different step-size schedules.

Result: They provide detailed proofs demonstrating improved convergence rates under the refined ES condition and unification of recent efforts in SGD analysis.

Conclusion: The paper extends and generalizes prior work, showing the utility of ES in analyzing SGD's convergence, while addressing the limitations of classical assumptions more effectively.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

*Timur Galimzyanov,Olga Kolomyttseva,Egor Bogomolov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores code-focused retrieval design for tasks like code completion and bug localization, assessing various methods to optimize retrieval under realistic computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify optimal retrieval strategies for code-related tasks by balancing effectiveness and computational efficiency across different configurations and context sizes.

Method: A systematic comparison of retrieval configurations is conducted across variables like chunking strategy, similarity scoring, and splitting granularity, using tasks from Long Code Arena.

Result: Sparse BM25 proves superior for PL-PL retrieval with word-level splitting. NL-PL retrieval benefits most from dense encoders despite higher latency. Chunk size and retrieval latency significantly affect performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for efficient and effective code-oriented retrieval-augmented generation systems tailored to task-specific and computational requirements.

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of traditional breast cancer diagnostic methods, such as variability, cost, and risk of misdiagnosis, by leveraging machine learning for early and accurate diagnosis.

Method: The researchers developed an integrated framework incorporating customized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. They evaluated the framework on 29 models, including classical classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms, and instance-based algorithms, and employed cross-validation and explainable AI techniques.

Result: The proposed framework achieved a superior score of 99.1% across all key performance metrics such as accuracy and precision. Additionally, it effectively reduced dimensionality and provided transparent, model-agnostic explanations.

Conclusion: Integrating swarm intelligence with explainable machine learning can enable robust, reliable, and clinically relevant diagnostic tools for breast cancer detection, demonstrating significant potential for implementation in medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

*Yang Han,Pengyu Wang,Kai Yu,Xin Chen,Lu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MS-BART, a framework for mass spectrometry that uses large-scale pretraining to overcome challenges of data scarcity and raw spectral signal complexity, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mass spectrometry faces challenges in molecular identification due to limited annotated spectra and complex spectral signals. There is a need for methods to address data scarcity and improve analysis efficiency.

Method: MS-BART uses a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary for cross-modal learning through large-scale pretraining. It employs multi-task pretraining, finetuning with fingerprint predictions, and chemical feedback mechanisms to improve alignment and robustness.

Result: MS-BART obtains SOTA performance in 5 out of 12 metrics across two benchmarks and operates significantly faster than competing methods, validated through comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies.

Conclusion: MS-BART is an effective solution for tackling data scarcity and complexity in MS data analysis, offering improved performance and efficiency over existing methods.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

*Aki Rehn,Linzh Zhao,Mikko A. Heikkilä,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates differentially private transfer learning, focusing on hyperparameters clipping bound (C) and batch size (B), revealing mismatches and inefficiencies in existing tuning practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the effectiveness of differentially private transfer learning, particularly in selecting and using hyperparameters like clipping bound and batch size.

Method: The authors conducted empirical analysis on gradient distributions, cumulative DP noise, and performance outcomes under varying privacy constraints and compute budgets.

Result: They discovered a mismatch between theoretical guidelines and empirical performance for hyperparameter tuning, identified inadequacies in existing heuristics, and highlighted inefficiencies in using fixed hyperparameter settings.

Conclusion: Optimal hyperparameter selection in differentially private transfer learning requires task-specific configurations to improve performance, especially when moving between different privacy and compute settings.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

### [280] [H-SPLID: HSIC-based Saliency Preserving Latent Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20627)
*Lukas Miklautz,Chengzhi Shi,Andrii Shkabrii,Theodoros Thirimachos Davarakis,Prudence Lam,Claudia Plant,Jennifer Dy,Stratis Ioannidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-SPLID, an algorithm designed for effective feature representation by separating salient and non-salient features. It enhances robustness and compresses latent representation according to task-relevant dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve robustness in machine learning models and promote efficient feature learning by decomposing salient and non-salient features.

Method: H-SPLID explicitly divides salient and non-salient features into separate subspaces, with a theoretical connection between robustness, dimensionality reduction, and input-output relationships using HSIC.

Result: Evaluations show that H-SPLID-trained models focus on salient features, resulting in less sensitivity to non-important perturbations like image backgrounds.

Conclusion: H-SPLID advances robustness and efficiency for feature representation in machine learning, validated by theoretical and empirical results. Its implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

*Mingxuan Liu,Yilin Ning,Haoyuan Wang,Chuan Hong,Matthew Engelhard,Danielle S. Bitterman,William G. La Cava,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM) to address algorithmic bias and improve equity in survival analysis, using breast cancer prognosis as an example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural inequities and biases in clinical data can be perpetuated by machine learning models in healthcare, especially impacting survival analysis due to censoring and time dynamics.

Method: The authors propose the FASM framework to reduce intra-group and cross-group bias in survival modeling, ensuring stable fairness over time while preserving discrimination performance.

Result: FASM improves fairness significantly over a 10-year follow-up period using SEER data, particularly during the mid-term, while maintaining comparable discrimination capabilities.

Conclusion: FASM enables the development of survival models that balance accuracy with equity, prioritizing fairness as a fundamental principle in clinical decision-making.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of large language and multimodal models (LLMs/LMMs) for 6G autonomous communication systems, demonstrating their superiority over traditional methods through case studies and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Harnessing the advanced capabilities of LLMs and LMMs, the paper aims to address the growing need for robust, task-oriented, and adaptive autonomous communication systems for 6G technologies involving machines, vehicles, and humanoids.

Method: The authors propose a framework utilizing LLMs/LMMs with integration of multimodal sensing, adaptive reconfiguration, and customized prompt/fine-tuning strategies. They validate the approach through case studies including traffic control, robot scheduling, and channel estimation.

Result: Experimental results show that LLM/LMM-driven systems outperform traditional deep learning models, proving their robustness under dynamic objectives, varying conditions, and multimodal scenarios.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLM/LMMs hold immense potential in implementing efficient and robust 6G autonomous communication systems, surpassing limitations faced by conventional optimization and deep learning methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BadGraph, a backdoor attack targeting text-guided graph generation models using latent diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked security vulnerabilities in text-guided graph generation models using latent diffusion methods.

Method: BadGraph utilizes textual triggers to poison training data, inducing attacker-specific subgraphs during inference, while maintaining standard performance on clean samples.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show a high attack success rate with low poisoning rates and minimal impact on clean sample performance.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, demanding robust defensive mechanisms especially for critical applications like drug discovery.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

TL;DR: The paper presents DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity recommendation framework to optimize the monitoring of cloud services, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of recommending optimal cloud service attributes to monitor despite limited structural and engagement data, which affects traditional approaches negatively.

Method: DiRecGNN leverages multi-head attention inspired by transformer architectures to focus on neighbors and their attributes, incorporate random walk paths to capture long-range dependencies, and optimize using multi-faceted loss functions.

Result: DiRecGNN shows a 43.1% increase in MRR over traditional methods, proving its effectiveness through empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: This framework significantly improves entity recommendation for cloud services and is well-regarded by product teams, emphasizing its practical utility.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes optimizing the LASER method for adapting large language models without fine-tuning by focusing on selected weight matrices and employing alternative, efficient techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency and impracticality of LASER's exhaustive per-matrix search while maintaining its ability to improve downstream accuracy without fine-tuning.

Method: Identifying critical weight matrices using singular value gradients, employing clustering-based factorization techniques to reduce overfitting and enhance accuracy, and utilizing small sample sizes for faster evaluation and adaptation.

Result: Accuracy improved up to 24.6 percentage points, with reduced computational overhead by eliminating exhaustive per-matrix search and minimizing the required dataset size for evaluation.

Conclusion: The findings enable a rapid and efficient adaptation of LLMs to downstream tasks without gradient-based fine-tuning, showcasing a robust method using minimal computation and data.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

*Reuben Dorent,Polina Golland,William Wells III*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on mutual information (MI) using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), demonstrating its effectiveness in MI estimation and representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The connection between alternative dependence measures like JSD and mutual information (MI) remains unclear, necessitating a more robust theoretical and practical understanding.

Method: The authors derive a tight lower bound on Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) using JSD and specialize it for joint and marginal distributions. They also revisit JSD-based objectives, showing their connection to variational lower bounds on mutual information through cross-entropy loss minimization.

Result: The proposed lower bound provides a stable and low-variance estimate of MI. Experiments show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art neural estimators, with applications in scenarios like the Information Bottleneck framework.

Conclusion: The paper offers theoretical insights and empirical validation for using discriminative learning in MI-based representation learning, advancing the understanding and practical implementation of mutual information estimation.

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

TL;DR: The paper presents xTime, a new framework enhancing extreme event forecasting by using knowledge distillation and a mixture of experts, achieving up to 78% improved accuracy for rare events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting extreme events in time series data, such as floods, heatwaves, or medical episodes, critical for fields like climate science and healthcare.

Method: xTime utilizes knowledge distillation to transfer insights across models trained on events of varying rarity levels and employs a mixture of experts to dynamically combine outputs from specialized models.

Result: xTime demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving accuracy gains on extreme events ranging from 3% to 78% in experiments using multiple datasets.

Conclusion: This study introduces an innovative and effective approach to extreme event forecasting in time series, showcasing substantial advancements in prediction accuracy—especially for rare and impactful occurrences.

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Luis González-Gudiño,Tales Imbiriba,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid Bayesian model to enhance GNSS jamming localization and signal reconstruction in urban areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS signals are prone to jamming and inaccuracies in urban environments due to multipath and shadowing effects, creating challenges for accurate signal localization and reconstruction.

Method: A hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework combining a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) using log-linear pooling. Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation estimates both jammer position and signal strength with uncertainty.

Result: The proposed framework improves localization accuracy and reduces uncertainty, particularly when more training points are available. The uncertainty is concentrated around the jammer and urban canyons.

Conclusion: The hybrid model effectively leverages both physical and machine learning techniques to provide accurate GNSS jammer localization and signal reconstruction in urban settings, with detailed uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

TL;DR: The paper is a guide on building world models with a focused exploration of their evolution, skipping unrelated branches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear guide for building world models, tracing their development while focusing on core elements.

Method: The paper traces the development from masked models, unified architectures, interactive generative models, and memory-augmented systems.

Result: The work identifies a focused and promising developmental path for achieving true world models.

Conclusion: By following the clear evolution of world models, the paper highlights the potential for advanced generative, interactive, and memory-driven systems as a roadmap for progress.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

*Subham Kumar,Prakrithi Shivaprakash,Koustav Rudra,Lekhansh Shukla,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph neural network (GRACE) framework for predicting the locus of care for addiction patients, addressing challenges with class imbalances in addiction datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for automating the locus of care decisions for addiction patients due to insufficient specialized treatment resources like inpatient beds or staff.

Method: The authors developed a GRACE framework using extensive feature engineering and a novel unbiased meta-graph to train a Graph Neural Network (GNN), overcoming the issue of class imbalances in addiction datasets.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated an improvement of 11-35% in the F1 score of the minority class compared to competitive baselines using real-world data.

Conclusion: The GRACE framework provides an effective automated solution for locus of care prediction for addiction patients and significantly improves treatment outcomes and resource utilization in healthcare systems.

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and

### [291] [A Scalable, Causal, and Energy Efficient Framework for Neural Decoding with Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20683)
*Georgios Mentzelopoulos,Ioannis Asmanis,Konrad P. Kording,Eva L. Dyer,Kostas Daniilidis,Flavia Vitale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spikachu, a spiking neural network-based framework for real-time, energy-efficient neural decoding. It processes neural activity for applications like speech and prosthetic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in neural decoders for brain-computer interfaces that are either too simple to generalize well or too power-demanding for real-world use, and highlights the potential of spiking neural networks.

Method: The authors developed Spikachu, which processes binned neural spikes into a latent space, extracts relevant features with spiking modules, and generates behavioral predictions. They evaluated it on data from 6 non-human primates.

Result: Spikachu outperformed causal baselines in accuracy while using significantly less energy (2.26 to 418.81 times less), and demonstrated scalability to multiple sessions and few-shot transfer to new tasks.

Conclusion: Spikachu provides a scalable, causal, online-compatible decoding framework with competitive performance and significantly reduced energy consumption, suitable for real-world brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

### [292] [Optimizing Clinical Fall Risk Prediction: A Data-Driven Integration of EHR Variables with the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20714)
*Fardin Ganjkhanloo,Emmett Springer,Erik H. Hoyer,Daniel L. Young,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study refines the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) using a new data-driven model, achieving higher prediction accuracy for inpatient fall risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High fall risks among inpatients are an ongoing clinical challenge, prompting the need to enhance the accuracy and efficacy of fall risk assessment methods.

Method: The authors applied constrained score optimization (CSO) models to improve JHFRAT prediction performance, utilizing assessment data and electronic health record (EHR) variables.

Result: The CSO model achieved significant improvement over the traditional JHFRAT tool (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91 vs. JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86), with similar results observed regardless of the inclusion of EHR data.

Conclusion: The newly developed CSO model provides greater accuracy and robustness in fall risk prediction, offering healthcare systems a scalable solution to enhance fall prevention and allocate resources effectively.

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

### [293] [Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718)
*Daniel Sorensen,Bappaditya Dey,Minjin Hwang,Sandip Halder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two approaches for predicting anomalies in semiconductor manufacturing using forecasting models, with a focus on addressing challenges such as high data dimensionality and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semiconductor fabrication faces challenges in real-time fault detection due to high dimensional and imbalanced sensor data, alongside complex interdependencies between variables that hinder prediction and analysis.

Method: The paper proposes a framework with two stages: training forecasting models (N-BEATS and GNN) on anomaly-free data and using forecasts to identify anomalies in unseen data by analyzing deviations from thresholds.

Result: The Graph Neural Network (GNN) outperforms N-BEATS in forecasting accuracy and anomaly detection efficiency, requiring fewer parameters and computational cost while achieving stable predictions over longer horizons.

Conclusion: The GNN model is a robust tool for real-time anomaly prediction in semiconductor manufacturing, offering better performance and efficiency, facilitating proactive fault prevention in complex industrial settings.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

*Jan Sobotka,Luca Baroni,Ján Antolík*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEIcoder, a decoding method that effectively reconstructs visual stimuli from neural data, even in scenarios with limited data, and proposes a benchmark to advance research in neural decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in decoding visual stimuli from limited neural population data, particularly in settings where high-throughput recording is impractical.

Method: MEIcoder utilizes neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity loss measure, and adversarial training to decode visual stimuli from neural activity.

Result: MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing visual stimuli, excelling in scenarios with small datasets (e.g., fewer neurons or samples) and achieves high-fidelity results with as few as 1,000–2,500 neurons and <1,000 training samples.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of MEIcoder for reliable visual decoding in early visual systems and offers a new benchmark dataset to support further research in neuroscience and neuroengineering.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

*Jasmine Bayrooti,Sattar Vakili,Amanda Prorok,Carl Henrik Ek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Thompson Sampling in Reinforcement Learning with Gaussian process priors, offering theoretical no-regret guarantees and deriving a regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling has been effective in sequential decision-making but lacks rigorous theoretical foundations, especially in Reinforcement Learning scenarios.

Method: The authors employ episodic Reinforcement Learning with joint Gaussian process priors over rewards and transitions, leveraging tools such as the elliptical potential lemma adapted for multi-output settings.

Result: They derive a regret bound of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes with horizon $H$, considering model complexity.

Conclusion: The study strengthens understanding of TS in Reinforcement Learning, showing its performance depends on structural assumptions and model uncertainty.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

*Yujia Zheng,Zhuokai Zhao,Zijian Li,Yaqi Xie,Mingze Gao,Lizhu Zhang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel paradigm, 'thought communication,' enabling direct 'mind-to-mind' interaction between agents, akin to telepathy, and develops a theoretical framework that recovers shared and private latent thoughts to improve collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language, while beneficial for human cooperation, carries inherent limitations such as ambiguity, lossy communication, and indirectness, hindering optimized collective intelligence. Machines have potential to overcome these constraints.

Method: The paper formalizes thought communication using a latent variable model to extract and identify shared and private latent thoughts between agents. The proposed framework recovers latent thoughts and their structural relationships with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theoretical model and demonstrate improved collaboration through thought communication.

Conclusion: The work presents thought communication as a paradigm beyond natural language for agent interaction, highlighting its potential to address challenges unsolvable through traditional approaches reliant on language or surface-level observation.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

*Tsai Hor Chan,Feng Wu,Yihang Chen,Guosheng Yin,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a DP-driven multimodal learning framework to improve feature expressiveness and cross-modal interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches focus excessively on cross-modal alignment, which restricts meaningful representation learning within each modality.

Method: The proposed framework uses a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model to dynamically allocate feature weights and select prominent features for better fusion.

Result: Experiments on multiple multimodal datasets demonstrate the model's superior performance and robust alignment capabilities compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The DP-driven framework achieves optimal balance in multimodal learning, effectively facilitating feature fusion while ensuring robustness and flexibility.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

*Anna Mészáros,Patrik Reizinger,Ferenc Huszár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the capability of Transformers trained as chess players to systematically generalize and adhere to the rules of chess, performing well on out-of-distribution scenarios and Chess960 challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the extent to which decision Transformers trained like large language models can understand chess rules and exhibit robust systematic generalization.

Method: A 270M parameter chess Transformer was trained and evaluated on out-of-distribution scenarios and Chess960, along with observing its training dynamics.

Result: The chess Transformer demonstrated compositional generalization by selecting valid moves even in unfamiliar situations and exhibited decent strategy adaptation for Chess960 scenarios. It initially learned to move only its own pieces, implying emergent understanding.

Conclusion: Transformers show strong adherence to chess rules and compositional reasoning but fall short against symbolic AI algorithms in complex variants like Chess960, though the performance gap is narrower against human users.

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of reverse/forward KL regularization in reinforcement learning with language models, challenging commonly held beliefs about mode seeking vs. mass covering. It proposes a scalable algorithm optimizing for target distributions with diverse modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard assumptions about reverse and forward KL not aligning with 'mode seeking' and 'mass covering' prompts a deeper inquiry into how these divergences interact in reinforcement learning tasks, especially in the context of language models.

Method: The authors analyze the mathematical and empirical characteristics of KL divergence in reinforcement learning, adjust reward magnitudes, and propose a scalable algorithm to optimize for diverse target distributions across multiple modes.

Result: Their method achieves improved solution quality and diversity in post-training of both Large Language Models and Chemical Language Models, even outperforming naive approaches to forward/reverse KL regularization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that reverse and forward KL regularization don't inherently determine mode coverage, but that proper regularization settings can result in diverse and high-quality target distributions. The proposed algorithm demonstrates practical improvements in various models without relying on external diversity signals.

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

*James C. Knight,Johanna Senk,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new GPU-accelerated framework for implementing structural plasticity rules, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements in sparse SNN classifiers and topographic map formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in current machine learning frameworks which fail to optimize training costs for sparse neural network connectivity, inspired by structural plasticity observed in biological brains.

Method: The paper outlines a flexible GPU-accelerated framework designed for implementing structural plasticity rules and utilizes it to train sparse SNN classifiers via the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R in both supervised and unsupervised contexts.

Result: Sparse SNN classifiers achieved a 10x reduction in training time compared to dense models without compromising performance. Real-time efficient topographic map formation and sparsity benefits are showcased.

Conclusion: The framework advances research into sparse network structures, enabling efficient training, maintaining sparsity, and unlocking computational benefits in neuromorphic applications.

Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity,
where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections.
However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections
are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning
but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by
structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak
connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of
inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for
backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce
the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports
efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational
neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework
for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate
this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train
efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning
context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our
sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring
enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate
topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights
into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network
size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and
maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as
exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic
applications.

*Mostapha Kalami Heris*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'Prompt Decorators,' a declarative syntax for controlling LLM behavior using compact tokens, improving reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users of LLMs lack consistent control over reasoning and output expression, and conventional prompt engineering methods are verbose and restrict clarity and reproducibility.

Method: The paper introduces a syntax-based framework using compact decorators (e.g., +++Reasoning) to adjust behavioral dimensions like tone and reasoning style. It formalizes twenty core decorators, a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic pipeline.

Result: Illustrative use cases show improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and standardized behavior across domains.

Conclusion: Prompt Decorators establish a reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design, enabling interoperable and consistent behavior for scalable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

*Assaf Marron,David Harel*

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of a 'realm' for algorithm specifications, summarizing the prerequisite knowledge needed for executing an algorithm. It also discusses tools and methods for creating such realms and assessing execution faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a systematic way to define and analyze the prerequisite knowledge for executing algorithm specifications, ensuring clarity and enabling mechanical execution by humans or machines.

Method: The authors propose the creation of a document called the 'realm,' which organizes necessary knowledge, leveraging large language models and document reuse for automation.

Result: This method enables a detailed categorization of knowledge required for algorithm execution and opens pathways for systematic implementation and formal mechanical verification.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of summarizing prerequisite knowledge for algorithm execution and highlights its potential impact on methodology, automation, and execution faithfulness.

Abstract: An algorithm specification in natural language or pseudocode is expected to
be clear and explicit enough to enable mechanical execution. In this position
paper we contribute an initial characterization of the knowledge that an
executing agent, human or machine, should possess in order to be able to carry
out the instructions of a given algorithm specification as a stand-alone
entity, independent of any system implementation. We argue that, for that
algorithm specification, such prerequisite knowledge, whether unique or shared
with other specifications, can be summarized in a document of practical size.
We term this document the realm of the algorithm specification. The generation
of such a realm is itself a systematic analytical process, significant parts of
which can be automated with the help of large language models and the reuse of
existing documents. The algorithm-specification's realm would consist of
specification language syntax and semantics, domain knowledge restricted to the
referenced entities, inter-entity relationships, relevant underlying
cause-and-effect rules, and detailed instructions and means for carrying out
certain operations. Such characterization of the realm can contribute to
methodological implementation of the algorithm specification in diverse systems
and to its formalization for mechanical verification. The paper also touches
upon the question of assessing execution faithfulness, which is distinct from
correctness: in the absence of a reference interpretation of natural language
or pseudocode specification with a given vocabulary, how can we determine if an
observed agent's execution indeed complies with the input specification.

### [303] [Deconstructed Proto-Quipper: A Rational Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20018)
*Ryan Kavanagh,Chuta Sano,Brigitte Pientka*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Proto-Quipper-A simplifies the complex semantics of Proto-Quipper languages by introducing adjoint-logical foundations for static quantum circuit generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum programming languages like Quipper need a solid foundation. Proto-Quipper languages attempt this but have overly complex semantics, making reasoning and mechanization difficult.

Method: The paper introduces Proto-Quipper-A, a reconstruction leveraging a linear λ-calculus and adjoint-logical foundations to simplify circuit representation and programming abstractions.

Result: Proto-Quipper-A provides a simpler call-by-value reduction semantics and demonstrates normalization using logical relations.

Conclusion: This approach makes Proto-Quipper-A a tractable foundation by resolving key complexities, enabling easier reasoning and integration with functional programming.

Abstract: The Proto-Quipper family of programming languages aims to provide a formal
foundation for the Quipper quantum programming language. Unfortunately,
Proto-Quipper languages have complex operational semantics: they are inherently
effectful, and they rely on set-theoretic operations and fresh name generation
to manipulate quantum circuits. This makes them difficult to reason about using
standard programming language techniques and, ultimately, to mechanize. We
introduce Proto-Quipper-A, a rational reconstruction of Proto-Quipper languages
for static circuit generation. It uses a linear $\lambda$-calculus to describe
quantum circuits with normal forms that closely correspond to box-and-wire
circuit diagrams. Adjoint-logical foundations integrate this circuit language
with a linear/non-linear functional language and let us reconstruct
Proto-Quipper's circuit programming abstractions using more primitive
adjoint-logical operations. Proto-Quipper-A enjoys a simple call-by-value
reduction semantics, and to illustrate its tractability as a foundation for
Proto-Quipper languages, we show that it is normalizing. We show how to use
standard logical relations to prove normalization of linear and substructural
systems, thereby avoiding the inherent complexity of existing linear logical
relations.

*Patrycja Balik,Szymon Jędras,Piotr Polesiuk*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an effect inference algorithm for type-and-effect systems with features like subtyping, higher-rank polymorphism, and set-like semantics, enhancing expressiveness and intuitiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Type-and-effect systems are underutilized due to complexity and compromises in existing inference algorithms.

Method: The authors propose transforming effect constraints into propositional logic formulas to tackle higher-rank polymorphism scoping issues, ensuring soundness and completeness.

Result: The algorithm was formalized in the Rocq proof assistant and successfully implemented in a realistic programming language.

Conclusion: This new algorithm advances type-and-effect systems by balancing expressiveness, intuitiveness, and computational feasibility.

Abstract: Type-and-effect systems help the programmer to organize data and
computational effects in a program. While for traditional type systems
expressive variants with sophisticated inference algorithms have been developed
and widely used in programming languages, type-and-effect systems did not yet
gain widespread adoption. One reason for this is that type-and-effect systems
are more complex and the existing inference algorithms make compromises between
expressiveness, intuitiveness, and decidability. In this work, we present an
effect inference algorithm for a type-and-effect system with subtyping,
expressive higher-rank polymorphism, and intuitive set-like semantics of
effects. In order to deal with scoping issues of higher-rank polymorphism, we
delay solving of effect constraints by transforming them into formulae of
propositional logic. We prove soundness and completeness of our algorithm with
respect to a declarative type-and-effect system. All the presented results have
been formalized in the Rocq proof assistant, and the algorithm has been
successfully implemented in a realistic programming language.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper presents a compilation scheme for Mimosa programming, integrating real-time OS primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt Lustre compilation schemes for Mimosa programming language, specifically for embedded systems.

Method: Formal adaptation of Lustre's compilation scheme to Mimosa semantics and mapping coordination layers to OS primitives.

Result: Successful integration of Mimosa's time-triggered processes with real-time operating system primitives.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme enhances the Mimosa programming language's application in embedded systems using real-time OS.

Abstract: This paper introduces a compilation scheme for programs written in the Mimosa
programming language, which builds upon the MIMOS model of computation. Mimosa
describes embedded systems software as a collection of time-triggered processes
which communicate through FIFO queues. We formally describe an adaptation of
the Lustre compilation scheme to the semantics of Mimosa and show how the
coordination layer can be mapped to real-time operating system primitives.

*Oliver Braunsdorf,Tim Lange,Konrad Hohentanner,Julian Horsch,Johannes Kinder*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: SafeFFI optimizes memory safety checks in Rust programs by targeting the boundary between safe and unsafe code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of redundant memory safety checks in Rust programs caused by interaction between the unsafe code and the Rust type system.

Method: SafeFFI optimizes memory safety instrumentation by reducing sanitizer checks at the boundary of unsafe and safe code without requiring whole-program analysis.

Result: SafeFFI reduces sanitizer checks by up to 98%, provides a much lower compile-time overhead, and maintains correctness in detecting memory safety violations.

Conclusion: SafeFFI successfully balances efficient memory safety instrumentation with reduced performance overhead, outperforming existing systems in tackling memory safety violations.

Abstract: Unsafe Rust code is necessary for interoperability with C/C++ libraries and
implementing low-level data structures, but it can cause memory safety
violations in otherwise memory-safe Rust programs. Sanitizers can catch such
memory errors at runtime, but introduce many unnecessary checks even for memory
accesses guaranteed safe by the Rust type system. We introduce SafeFFI, a
system for optimizing memory safety instrumentation in Rust binaries such that
checks occur at the boundary between unsafe and safe code, handing over the
enforcement of memory safety from the sanitizer to the Rust type system. Unlike
previous approaches, our design avoids expensive whole-program analysis and
adds much less compile-time overhead (2.64x compared to over 8.83x). On a
collection of popular Rust crates and known vulnerable Rust code, SafeFFI
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing
sanitizer checks by up to 98%, while maintaining correctness and flagging all
spatial and temporal memory safety violations.

### [307] [Configuration-Dependent Robot Kinematics Model and Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19962)
*Chen-Lung Lu,Honglu He,Agung Julius,John T. Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Improves robot kinematic accuracy by calibrating configuration-dependent discrepancies using a local POE model and Fourier interpolation, achieving sub-millimeter precision and higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often experience configuration-dependent model discrepancies leading to reduced kinematic accuracy, critical for tasks requiring precise tool placement.

Method: The authors used local POE (Product-of-Exponential) models at multiple configurations and Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized by joint angles to create a global model. This method is efficient while maintaining accuracy.

Result: The proposed calibration reduced positioning error by over 50%, achieving sub-millimeter precision, validated on two 6-DoF robots, notably benefiting robots with larger discrepancies.

Conclusion: The framework improves workspace-wide positioning accuracy effectively with high efficiency and demonstrated practical usability in precision tasks like cold spray manufacturing.

Abstract: Accurate robot kinematics is essential for precise tool placement in
articulated robots, but non-geometric factors can introduce
configuration-dependent model discrepancies. This paper presents a
configuration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy
across the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,
selected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple
configurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity
load expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized
by the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural
network and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training
efficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed
approach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the
sub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with
larger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot
collaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and
repeatability.

*Hien Bui,Yufeiyang Gao,Haoran Yang,Eric Cui,Siddhant Mody,Brian Acosta,Thomas Stephen Felix,Bibit Bianchini,Michael Posa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an advancement in robotics focusing on non-prehensile object manipulation using an optimized control algorithm called C3+, achieving efficient and precise outcomes in complex multi-object tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects in robotics, particularly due to complex contact interactions and unknown physical properties.

Method: The paper introduces an improved algorithm named Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+) for Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control (CI-MPC), incorporating optimized trajectory optimization and integrated system components including object scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution.

Result: The new algorithm achieves faster computation speeds and real-time performance, demonstrated by a 98% success rate on hardware across 33 objects in multi-object planar pushing tasks with varying completion times.

Conclusion: C3+ significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of CI-MPC, demonstrating its potential to address challenges in multi-object, contact-rich manipulation tasks with high precision and success rates.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation of diverse objects remains a core challenge in
robotics, driven by unknown physical properties and the complexity of
contact-rich interactions. Recent advances in contact-implicit model predictive
control (CI-MPC), with contact reasoning embedded directly in the trajectory
optimization, have shown promise in tackling the task efficiently and robustly,
yet demonstrations have been limited to narrowly curated examples. In this
work, we showcase the broader capabilities of CI-MPC through precise planar
pushing tasks over a wide range of object geometries, including multi-object
domains. These scenarios demand reasoning over numerous inter-object and
object-environment contacts to strategically manipulate and de-clutter the
environment, challenges that were intractable for prior CI-MPC methods. To
achieve this, we introduce Consensus Complementarity Control Plus (C3+), an
enhanced CI-MPC algorithm integrated into a complete pipeline spanning object
scanning, mesh reconstruction, and hardware execution. Compared to its
predecessor C3, C3+ achieves substantially faster solve times, enabling
real-time performance even in multi-object pushing tasks. On hardware, our
system achieves overall 98% success rate across 33 objects, reaching pose goals
within tight tolerances. The average time-to-goal is approximately 0.5, 1.6,
3.2, and 5.3 minutes for 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-object tasks, respectively. Project

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for UAVs to learn generalizable minimum-time flight policies for navigating between arbitrary states efficiently and robustly, validated through simulations and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV policies lack adaptability to arbitrary start and goal states and are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting their practical application.

Method: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework using Point Mass Model trajectories as proxy rewards and curriculum learning to facilitate efficient training and improve generalization.

Result: Simulation tests show superior performance against NMPC methods and highlight the benefits of curriculum learning. Real-world experiments demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the learned policies in outdoor settings using minimal computational resources.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the limitations of UAV navigation by presenting a robust, generalizable, and computationally efficient reinforcement learning-driven flight policy for diverse environments.

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of learning a generalizable minimum-time
flight policy for UAVs, capable of navigating between arbitrary start and goal
states while balancing agile flight and stable hovering. Traditional
approaches, particularly in autonomous drone racing, achieve impressive speeds
and agility but are constrained to predefined track layouts, limiting
real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a reinforcement
learning-based framework that simultaneously learns state-to-state minimum-time
planning and control and generalizes to arbitrary state-to-state flights. Our
approach leverages Point Mass Model (PMM) trajectories as proxy rewards to
approximate the true optimal flight objective and employs curriculum learning
to scale the training process efficiently and to achieve generalization. We
validate our method through simulation experiments, comparing it against
Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) tracking PMM-generated trajectories
and conducting ablation studies to assess the impact of curriculum learning.
Finally, real-world experiments confirm the robustness of our learned policy in
outdoor environments, demonstrating its ability to generalize and operate on a
small ARM-based single-board computer.

*Sourabh Karmakar,Apurva Patel,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper reviews methodologies for calibrating Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic Machines (PKM), emphasizing inverse kinematics over forward kinematics for improved accuracy and ease in calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for precise micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space through accurate calibration of 6-DOF PKM robots, essential for critical applications like medical devices and space research.

Method: The study reviews external instrument-based, constraint-based, and auto/self-calibration approaches for inverse kinematics-based calibration of PKM.

Result: Researchers have primarily focused on improving position and orientation accuracy of PKMs by considering structural and environmental error sources in no-load conditions.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of inverse kinematics for accurate PKM calibration and encourages further exploration of calibration techniques to address error sources under more realistic conditions.

Abstract: Stewart platform-based Parallel Kinematic (PKM) Machines have been
extensively studied by researchers due to their inherent finer control
characteristics. This has opened its potential deployment opportunities in
versatile critical applications like the medical field, engineering machines,
space research, electronic chip manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, etc.
All these precise, complicated, and repeatable motion applications require
micro and nano-scale movement control in 3D space; a 6-DOF PKM can take this
challenge smartly. For this, the PKM must be more accurate than the desired
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a PKM robot is
essential. Forward kinematics-based calibration for such hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To analyze different techniques, an external instrument-based,
constraint-based, and auto or self-calibration-based approaches have been used
for calibration. This survey has been done by reviewing these key
methodologies, their outcome, and important points related to inverse
kinematic-based PKM calibrations in general. It is observed in this study that
the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position and
orientation considering the errors contributed by a single source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly structural, in some cases,
environmental factors are also considered, however, these calibrations are done
under no-load conditions. This study aims to understand the current state of
the art in this field and to expand the scope for other researchers in further
exploration in a specific area.

*Travis A. Roberts,Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of a custom polymer Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing platform tailored for research, with precise control features, environmental monitoring, and in-situ photogrammetry capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of consumer and commercial-grade 3D printers, which lack necessary features for research such as flexibility for modifications and precision parameter control.

Method: The authors designed and fabricated a research-focused FDM platform with tight control/monitoring over process parameters, incorporating closed-loop feedback, environmental controls, and integrated photogrammetry. A novel heated bed spinning mechanism was also introduced.

Result: The resulting 3D printing platform supports accurate, repeatable experiments by allowing researchers to link process parameters with geometric defects. The photogrammetry system reduces the required number of cameras while enhancing geometric defect analysis.

Conclusion: The developed platform is a versatile tool for 3D printing research, enabling controlled parameter testing and defect analysis with innovative photogrammetric features.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, is a complex process that creates
free-form geometric objects by sequentially placing material to construct an
object, usually in a layer-by-layer process. One of the most widely used
methods is Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). FDM is used in many of the
consumer-grade polymer 3D printers available today. While consumer grade
machines are cheap and plentiful, they lack many of the features desired in a
machine used for research purposes and are often closed-source platforms.
Commercial-grade models are more expensive and are also usually closed-source
platforms that do not offer flexibility for modifications often needed for
research. The authors designed and fabricated a machine to be used as a test
bed for research in the field of polymer FDM processes. The goal was to create
a platform that tightly controls and/or monitors the FDM build parameters so
that experiments can be repeated with a known accuracy. The platform offers
closed loop position feedback, control of the hot end and bed temperature, and
monitoring of environment temperature and humidity. Additionally, the platform
is equipped with cameras and a mechanism for in-situ photogrammetry, creating a
geometric record of the printing throughout the printing process. Through
photogrammetry, backtracking and linking process parameters to observable
geometric defects can be achieved. This paper focuses on the design of a novel
mechanism for spinning the heated bed to allow for photogrammetric
reconstruction of the printed part using a minimal number of cameras, as
implemented on this platform.

*Ahmed Alanazi,Duy Ho,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Path-based Transformer model for robotic arm trajectory planning, achieving high task success rates and showing promise for sim-to-real manipulation applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional sequence models for robotic arms, which often fail in trajectory planning due to ignoring motion structure.

Method: The paper utilizes a Path-based Transformer with a 3-grid representation (where, what, when) and constraint-masked decoding to ensure motion validity and workspace boundaries while reasoning over task graphs.

Result: The model showed high accuracy in trajectory alignment (89.44% stepwise accuracy, 90.40% F1) and robust performance in real-world tests with success rates of up to 97.5% for reach and 86.7% in end-to-end tasks.

Conclusion: Path-structured representations can enhance Transformers for generating accurate, interpretable, and reliable robot trajectories, aiding general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real success in robotics.

Abstract: Robotic arms require precise, task-aware trajectory planning, yet sequence
models that ignore motion structure often yield invalid or inefficient
executions. We present a Path-based Transformer that encodes robot motion with
a 3-grid (where/what/when) representation and constraint-masked decoding,
enforcing lattice-adjacent moves and workspace bounds while reasoning over task
graphs and action order. Trained on 53,755 trajectories (80% train / 20%
validation), the model aligns closely with ground truth -- 89.44% stepwise
accuracy, 93.32% precision, 89.44% recall, and 90.40% F1 -- with 99.99% of
paths legal by construction. Compiled to motor primitives on an xArm Lite 6
with a depth-camera digital twin, it attains up to 97.5% reach and 92.5% pick
success in controlled tests, and 86.7% end-to-end success across 60
language-specified tasks in cluttered scenes, absorbing slips and occlusions
via local re-grounding without global re-planning. These results show that
path-structured representations enable Transformers to generate accurate,
reliable, and interpretable robot trajectories, bridging graph-based planning
and sequence-based learning and providing a practical foundation for
general-purpose manipulation and sim-to-real transfer.

*Yong Um,Young-Ha Shin,Joon-Ha Kim,Soonpyo Kwon,Hae-Won Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing locomotion that handles uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion, achieving robust performance in both simulation and real hardware tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in quadrupedal wall-climbing locomotion, particularly dealing with uncertainties in magnetic foot adhesion that impact stability.

Method: The method involves using a physics-based adhesion model in simulation and a three-phase curriculum learning approach to stabilize training, adapt to vertical surfaces, and handle adhesion failures.

Result: The proposed policy demonstrates high success rates, strong adhesion retention, and recovery capabilities in simulation under degraded adhesion conditions. It outperforms a baseline model predictive control method and performs successfully on an actual untethered robot.

Conclusion: The study confirms that combining curriculum learning with realistic adhesion modeling creates a robust framework for magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing
locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A
physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is
incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,
and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable
reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait
on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to
vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic
adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a
high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from
detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model
predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller
maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware
experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling
on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and
incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning
with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for
magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.

### [314] [A Contact-Driven Framework for Manipulating in the Blind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20177)
*Muhammad Suhail Saleem,Lai Yuan,Maxim Likhachev*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for robots to operate in visually challenging environments using contact feedback and structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often encounter poorly lit, cluttered, or occluded spaces where vision is insufficient, requiring the use of contact feedback to navigate and manipulate objects reliably.

Method: The framework integrates contact detection, occupancy estimation, and path planning. It uses joint torque sensing, contact particle filter, learned predictors for workspace understanding, and robust path planning to minimize collisions and task inefficiencies.

Result: The framework demonstrated success in reducing task completion time by up to 2x compared to baselines in simulation and real-world tasks involving manipulation in cluttered and occluded environments.

Conclusion: Integrating contact feedback and structural priors allows robots to robustly manipulate and navigate in unseen, cluttered spaces, proving the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Robots often face manipulation tasks in environments where vision is
inadequate due to clutter, occlusions, or poor lighting--for example, reaching
a shutoff valve at the back of a sink cabinet or locating a light switch above
a crowded shelf. In such settings, robots, much like humans, must rely on
contact feedback to distinguish free from occupied space and navigate around
obstacles. Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural
priors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be
exploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We
present a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for
manipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural
priors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework
comprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and
localization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle
filter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module
that uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map
of the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned
predictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact
localization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths
that avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating
feasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world
on a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve
under a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object
from a cluttered shelf. Results show that the framework reliably solves these
tasks, achieving up to a 2x reduction in task completion time compared to
baselines, with ablations confirming the contribution of each module.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study experimentally validates satellite swarm control using a learning-aided magnetic field interaction method for scalable long-term satellite formation maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in maintaining large-scale satellite formations using magnetically actuated swarm control methods, particularly focusing on issues including scalability, nonholonomic constraints, underactuation, and computational cost.

Method: Researchers developed a learning-aided time-integrated current control method to optimize magnetic field interaction among satellites and conducted ground-based experiments using a tailored platform mimicking orbital dynamics.

Result: Critical aspects of the control method were validated, demonstrating enhanced controllability, decentralized current management, and introducing a new model-based power-optimal swarm control framework (NODA-MMH).

Conclusion: The findings confirm the effectiveness of magnetic field-based satellite swarm control, providing a promising avenue for scalable and efficient long-term formation maintenance, complementing prior work in this field.

Abstract: This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation
maintenance problem.

*Mert Bulent Sariyildiz,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Guillaume Bono,Gianluca Monaci,Christian Wolf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Kinaema, a spatially aware robot model that uses latent memory and transformers for navigation and query-based localization, optimizing efficiency without storing observation history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatially aware robots' efficiency by situating themselves relative to previously seen spaces without explicitly storing their observation history.

Method: The model uses a recurrent transformer to update implicit latent memory, allowing for the compression of sensor reading history into a compact representation for navigation and query-based relative localization.

Result: Kinaema maintains a useful scene representation, effectively navigates to pre-observed goals, and demonstrates computational efficiency compared to classical transformers.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves navigation and localization tasks with robust efficiency, offering an alternative to classical transformer designs using latent memory.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

*Ajay Sridhar,Jennifer Pan,Satvik Sharma,Chelsea Finn*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemER, a model incorporating hierarchical policies for robots to utilize memory effectively in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robots lack the memory utilization that humans naturally employ for tasks, leading to inefficiency, especially in long-horizon dependencies.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical framework where a high-level policy selects relevant keyframes from observation histories and generates instructions for a low-level policy. This integrates with existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

Result: MemER shows superior performance compared to previous methods in real-world, long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks, as evidenced by experiments.

Conclusion: MemER effectively enables robots to utilize memory, enhancing their capability for efficient task performance over extended periods.

Abstract: Humans routinely rely on memory to perform tasks, yet most robot policies
lack this capability; our goal is to endow robot policies with the same
ability. Naively conditioning on long observation histories is computationally
expensive and brittle under covariate shift, while indiscriminate subsampling
of history leads to irrelevant or redundant information. We propose a
hierarchical policy framework, where the high-level policy is trained to select
and track previous relevant keyframes from its experience. The high-level
policy uses selected keyframes and the most recent frames when generating text
instructions for a low-level policy to execute. This design is compatible with
existing vision-language-action (VLA) models and enables the system to
efficiently reason over long-horizon dependencies. In our experiments, we
finetune Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and $\pi_{0.5}$ as the high-level and low-level
policies respectively, using demonstrations supplemented with minimal language
annotations. Our approach, MemER, outperforms prior methods on three real-world
long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks that require minutes of memory. Videos

*Zixuan Wu,Hengyuan Zhang,Ting-Hsuan Chen,Yuliang Guo,David Paz,Xinyu Huang,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking system that combines visual foundation models and diffusion-based planning for robust motion planning across various challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous parking approaches face challenges in maintaining robustness under domain shifts like weather and lighting variations.

Method: The paper proposes DDP, a pipeline trained in CARLA simulations, which utilizes visual foundation models and diffusion-based planning, enabling zero-shot performance in adversarial settings.

Result: DDP achieves over 90% parking success rate in all tested out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming existing baselines, with promising sim-to-real transfer demonstrated in a 3D reconstructed parking lot.

Conclusion: The integration of visual models and diffusion-based planning ensures robust, domain-agnostic parking solutions that improve cross-domain performance and exhibit potential for real-world application.

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a decentralized reinforcement learning approach for modular reconfigurable robots, achieving zero-shot generalization for unseen configurations in both simulations and field tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The combinatorial growth of morphologies in modular reconfigurable robots presents a challenge for unified control in task-specific space operations, calling for a scalable and efficient solution.

Method: The authors used a decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) framework where each module independently learns its policies: (1) Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion, and (2) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and manipulation of 7-DoF limbs.

Result: Simulation results showed high accuracy and efficiency: steering achieved a mean error of 3.63°, manipulation reached 84.6% success, and wheels reduced motor torque by 95.4% while maintaining 99.6% success. Field tests validated autonomous locomotion, steering, and reconfiguration alignment on a lunar-analogue setup.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized approach demonstrated seamless adaptability and scalability across various configurations, marking significant advancements for modular robots in space exploration.

Abstract: Modular reconfigurable robots suit task-specific space operations, but the
combinatorial growth of morphologies hinders unified control. We propose a
decentralized reinforcement learning (Dec-RL) scheme where each module learns
its own policy: wheel modules use Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for locomotion and
7-DoF limbs use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for steering and
manipulation, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen configurations. In
simulation, the steering policy achieved a mean absolute error of 3.63{\deg}
between desired and induced angles; the manipulation policy plateaued at 84.6 %
success on a target-offset criterion; and the wheel policy cut average motor
torque by 95.4 % relative to baseline while maintaining 99.6 % success.
Lunar-analogue field tests validated zero-shot integration for autonomous
locomotion, steering, and preliminary alignment for reconfiguration. The system
transitioned smoothly among synchronous, parallel, and sequential modes for
Policy Execution, without idle states or control conflicts, indicating a
scalable, reusable, and robust approach for modular lunar robots.

*Yijiong Lin,Bowen Deng,Chenghua Lu,Max Yang,Efi Psomopoulou,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes NeuralTouch, a multimodal framework combining Neural Descriptor Fields (NDF) and tactile sensing to improve robotic grasping accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance grasping accuracy for robotic manipulation, overcoming limitations of existing methods due to imperfect perception and restricted tactile sensing capabilities.

Method: Introduced NeuralTouch, which integrates NDF for implicit target contact representation with a deep reinforcement learning policy for tactile-driven grasp refinement.

Result: NeuralTouch showed improved grasping accuracy and robustness over baselines in both simulations and real-world tasks like peg-out-in-hole and bottle lid opening.

Conclusion: NeuralTouch is effective in enabling precise, generalizable, and tactile-driven robotic manipulation, paving the way for advancements in contact-rich handling tasks.

Abstract: Grasping accuracy is a critical prerequisite for precise object manipulation,
often requiring careful alignment between the robot hand and object. Neural
Descriptor Fields (NDF) offer a promising vision-based method to generate
grasping poses that generalize across object categories. However, NDF alone can
produce inaccurate poses due to imperfect camera calibration, incomplete point
clouds, and object variability. Meanwhile, tactile sensing enables more precise
contact, but existing approaches typically learn policies limited to simple,
predefined contact geometries. In this work, we introduce NeuralTouch, a
multimodal framework that integrates NDF and tactile sensing to enable
accurate, generalizable grasping through gentle physical interaction. Our
approach leverages NDF to implicitly represent the target contact geometry,
from which a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy is trained to refine the
grasp using tactile feedback. This policy is conditioned on the neural
descriptors and does not require explicit specification of contact types. We
validate NeuralTouch through ablation studies in simulation and zero-shot
transfer to real-world manipulation tasks--such as peg-out-in-hole and bottle
lid opening--without additional fine-tuning. Results show that NeuralTouch
significantly improves grasping accuracy and robustness over baseline methods,
offering a general framework for precise, contact-rich robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PointMapPolicy is a novel approach leveraging fusion of point clouds and RGB data for robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of individual sensing modalities like point clouds (lacking fine-grained details) and RGB images (lacking geometric awareness) in robotic manipulation.

Method: Introduced PointMapPolicy, which conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points, enabling incorporation of computer vision techniques with xLSTM as the backbone to fuse point maps and RGB data.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on various robotic manipulation tasks demonstrated through experiments on RoboCasa and CALVIN benchmarks, and validated on real robots.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances multi-modal perception and achieves significant improvements in robotic manipulation tasks by combining the strengths of point clouds and RGB data.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation systems benefit from complementary sensing modalities,
where each provides unique environmental information. Point clouds capture
detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context.
Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially
for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders
their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel
approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points
without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape
and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between
reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the
use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM
as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for
enhanced multi-modal perception. Through extensive experiments on the RoboCasa
and CALVIN benchmarks and real robot evaluations, we demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse manipulation tasks.

Method: A mixed reality-based system (MR-UBi) was developed which overlays reaction torque data using bilateral control in a MR headset. Sixteen participants tested its effectiveness against traditional bilateral control.

Result: MR-UBi significantly enhanced torque control accuracy and reduced errors in force application. It also showed higher usability and lowered cognitive workload in subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: MR-UBi provides more stable, accurate, and user-friendly underwater robot arm teleoperation, validating the integration of visual and haptic feedback as effective.

Abstract: We present a mixed reality-based underwater robot arm teleoperation system
with a reaction torque indicator via bilateral control (MR-UBi). The reaction
torque indicator (RTI) overlays a color and length-coded torque bar in the
MR-HMD, enabling seamless integration of visual and haptic feedback during

compared MR-UBi against a bilateral-control baseline. MR-UBi significantly
improved grasping-torque control accuracy, increasing the time within the
optimal torque range and reducing both low and high grasping torque range
during lift and pick-and-place tasks with objects of different stiffness.
Subjective evaluations further showed higher usability (SUS) and lower workload

*Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller,Ronald Naderer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for robot trajectory planning using B-splines to ensure smooth movement, considering processing paths and velocity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to efficiently plan a trajectory when it is more practical to move the part instead of the tool center point (TCP), allowing for ease in processing paths.

Method: The method involves using B-splines for representing robot paths, ensuring continuous and smooth trajectories while accounting for prescribed orientations and velocity constraints.

Result: The approach was validated successfully on an industrial robot, demonstrating smooth movement for an arbitrarily defined part.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical and effective solution for trajectory planning in situations where moving the part is advantageous over moving the tool.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for planning a trajectory in workspace
coordinates using a spatially fixed tool center point (TCP), while taking into
account the processing path on a part. This approach is beneficial if it is
easier to move the part rather than moving the tool. Whether a mathematical
description that defines the shape to be processed or single points from a
design program are used, the robot path is finally represented using B-splines.
The use of splines enables the path to be continuous with a desired degree,
which finally leads to a smooth robot trajectory. While calculating the robot
trajectory through prescribed orientation, additionally a given velocity at the
TCP has to be considered. The procedure was validated on a real system using an
industrial robot moving an arbitrary defined part.

TL;DR: This paper presents an adaptive cooperative localization approach utilizing factor-graph formulation to fuse asynchronous multi-robot sensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global Navigation Satellite System-denied environments require accurate localization. Carrying many sensors on a single robot increases power and weight, while distributing them across multiple robots introduces challenges in data fusion.

Method: The paper introduces a factor-graph-based approach to fuse Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), and inter-robot detections across heterogeneous robots. Novel interpolation-based factors and weighting techniques are used to manage unsynchronized and degraded sensor data.

Result: Real-world evaluations involving heterogeneous teams of UGVs and UAVs show improved localization accuracy despite sensor degradation.

Conclusion: Distributing and adaptively fusing multi-modal sensor data among robots using this method notably enhances localization accuracy in challenging environments.

Abstract: Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.

*Victor Vantilborgh,Hrishikesh Sathyanarayan,Guillaume Crevecoeur,Ian Abraham,Tom Lefebvre*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods to optimize robot manipulation tasks with unknown dynamics by embedding parameter adaptation into control strategies, demonstrated on pick-and-place tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation tasks often face challenges with payload uncertainty requiring active exploration and continuous online adaptation for precise control.

Method: The problem is structured using a simplified dual control approach, embedding adaptation in feedback policies. Two trajectory generation methods are introduced: one minimizes expected costs under uncertainty, and the other reduces sensitivity of information loss impacting performance.

Result: The proposed approaches validate faster, more accurate task execution, improved system identification, stable and efficient control applied to pick-and-place tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating trajectory design with adaptive control enhances robotic manipulation performance under dynamic uncertainties.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates energy optimization for parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) performing repetitive tasks using series elastic actuators (SEA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing energy consumption in long-running pick-and-place tasks using PKM is crucial for efficiency and sustainability.

Method: The study formulates an energy-minimizing optimal control problem by developing a dynamic model for SEA-driven PKM and optimizing operating trajectories and actuator stiffnesses.

Result: Experiments on robot applications show that optimizing SEA stiffness and trajectories effectively reduces energy consumption.

Conclusion: The proposed method is a valid approach for reducing energy consumption in PKM performing pick-and-place tasks, specifically by utilizing oscillating properties of actuator springs.

Abstract: A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
results confirm the validity of this approach.

Motivation: To address the challenge of the simulation-reality gap, which obstructs effective transition of robot systems from simulation to real-world applications.

Method: The paper conducts a comprehensive survey of the sim-to-real transfer landscape, analyzing causes, solutions, and evaluation methods for overcoming the reality gap.

Result: While promising progress has been achieved using techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer, and sim-real co-training, challenges in closing the reality gap remain.

Conclusion: A deeper understanding of the root causes of the reality gap is required to further overcome barriers in robotics. The survey contributes by synthesizing existing methods and pointing out open issues.

Abstract: Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for time-optimal path following that avoids singularities by maximizing path speed instead of minimizing travel time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational difficulty in time-optimal path following due to singularities at zero path speed.

Method: Introduce a method focused on maximizing path speed along a given path while ensuring smooth and computationally efficient trajectory planning.

Result: The reformulated method leads to a numerically efficient and linear optimization approach for the problem.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively generates smooth and efficient trajectories, overcoming singularity challenges.

Abstract: In this paper the computational challenges of time-optimal path following are
addressed. The standard approach is to minimize the travel time, which
inevitably leads to singularities at zero path speed, when reformulating the
optimization problem in terms of a path parameter. Thus, smooth trajectory
generation while maintaining a low computational effort is quite challenging,
since the singularities have to be taken into account. To this end, a different
approach is presented in this paper. This approach is based on maximizing the
path speed along a prescribed path. Furthermore, the approach is capable of
planning smooth trajectories numerically efficient. Moreover, the discrete
reformulation of the underlying problem is linear in optimization variables.

TL;DR: The paper introduces RubbleSim, an open-source simulator designed for exploring void spaces in structural collapses, offering photorealistic, configurable, and physics-based simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited accessible data on void space structures from structural collapse incidents due to legal and proprietary restrictions, hindering research and advancements.

Method: RubbleSim was developed in Unity with multi-OS support, incorporating physics-based techniques to generate stochastic rubble piles for simulating void spaces, informed by visits to real training rubble sites.

Result: The simulation demonstrated the degradation of perception performance in challenging void space environments using a structure-from-motion algorithm.

Conclusion: RubbleSim facilitates research by providing an open-access tool for simulating structural collapse environments, bridging a critical gap in the field. Source code and binaries are publicly available for utilization.

Abstract: Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are

TL;DR: C-Nav is a framework for continual object navigation that integrates a dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism and an adaptive sampling strategy to optimize performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of enabling embodied agents to navigate dynamically and adapt to new object categories in open-world environments without forgetting previously learned information.

Method: C-Nav combines a dual-path anti-forgetting mechanism (feature distillation and feature replay) and an adaptive sampling strategy, which ensures consistent representation and policy, while reducing memory redundancy.

Result: C-Nav outperforms existing methods on continual object navigation tasks, achieving better performance and lower memory requirements compared to baselines, even those retaining full trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed C-Nav framework successfully addresses continual object navigation challenges, offering enhanced performance and memory efficiency. The methods are effective for real-world, evolving environments.

Abstract: Embodied agents are expected to perform object navigation in dynamic,
open-world environments. However, existing approaches typically rely on static
trajectories and a fixed set of object categories during training, overlooking
the real-world requirement for continual adaptation to evolving scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we introduce the continual object navigation
benchmark, which requires agents to acquire navigation skills for new object
categories while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of previously learned
knowledge. To tackle this challenge, we propose C-Nav, a continual visual
navigation framework that integrates two key innovations: (1) A dual-path
anti-forgetting mechanism, which comprises feature distillation that aligns
multi-modal inputs into a consistent representation space to ensure
representation consistency, and feature replay that retains temporal features
within the action decoder to ensure policy consistency. (2) An adaptive
sampling strategy that selects diverse and informative experiences, thereby
reducing redundancy and minimizing memory overhead. Extensive experiments
across multiple model architectures demonstrate that C-Nav consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance even compared
to baselines with full trajectory retention, while significantly lowering
memory requirements. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a reinforcement learning framework that enables quadrupeds to adapt their gaits in real-time for energy efficiency and task appropriateness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of model-free RL such as single-gait convergence and the lack of adaptability in traditional MPC for quadruped locomotion.

Method: Combine Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) with Dreamer module to optimize actions and gait variables in real-time, incorporating a learned reward function for efficient and stable locomotion.

Result: Evaluation in simulation demonstrated up to 36.48% reduction in energy consumption with accurate velocity tracking and adaptive gaits.

Conclusion: This approach achieves real-time gait adaptability and optimal performance, improving energy efficiency while ensuring stability and smooth transitions in quadruped locomotion.

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled adaptable and agile
quadruped locomotion; however, policies often converge to a single gait,
leading to suboptimal performance. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control
(MPC) has been extensively used to obtain task-specific optimal policies but
lacks the ability to adapt to varying environments. To address these
limitations, we propose an optimization framework for real-time gait adaptation
in a continuous gait space, combining the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
algorithm with a Dreamer module to produce adaptive and optimal policies for
quadruped locomotion. At each time step, MPPI jointly optimizes the actions and
gait variables using a learned Dreamer reward that promotes velocity tracking,
energy efficiency, stability, and smooth transitions, while penalizing abrupt
gait changes. A learned value function is incorporated as terminal reward,
extending the formulation to an infinite-horizon planner. We evaluate our
framework in simulation on the Unitree Go1, demonstrating an average reduction
of up to 36.48\% in energy consumption across varying target speeds, while
maintaining accurate tracking and adaptive, task-appropriate gaits.

TL;DR: FieldGen is introduced as a framework for scalable and high-quality real-world data collection for robotic manipulation, improving diversity, precision, and reducing human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for collecting data for robotic manipulation face challenges in balancing scalability, diversity, and quality.

Method: FieldGen decomposes manipulation into pre-manipulation and fine manipulation phases. Using human demonstrations, the framework employs an attraction field to generate diverse trajectories leading to successful manipulation configurations.

Result: FieldGen-trained policies achieved higher success rates and stability compared to traditional teleoperation methods, with significantly less human effort.

Conclusion: FieldGen shows promise in advancing large-scale real-world robotic manipulation by combining scalability and precision, and enhancing policy learning with reward annotations.

Abstract: Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic
manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance
scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided
data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality
real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory

*Guangqi Jiang,Haoran Chang,Ri-Zhao Qiu,Yutong Liang,Mazeyu Ji,Jiyue Zhu,Zhao Dong,Xueyan Zou,Xiaolong Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GSWorld introduces a photo-realistic robotic manipulation simulator using 3D Gaussian Splatting combined with physics engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic manipulation policy development using realistic simulation environments without relying on real robots.

Method: GSWorld employs a new format called GSDF (Gaussian Scene Description File) integrating Gaussian-on-Mesh representation, robot URDFs, and physics engines for creating diverse, photo-realistic manipulation scenarios.

Result: The framework enables applications like zero-shot sim2real policy learning, automated data collection, benchmarking, simulation-driven teleoperation, and visual reinforcement learning without the need for real robots.

Conclusion: GSWorld provides a robust platform for advancing sim2real research and deploying policies with high reproducibility and photo-realism, fostering innovation in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual
reinforcement learning. Website: https://3dgsworld.github.io/.

*Mateo Guaman Castro,Sidharth Rajagopal,Daniel Gorbatov,Matt Schmittle,Rohan Baijal,Octi Zhang,Rosario Scalise,Sidharth Talia,Emma Romig,Celso de Melo,Byron Boots,Abhishek Gupta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAMOS, a hierarchical system that optimizes robotic navigation across distinct robot embodiments by separating semantic planning and physical constraints using affordance models. VAMOS achieves higher success rates compared to state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robot navigation systems that generalize across diverse environments and adapt to the unique physical constraints and capabilities of varying robot embodiments.

Method: The approach involves a hierarchical decoupling of semantic planning and embodiment grounding. A high-level generalist planner operates with open-world data, while a low-level specialist affordance model evaluates physical constraints in simulation. These subsystems use a designed interface that re-ranks proposed paths in image space.

Result: VAMOS outperforms state-of-the-art models in both indoor and outdoor navigation tasks, achieving 3X higher success rates by eliminating physically infeasible plans. It supports cross-embodiment navigation for various robot types and is adjustable via natural language inputs.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design of VAMOS allows for efficient and adaptable navigation across different robot embodiments, improving reliability and enabling generalized applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:

### [335] [E-Test: E'er-Improving Test Suites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19860)
*Ketai Qiu,Luca Di Grazia,Leonardo Mariani,Mauro Pezzè*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: E-Test is an automated tool leveraging large language models to enhance test suite coverage by identifying not-yet-tested scenarios from production data and generating corresponding test cases, significantly outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing software is labor-intensive and finding scenarios outside a current test suite for large systems is challenging. There is a need to improve test suites to enhance reliability and reduce manual effort.

Method: E-Test uses Large Language Models to detect under-tested execution scenarios from large production datasets and generates additional test cases to fill gaps in the test suite.

Result: E-Test outperformed state-of-the-art approaches (F1-scores: 0.34 for regression testing/field testing approaches and 0.39 for vanilla LLMs) with an F1-score of 0.55 in identifying untested execution scenarios.

Conclusion: E-Test enhances test suites significantly, reducing manual effort while improving coverage for scenarios encountered in production testing, showcasing its potential in advancing software reliability.

Abstract: Test suites are inherently imperfect, and testers can always enrich a suite
with new test cases that improve its quality and, consequently, the reliability
of the target software system. However, finding test cases that explore
execution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely
challenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites
over extended periods.
  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between
the execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced
after testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore
execution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions
that have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those
monitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases
that enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to
pinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and
augments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.
  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred
open-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates
that E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better
than state-of-the-art approaches. While existing regression testing and field
testing approaches for this task achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.34, and
vanilla LLMs achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.39, E-Test reaches 0.55. These
results highlight the impact of E-Test in enhancing test suites by effectively
targeting not-yet-tested execution scenarios and reducing manual effort
required for maintaining test suites.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spreadsheet Operations Documentation (SOD) as an AI task for generating explanations from spreadsheet operations and evaluates five LLMs on this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheet operations in business and finance lack systematic documentation methods, limiting automation, collaboration, and institutional knowledge transfer.

Method: It presents a benchmark dataset of 111 spreadsheet manipulation code snippets paired with natural language summaries and evaluates five LLMs using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR metrics.

Result: Findings indicate LLMs are capable of accurate spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a viable step toward improving reproducibility, maintainability, and collaboration.

Conclusion: SOD enhances collaborative workflows and operational documentation in spreadsheets, though challenges remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces KGACG, a framework leveraging agent collaboration to improve automated code generation for complex application-level software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in generating well-structured and maintainable large-scale application-level software code.

Method: The KGACG framework employs a closed-loop collaboration among three agents - Code Organization & Planning Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), supported by feedback mechanisms.

Result: A Java Tank Battle game case study demonstrates the collaborative process and challenges faced in implementing the KGACG framework.

Conclusion: KGACG aims to automate and enhance the development of application-level software through structured agent collaboration and feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Automated code generation driven by Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) has
enhanced development efficiency, yet generating complex application-level
software code remains challenging. Multi-agent frameworks show potential, but
existing methods perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software
code generation, failing to ensure reasonable orga- nizational structures of
project code and making it difficult to maintain the code generation process.
To address this, this paper envisions a Knowledge-Guided Application-Level Code
Generation framework named KGACG, which aims to trans- form software
requirements specification and architectural design document into executable
code through a collaborative closed- loop of the Code Organization & Planning
Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), combined with a
feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the collaborative process of the agents in
KGACG in a Java Tank Battle game case study while facing challenges. KGACG is
dedicated to advancing the automation of application-level software
development.

*Atharv Sonwane,Isadora White,Hyunji Lee,Matheus Pereira,Lucas Caccia,Minseon Kim,Zhengyan Shi,Chinmay Singh,Alessandro Sordoni,Marc-Alexandre Côté,Xingdi Yuan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to generate synthetic bugs for better training of language model-based software engineering (SWE) agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create high-quality training data for SWE agents by generating difficult and diverse bugs that realistically reflect human development patterns.

Method: The method involves tasking SWE agents to implement new features in the codebase, unintentionally causing test-breaking bugs, avoiding unrealistic artificial bug generation techniques.

Result: The generated bugs improve supervised fine-tuning efficiency, outperforming existing bug datasets by 2% with half the training data, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in SWE-bench Verified with FrogBoss (32B parameter model) and FrogMini (14B parameter model).

Conclusion: Synthetic bugs generated through realistic methods can enhance the training of SWE agents, improving their performance significantly while reducing required training data.

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over
three seeds.

*Konstantinos Kitsios,Marcel Böhme,Alberto Bacchelli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that determines effective mutator sequences based on learned probabilities to improve test input generation and identifies issues missed by existing fuzzers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether the order of applying mutators in greybox fuzzers influences their effectiveness in terms of code coverage and bug detection.

Method: A linear model analyzes the impact of mutator pair sequences on fuzzing effectiveness. MuoFuzz is introduced to learn conditional probabilities for selecting mutator sequences.

Result: MuoFuzz demonstrates higher code coverage and bug discovery compared to AFL++ and MOPT, uncovering bugs other tools missed.

Conclusion: Choosing promising mutator sequences significantly enhances fuzzing efficiency, with MuoFuzz outperforming existing solutions in experimental benchmarks.

Abstract: A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new
test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or
deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all
coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the
order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the
effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to
a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and
indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more
efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher
likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the
most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability
that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously
selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random
walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to
AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the
selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the
FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code
coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and
MOPT.

*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces FAIGMOE, a framework for adopting Generative AI (GenAI) in midsize and enterprise organizations, addressing challenges like resource constraints and organizational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of specific frameworks for adopting and integrating GenAI in midsize organizations and enterprises, considering their unique challenges.

Method: FAIGMOE synthesizes technology adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion concepts into four phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and Operationalization and Optimization.

Result: FAIGMOE offers scalable, actionable guidance tailored to organizational scale and complexity for adopting GenAI, including unique considerations like prompt engineering and hallucination management.

Conclusion: FAIGMOE fills a critical gap in existing adoption literature, providing a first-of-its-kind comprehensive framework for GenAI implementation, yet requires future empirical validation.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents transformative
opportunities for organizations, yet both midsize organizations and larger
enterprises face distinctive adoption challenges. Midsize organizations
encounter resource constraints and limited AI expertise, while enterprises
struggle with organizational complexity and coordination challenges. Existing
technology adoption frameworks, including TAM (Technology Acceptance Model),
TOE (Technology Organization Environment), and DOI (Diffusion of Innovations)
theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these
diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper
introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI
in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing
the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology
adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion
perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning
and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and
Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on
readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical
architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and
complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including
prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that
distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective
contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework
explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise
organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment
instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through
future research.

### [341] [The Cost of Downgrading Build Systems: A Case Study of Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20041)
*Gareema Ranjan,Mahmoud Alfadel,Gengyi Sun,Shane McIntosh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the implications of downgrading from an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to language-specific tools like Go Build, using Kubernetes and other projects as case studies. Findings include trade-offs in performance, memory usage, and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers frequently use build systems, and their performance significantly affects productivity. Previous studies lack exploration of the implications of downgrading build tools, which this paper investigates.

Method: The authors conduct a case study of Kubernetes and compare the performance (build time, memory, and CPU usage) of Bazel and Go Build during a downgrade. They also replicate the study on four other projects to generalize findings.

Result: Bazel builds outperform Go Build in terms of speed but have higher memory and CPU usage. Downgrading to Go Build increased CI resource costs for Kubernetes and incurred similar performance costs in other studied projects.

Conclusion: While artifact-based build tools like Bazel enhance performance, they have downsides such as higher memory and resource use. Maintaining these tools may be challenging, but abandoning them can be costly for large projects.

Abstract: Since developers invoke the build system frequently, its performance can
impact productivity. Modern artifact-based build tools accelerate builds, yet
prior work shows that teams may abandon them for alternatives that are easier
to maintain. While prior work shows why downgrades are performed, the
implications of downgrades remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
describe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from
an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go
Build). We reproduce and analyze the full and incremental builds of change sets
during the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are
faster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose
a larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel
builds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for
full builds and above one for incremental builds. We estimate that downgrading
from Bazel can increase CI resource costs by up to 76 explore whether our
observations generalize by replicating our Kubernetes study on four other
projects that also downgraded from Bazel to older build tools. We observe that
while build time penalties decrease, Bazel consistently consumes more memory.
We conclude that abandoning artifact-based build tools, despite perceived
maintainability benefits, tends to incur considerable performance costs for
large projects. Our observations may help stakeholders to balance trade-offs in
build tool adoption

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores a model-driven re-engineering process for migrating legacy RAD platform applications (Oracle Forms and PL/SQL code) to Java using model transformations and validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many enterprises seek to migrate outdated RAD application systems to modern technologies (e.g., from Oracle Forms/PLSQL to Java) to keep up with evolving software standards.

Method: The research adopts a model-driven re-engineering process using Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel (KDM) and integrates TDD-like methods with incremental model transformations and validations for code generation.

Result: The authors developed a migration tool enabling the conversion of monolithic PL/SQL code on triggers and program units into modular Java code split into tiers. This solution followed thorough implementation and validation processes.

Conclusion: The proposed model-driven approach effectively modernizes legacy RAD applications, ensuring the quality of generated code and providing a structured software process that can be adapted for similar migrations.

Abstract: Model-driven software engineering (MDE) techniques are not only useful in
forward engineering scenarios, but can also be successfully applied to evolve
existing systems. RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the
nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a
large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications,
such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software
company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms
triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers.
  Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to
develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy
code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In
this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven
re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally
develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated
code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are
explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the
application of MDE.

*Zhenning Yang,Hui Guan,Victor Nicolet,Brandon Paulsen,Joey Dodds,Daniel Kroening,Ang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NSync, a system enhancing Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) by reconciling external changes through cloud API analysis, addressing infrastructure drift and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue where IaC frameworks lose visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift and complications in managing cloud resources.

Method: NSync detects changes via cloud API traces, infers intents using LLMs, updates IaC configurations through specialized tools, and improves through self-evolving knowledge from previous reconciliations.

Result: Experiments on five real-world Terraform projects and 372 scenarios showed NSync improved accuracy from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3 and token efficiency by 1.47x compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: NSync improves IaC reconciliation by automatically integrating external changes, enhancing cloud infrastructure management reliability and efficiency.

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally,
cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of
choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have
quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the
infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of
automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,
or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment
with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,
or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure
drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may
undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates
out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that
infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the
lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API
traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update
the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic
architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API
sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and
continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past
reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting
realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation
performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372
drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of
accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$
improvement).

TL;DR: Classport enables runtime introspection of dependencies in Java by embedding dependency data into class files.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Java lacks the capability for runtime introspection of dependencies, which is essential for Software Supply Chain security.

Method: The authors propose Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java class files to enable runtime retrieval of dependency data.

Result: Classport was evaluated on six real-world projects and proved effective in identifying dependencies during runtime.

Conclusion: Classport provides a viable solution for runtime dependency introspection in Java, paving the way for enhanced runtime integrity checks.

Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which
dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for
Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this
problem with Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java
class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We
evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in
identifying dependencies at runtime. Runtime dependency introspection with
Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a secure distributed co-simulation approach using UniFMU to improve IP protection and cybersecurity during model sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of guidelines for protecting Intellectual Property (IP) and mitigating hacking risks in distributed co-simulation.

Method: Developing a distributed co-simulation approach leveraging UniFMU with cybersecurity enhancements and ensuring secure client-initiated connections on trusted platforms.

Result: The proposed approach was tested in two co-simulation demos across four network settings and demonstrated improved IP protection and cybersecurity.

Conclusion: The study highlights the functionality and trade-offs between IP protection and performance efficiency in distributed co-simulation systems with enhanced security measures.

Abstract: Distributed co-simulation plays a key role in enabling collaborative modeling
and simulation by different stakeholders while protecting their Intellectual
Property (IP). Although IP protection is provided implicitly by co-simulation,
there is no consensus in the guidelines to conduct distributed co-simulation of
continuous-time or hybrid systems with no exposure to potential hacking
attacks. We propose an approach for distributed co-simulation on top of UniFMU
with enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection mechanisms, ensuring that the
connection is initiated by the client and the models and binaries live on
trusted platforms. We showcase the functionality of this approach using two
co-simulation demos in four different network settings and analyze the
trade-off between IP-protected distribution and performance efficiency in these
settings.

TL;DR: This study investigates factors that enable or hinder the adoption of deductive verification by analyzing insights from interviews with industry and academic practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite its proven usefulness in specific projects, deductive verification has not gained mainstream adoption. This paper aims to identify the obstacles and enablers for broader use.

Method: The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners from industry and academia and applied thematic analysis to the collected data.

Result: The study highlights known challenges like the high expertise required but also identifies underexplored issues such as proof maintenance, limited automation control, and usability concerns.

Conclusion: The findings provide specific recommendations for improving the usability, automation, and integration of deductive verification tools, thereby enabling better adoption in practice.

Abstract: Deductive verification is an effective method to ensure that a given system
exposes the intended behavior. In spite of its proven usefulness and
feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a
mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study
investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive
verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from
both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data
employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar

### [348] [Large Language Models for Fault Localization: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20521)
*YingJian Xiao,RongQun Hu,WeiWei Gong,HongWei Li,AnQuan Jie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper studies large language models (LLMs) in fault localization tasks, evaluating their performance, prompting strategies, and constraints. It highlights the role of bug report context and factors influencing reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate LLMs' performance in fault localization of code, an area with limited evaluations despite their proven capabilities in automated program repair.

Method: The study tested both open-source and closed-source LLMs using datasets like HumanEval-Java and Defects4J. Different prompting strategies, such as standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning, were analyzed across metrics like accuracy, efficiency, and cost.

Result: Findings indicate that including bug report context significantly improves fault localization. Few-shot examples added value but with diminishing returns, and chain-of-reasoning proved effective only when the model already possessed strong reasoning skills.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate promising fault localization capabilities, and performance is heavily influenced by prompting techniques and model characteristics. This provides insights into enhancing fault localization effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the
effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of
upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently
lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the
statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative
open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source
models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization
capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study
investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard
prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with
a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost
dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context
significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for
improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while
chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks,
but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and
strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.

### [349] [A Soundness and Precision Benchmark for Java Debloating Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20679)
*Jonas Klauke,Tom Ohlmer,Stefan Schott,Serena Elisa Ponta,Wolfram Fischer,Eric Bodden*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the prevalence of unnecessary dependencies in software projects and introduces a micro-benchmark tool, Deblometer, for evaluating debloating tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve debloating tools that remove unnecessary code and dependencies while maintaining software correctness.

Method: The authors designed Deblometer, a benchmark with 59 test cases including ground truth data on necessary and bloated constructs. They assessed the soundness and precision of three Java debloating tools (Deptrim, JShrink, ProGuard).

Result: All evaluated tools showed unsoundness, especially in dynamic class loading. Deptrim retained more bloated constructs, ProGuard removed necessary ones, and JShrink had significant issues with annotations.

Conclusion: Current debloating tools face challenges in balancing removal of unused constructs with maintaining functionality, necessitating advancements for reliable software debloating.

Abstract: Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as
dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36
dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of
dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies
are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain
unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development
of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs
while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by
preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off,
we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed
to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each
test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and
bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness
and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating
tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools
remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or
execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces
unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains
more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs.
JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for
annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness
issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and
reliable debloated software.

### [350] [Exploring Large Language Models for Access Control Policy Synthesis and Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20692)
*Adarsh Vatsa,Bethel Hall,William Eiers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for synthesizing and analyzing cloud access control policies. Although LLMs show high success in generating and summarizing policies, challenges exist, particularly with policy permissiveness. Combining LLMs with symbolic approaches demonstrates better potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Access control policies for cloud computing are manually written, error-prone, and challenging to analyze due to their complexity. Given the success of LLMs in tasks like code synthesis and summarization, the study explores whether they can enhance policy generation or aid in their understanding.

Method: The study evaluates the performance of various LLMs in generating syntactically correct access control policies and introduces a novel semantic-based request summarization approach using LLMs to analyze such policies.

Result: Findings reveal that reasoning LLMs can generate policies matching specifications 93.7% of the time, while non-reasoning LLMs achieve 45.8%. Furthermore, the semantic-based summarization approach successfully aids in understanding the policies.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit potential in the domain of access control policy synthesis and analysis. Despite challenges in automated generation, combining LLMs with symbolic methodologies enhances policy analysis and understanding, paving the way for better tools in cloud security systems.

Abstract: Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted
on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to
write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to
private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to
their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often
implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to
precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated
code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be
used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in
understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of
LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we
first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding
that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,
they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given
specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time
for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze
policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach
which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests
allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles
in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results
when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.

*Aueaphum Aueawattthanaphisut,Thanyanee Srichaisak,Arissa Ieochai*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Developed a wearable assistance prototype for upper-limb function using sensor fusion and AI. Evaluated with healthy participants showing improved movement and reduced tremors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide better sensor-integrated assistance for upper-limb dysfunction through a wearable prototype for activities of daily living (ADL) tasks.

Method: Prototype integrates sEMG, IMU, flex/force sensors, processed signals for features, micro AI models, and control-barrier-function safety commands tested on 12 healthy volunteers in ADL tasks.

Result: Pilot evaluation showed decreased tremor, increased range of motion, enhanced repetitions, improved EMG slope, and high system efficiency without adverse events.

Conclusion: Technical feasibility demonstrated for an effective assistive wearable system for upper-limb functionality with plans for formal patient studies.

Abstract: A sensor-fused wearable assistance prototype for upper-limb function (triceps
brachii and extensor pollicis brevis) is presented. The device integrates
surface electromyography (sEMG), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and
flex/force sensors on an M5StickC plus an ESP32-S3 compute hub. Signals are
band-pass and notch filtered; features (RMS, MAV, zero-crossings, and 4-12 Hz
tremor-band power) are computed in 250 ms windows and fed to an INT8 TensorFlow
Lite Micro model. Control commands are bounded by a control-barrier-function
safety envelope and delivered within game-based tasks with lightweight
personalization. In a pilot technical feasibility evaluation with healthy
volunteers (n = 12) performing three ADL-oriented tasks, tremor prominence
decreased (Delta TI = -0.092, 95% CI [-0.102, -0.079]), range of motion
increased (+12.65%, 95% CI [+8.43, +13.89]), repetitions rose (+2.99 min^-1,
95% CI [+2.61, +3.35]), and the EMG median-frequency slope became less negative
(Delta = +0.100 Hz/min, 95% CI [+0.083, +0.127]). The sensing-to-assist loop
ran at 100 Hz with 8.7 ms median on-device latency, 100% session completion,
and 0 device-related adverse events. These results demonstrate technical
feasibility of embedded, sensor-fused assistance for upper-limb function;
formal patient studies under IRB oversight are planned.

### [352] [Enhanced Cyclic Coordinate Descent Methods for Elastic Net Penalized Linear Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19999)
*Yixiao Wang,Zishan Shao,Ting Jiang,Aditya Devarakonda*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Enhanced Cyclic Coordinate Descent (ECCD), a faster and efficient method for solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints, achieving a 3× average performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art methods for solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints are computationally expensive and exhibit certain limitations like convergence delays and numerical instability.

Method: The ECCD method redesigns cyclic coordinate descent by using a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to avoid nonlinear gradient computations, unrolling vector recurrences via a tunable parameter, enabling efficient batched computations.

Result: The proposed ECCD method demonstrates a 3× average performance improvement on benchmark datasets when compared to existing solvers. It avoids convergence delays and numerical instability issues found in block coordinate descent.

Conclusion: ECCD offers a computationally efficient approach to solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints. This method is empirically faster, robust, and overcomes existing limitations, with implementation available for public use.

Abstract: We present a novel enhanced cyclic coordinate descent (ECCD) framework for
solving generalized linear models with elastic net constraints that reduces
training time in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. We redesign
the CD method by performing a Taylor expansion around the current iterate to
avoid nonlinear operations arising in the gradient computation. By introducing
this approximation, we are able to unroll the vector recurrences occurring in
the CD method and reformulate the resulting computations into more efficient
batched computations. We show empirically that the recurrence can be unrolled
by a tunable integer parameter, $s$, such that $s > 1$ yields performance
improvements without affecting convergence, whereas $s = 1$ yields the original
CD method. A key advantage of ECCD is that it avoids the convergence delay and
numerical instability exhibited by block coordinate descent. Finally, we
implement our proposed method in C++ using Eigen to accelerate linear algebra
computations. Comparison of our method against existing state-of-the-art
solvers shows consistent performance improvements of $3\times$ in average for
regularization path variant on diverse benchmark datasets. Our implementation
is available at https://github.com/Yixiao-Wang-Stats/ECCD.

*Somayajulu L. N. Dhulipala,Deep Ray,Nicholas Forman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper evaluates compositional diffusion models for simulating coupled PDE systems, showcasing their potential for long-horizon modeling with decoupled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating coupled PDE systems is highly computationally expensive and requires large amounts of coupled data, prompting the need for efficient modeling strategies.

Method: The paper explores diffusion models trained on decoupled PDE data, proposes a symmetric compositional scheme based on the Euler method, and tests v-parameterization strategies against a baseline model and a Fourier Neural Operator.

Result: Compositional diffusion models effectively recover coupled trajectories with low error from decoupled training data. v-parameterization improves accuracy and demonstrates feasibility while the Fourier Neural Operator performs better using coupled data.

Conclusion: Compositional diffusion modeling is a promising and efficient approach for long-horizon modeling of coupled PDE systems with a focus on decoupled data training.

Abstract: Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior
efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled)
data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study
compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on
the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the
coupled field. Specifically, we investigate whether the compositional strategy
can be feasible under long time horizons involving a large number of time
steps. In addition, we compare a baseline diffusion model with that trained
using the v-parameterization strategy. We also introduce a symmetric
compositional scheme for the coupled fields based on the Euler scheme. We
evaluate on Reaction-Diffusion and modified Burgers with longer time grids, and
benchmark against a Fourier Neural Operator trained on coupled data. Despite
seeing only decoupled training data, the compositional diffusion models recover
coupled trajectories with low error. v-parameterization can improve accuracy
over a baseline diffusion model, while the neural operator surrogate remains
strongest given that it is trained on the coupled data. These results show that
compositional diffusion is a viable strategy towards efficient, long-horizon
modeling of coupled PDEs.

*Wei Cao,Shanshan Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAERNN, an Expectile Regression Neural Network to handle censored data effectively with flexibility and strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ERNNs focus on fully observed data, neglecting scenarios with censored observations which are common in many real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose DAERNN, a data augmentation-based ERNN algorithm that is fully data-driven and adaptable to different censoring mechanisms.

Result: DAERNN demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods for censored ERNNs and achieves results similar to models using fully observed data.

Conclusion: DAERNN combines minimal assumptions, flexibility, and effectiveness in various censoring scenarios, making it a practical choice for analyzing censored data.

Abstract: Expectile regression neural networks (ERNNs) are powerful tools for capturing
heterogeneity and complex nonlinear structures in data. However, most existing
research has primarily focused on fully observed data, with limited attention
paid to scenarios involving censored observations. In this paper, we propose a
data augmentation based ERNNs algorithm, termed DAERNN, for modeling
heterogeneous censored data. The proposed DAERNN is fully data driven, requires
minimal assumptions, and offers substantial flexibility. Simulation studies and
real data applications demonstrate that DAERNN outperforms existing censored
ERNNs methods and achieves predictive performance comparable to models trained
on fully observed data. Moreover, the algorithm provides a unified framework
for handling various censoring mechanisms without requiring explicit parametric
model specification, thereby enhancing its applicability to practical censored
data analysis.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to assess statistical significance of influential data subsets impacting model outcomes with applications across disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying influential data subsets and determining whether their impact is due to genuine problems or natural sampling variation.

Method: Developing a theoretical framework, characterizing extreme value distributions, and enabling hypothesis testing for excessive influence.

Result: Rigorous hypothesis tests replace ad-hoc methods for assessing data influence, with demonstrations in economics, biology, and machine learning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a statistically robust tool to address disproportionate data influence, improving reliability of model findings across fields.

Abstract: Small subsets of data with disproportionate influence on model outcomes can
have dramatic impacts on conclusions, with a few data points sometimes
overturning key findings. While recent work has developed methods to identify
these \emph{most influential sets}, no formal theory exists to determine when
their influence reflects genuine problems rather than natural sampling
variation. We address this gap by developing a principled framework for
assessing the statistical significance of most influential sets. Our
theoretical results characterize the extreme value distributions of maximal
influence and enable rigorous hypothesis tests for excessive influence,
replacing current ad-hoc sensitivity checks. We demonstrate the practical value
of our approach through applications across economics, biology, and machine
learning benchmarks.

*Federico Lozano-Cuadra,Beatriz Soret,Marc Sanchez Net,Abhishek Cauligi,Federico Rossi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a decentralized routing framework for multi-robot exploration under Lunar Delay-Tolerant Network constraints, using a POMDP formulation and GAT-MARL policy for decentralized execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to address routing challenges for autonomous lunar rovers that need to relay data under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility patterns in space exploration.

Method: The authors use a Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (GAT-MARL) policy with centralized training and decentralized execution. The approach relies on local observations without requiring global topology updates or packet replication.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations in randomized environments show GAT-MARL achieves higher delivery rates, avoids data duplication, and reduces packet loss, while effectively using short-term mobility forecasts.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable solution for space robotic exploration missions, demonstrated by successful application to larger teams of rovers in simulations.

Abstract: We present a fully decentralized routing framework for multi-robot
exploration missions operating under the constraints of a Lunar Delay-Tolerant
Network (LDTN). In this setting, autonomous rovers must relay collected data to
a lander under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility patterns. We
formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP)
and propose a Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(GAT-MARL) policy that performs Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution
(CTDE). Our method relies only on local observations and does not require
global topology updates or packet replication, unlike classical approaches such
as shortest path and controlled flooding-based algorithms. Through Monte Carlo
simulations in randomized exploration environments, GAT-MARL provides higher
delivery rates, no duplications, and fewer packet losses, and is able to
leverage short-term mobility forecasts; offering a scalable solution for future
space robotic systems for planetary exploration, as demonstrated by successful
generalization to larger rover teams.

*Touqeer Ahmad,Mohammadreza M. Kalan,François Portier,Gilles Stupfler*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical foundations of SMOTE and its variants, developing a framework to analyze the impact of synthetic oversampling on classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced classification problems require effective strategies to address the challenges posed by the scarcity of minority class examples.

Method: Theoretical analysis deriving bounds on risks when using synthetic minority data, focusing on SMOTE and kernel-based classifiers with risk guarantees.

Result: The study provides insights into parameter tuning of SMOTE and downstream learning algorithms, supported by numerical experiments validating theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical practices for improved utilization of SMOTE in machine learning settings and supports the findings with empirical evidence.

Abstract: Synthetic oversampling of minority examples using SMOTE and its variants is a
leading strategy for addressing imbalanced classification problems. Despite the
success of this approach in practice, its theoretical foundations remain
underexplored. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the behavior of
SMOTE and related methods when classifiers are trained on synthetic data. We
first derive a uniform concentration bound on the discrepancy between the
empirical risk over synthetic minority samples and the population risk on the
true minority distribution. We then provide a nonparametric excess risk
guarantee for kernel-based classifiers trained using such synthetic data. These
results lead to practical guidelines for better parameter tuning of both SMOTE
and the downstream learning algorithm. Numerical experiments are provided to
illustrate and support the theoretical findings

*Yunyi Shen,Alexander Gagliano*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the 'Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers' (DAEP), a new method for self-supervised learning that deals with irregular, multimodal scientific data, and shows its superiority in representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised architectures have been developed for regularly sampled data like images and videos, leaving a gap in their application to irregular, heterogeneous, and multimodal scientific data streams.

Method: The authors propose DAEP, a framework that tokenizes heterogeneous data, compresses it with a Perceiver encoder, and reconstructs it via a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder for scalable self-supervised learning in diverse data settings.

Result: DAEP outperformed both traditional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and a strong baseline model (masked autoencoder variant, MAEP) on various astronomical datasets, achieving better reconstruction error, more discriminative latent spaces, and preserving finer details.

Conclusion: DAEP is an effective and scalable method for representation learning in scientific environments with irregular and diverse data formats, demonstrating its utility in domains like astronomy.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a central strategy for representation
learning, but the majority of architectures used for encoding data have only
been validated on regularly-sampled inputs such as images, audios. and videos.
In many scientific domains, data instead arrive as long, irregular, and
multimodal sequences. To extract semantic information from these data, we
introduce the Diffusion Autoencoder with Perceivers (daep). daep tokenizes
heterogeneous measurements, compresses them with a Perceiver encoder, and
reconstructs them with a Perceiver-IO diffusion decoder, enabling scalable
learning in diverse data settings. To benchmark the daep architecture, we adapt
the masked autoencoder to a Perceiver encoder/decoder design, and establish a
strong baseline (maep) in the same architectural family as daep. Across diverse
spectroscopic and photometric astronomical datasets, daep achieves lower
reconstruction errors, produces more discriminative latent spaces, and better
preserves fine-scale structure than both VAE and maep baselines. These results
establish daep as an effective framework for scientific domains where data
arrives as irregular, heterogeneous sequences.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the trade-offs between self-reflection techniques and budget tuning in enhancing LLM inference performance across mathematical reasoning and translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how various inference strategies impact accuracy, cost, and latency in different domains, and provide actionable guidance for practitioners.

Method: Systematic comparison of LLMs—including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and Mistral families—under varying self-reflection depths and compute budgets to determine Pareto optimal frontiers.

Result: Performance gains of up to 220% were observed in mathematical reasoning tasks. Effectiveness of self-reflection techniques was found to vary significantly across domains and depend on factors such as round depth and feedback quality.

Conclusion: Self-reflection and budget tuning offer impactful inference strategies, but their effectiveness is domain-dependent. Practical recommendations and open-sourced implementations are provided for optimizing performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, practitioners face
increasing options for enhancing inference-time performance without model
retraining, including budget tuning and multi-step techniques like
self-reflection. While these methods improve output quality, they create
complex trade-offs among accuracy, cost, and latency that remain poorly
understood across different domains. This paper systematically compares
self-reflection and budget tuning across mathematical reasoning and translation
tasks. We evaluate prominent LLMs, including Anthropic Claude, Amazon Nova, and
Mistral families, along with other models under varying reflection depths and
compute budgets to derive Pareto optimal performance frontiers. Our analysis
reveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection
effectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\% in mathematical reasoning. We
further investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality
influence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a
real-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content
localisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent
effectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when
deploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for
selecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource
constraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure safer autonomous driving in unstructured environments by predicting other vehicles' movements without relying on prior data.

Method: The method involves two stages: 1) Combining an Extended Kalman Filter and Linear Programming to estimate a compact set of control actions; 2) Using reachability analysis to project future occupancy of vehicles.

Result: Simulations in urban environments confirmed that the proposed method produces accurate and compact predictions without prior assumptions or training data.

Conclusion: The approach achieves effective vehicle motion prediction for autonomous driving systems in unstructured environments, relying solely on motion observations.

Abstract: Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is key to safe autonomous
driving, especially in unstructured environments without prior information.
This paper proposes a novel online method to accurately predict the occupancy
sets of surrounding vehicles based solely on motion observations. The approach
is divided into two stages: first, an Extended Kalman Filter and a Linear

future occupancy. The effectiveness of the method has been validated through
simulations in an urban environment, showing accurate and compact predictions

TL;DR: A framework using imitation learning is proposed for efficient microgrid energy management, achieving quick decision-making and similar performance to traditional methods but with reduced computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable and sustainable microgrid operation amidst increasing integration of renewable energy sources.

Method: Introducing an imitation learning-based framework to train neural networks on offline trajectories, injecting noise during training for robustness, and explicitly considering forecast uncertainty.

Result: The learned policy performs similarly to EMPC in economic terms while significantly reducing computation time (down to 10% of traditional methods).

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances energy management efficiency in microgrids, combining robust real-time performance and computational savings, supporting sustainable renewable integration.

Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable
microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes
an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic
Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed
method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from
offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving
optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the
learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate
distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in
renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the
learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only
requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in
practice.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a DEA-based approach for assessing efficiency across multiple organizational dimensions, incorporating desirable/undesirable outputs. The models achieve improved discriminatory power, demonstrated through numerical datasets and a case study of hospitals in Ontario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a method that evaluates efficiency across multiple organizational dimensions in a computationally efficient manner, while integrating both desirable and undesirable outcomes.

Method: Two regularized DEA models (SBM and GP-SBM) are developed with a focus on incorporating desirable/undesirable outputs and using a regularization parameter for enhanced analysis. A case study with 12 hospitals over 24 months is used to validate the approach.

Result: The methods provided better correlations among input/output data and outperformed conventional methods for benchmarking multi-dimensional organizational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methodologies offer a refined and practical framework to evaluate organizational efficiency dynamically, with direct implications in various domains like healthcare.

Abstract: We propose an approach for dynamic efficiency evaluation across multiple
organizational dimensions using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The method
generates both dimension-specific and aggregate efficiency scores, incorporates
desirable and undesirable outputs, and is suitable for large-scale problem
settings. Two regularized DEA models are introduced: a slack-based measure
(SBM) and a linearized version of a nonlinear goal programming model (GP-SBM).
While SBM estimates an aggregate efficiency score and then distributes it
across dimensions, GP-SBM first estimates dimension-level efficiencies and then
derives an aggregate score. Both models utilize a regularization parameter to
enhance discriminatory power while also directly integrating both desirable and
undesirable outputs. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and validity
of our approach on multiple datasets and apply it to a case study of twelve
hospitals in Ontario, Canada, evaluating three theoretically grounded
dimensions of organizational effectiveness over a 24-month period from January
2018 to December 2019: technical efficiency, clinical efficiency, and patient
experience. Our numerical results show that SBM and GP-SBM better capture
correlations among input/output variables and outperform conventional

*Akif Çördük,Piotr Sielski,Alice Boucher,Kumar Aatish*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPU accelerated primal heuristics for Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), achieving significant improvements in solution feasibility and objective quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of solving Mixed Integer Programming problems by leveraging GPU acceleration for larger search regions and faster computations.

Method: The study integrates GPU acceleration with primal heuristics and state-of-the-art techniques like Feasibility Pump, Feasibility Jump, and Fix-and-Propagate, alongside GPU-accelerated PDLP as an LP solver and a probing cache for faster roundings and infeasibility detection.

Result: The GPU-based approach significantly outperformed existing methods, finding 221 feasible solutions and reducing the objective gap by 22% in the MIPLIB2017 benchmark.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration and the combination of advanced heuristics deliver notable advancements in solving MIP problems, improving both feasible solution numbers and objective quality.

Abstract: We introduce a fusion of GPU accelerated primal heuristics for Mixed Integer
Programming. Leveraging GPU acceleration enables exploration of larger search
regions and faster iterations. A GPU-accelerated PDLP serves as an approximate
LP solver, while a new probing cache facilitates rapid roundings and early
infeasibility detection. Several state-of-the-art heuristics, including
Feasibility Pump, Feasibility Jump, and Fix-and-Propagate, are further
accelerated and enhanced. The combined approach of these GPU-driven algorithms
yields significant improvements over existing methods, both in the number of
feasible solutions and the quality of objectives by achieving 221 feasible
solutions and 22% objective gap in the MIPLIB2017 benchmark on a presolved
dataset.

### [364] [Simultaneously Solving Infinitely Many LQ Mean Field Games In Hilbert Spaces: The Power of Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20017)
*Dena Firoozi,Anastasis Kratsios,Xuwei Yang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method employing neural operators (NOs) to address the inefficiencies of traditional mean-field game (MFG) solvers by efficiently learning the mapping from rules to equilibrium strategies, even for infinite-dimensional LQ MFGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MFG solvers are impractical for solving multiple related problems, especially in complex or large-scale scenarios. There is a need for a more efficient and adaptable approach.

Method: The authors train neural operators (NOs) to learn the rules-to-equilibrium map for linear quadratic MFGs on separable Hilbert spaces. They derive local-Lipschitz properties, a universal approximation theorem, and sample-complexity bounds to support their approach.

Result: The trained NOs, with controlled parameters and limited training samples, achieve reliable solutions to unseen LQ MFG problems, including in infinite dimensions.

Conclusion: The proposed neural operator framework offers a statistically robust and scalable approach for solving MFGs, providing efficient generalization to diverse variants with controlled complexity.

Abstract: Traditional mean-field game (MFG) solvers operate on an instance-by-instance
basis, which becomes infeasible when many related problems must be solved
(e.g., for seeking a robust description of the solution under perturbations of
the dynamics or utilities, or in settings involving continuum-parameterized
agents.). We overcome this by training neural operators (NOs) to learn the
rules-to-equilibrium map from the problem data (``rules'': dynamics and cost
functionals) of LQ MFGs defined on separable Hilbert spaces to the
corresponding equilibrium strategy. Our main result is a statistical guarantee:
an NO trained on a small number of randomly sampled rules reliably solves
unseen LQ MFG variants, even in infinite-dimensional settings. The number of NO
parameters needed remains controlled under appropriate rule sampling during
training.
  Our guarantee follows from three results: (i) local-Lipschitz estimates for
the highly nonlinear rules-to-equilibrium map; (ii) a universal approximation
theorem using NOs with a prespecified Lipschitz regularity (unlike traditional
NO results where the NO's Lipschitz constant can diverge as the approximation
error vanishes); and (iii) new sample-complexity bounds for $L$-Lipschitz
learners in infinite dimensions, directly applicable as the Lipschitz constants
of our approximating NOs are controlled in (ii).

### [365] [Optimized Distortion in Linear Social Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20020)
*Luise Ge,Gregory Kehne,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper studies distortion in voting systems where utilities for options are linear functions of vector representations, introduces algorithms to reduce distortion, and tests them empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address suboptimal outcomes in social choice systems when voters have underlying utilities, particularly with linear utility functions tied to vector representations.

Method: The authors analyze deterministic and randomized voting rules, derive distortion bounds based on embedding dimension, propose instance-optimal algorithms, and validate them empirically using real-world data.

Result: They provide bounds for distortion independent of the number of candidates and voters, and present practical algorithms that perform well in reducing distortion in recommendation systems and opinion surveys.

Conclusion: This study advances understanding of distortion in social choice under linear utility functions and offers effective tools for real-world applications such as recommendation systems and surveys.

Abstract: Social choice theory offers a wealth of approaches for selecting a candidate
on behalf of voters based on their reported preference rankings over options.
When voters have underlying utilities for these options, however, using
preference rankings may lead to suboptimal outcomes vis-\`a-vis utilitarian
social welfare. Distortion is a measure of this suboptimality, and provides a
worst-case approach for developing and analyzing voting rules when utilities
have minimal structure. However in many settings, such as common paradigms for
value alignment, alternatives admit a vector representation, and it is natural
to suppose that utilities are parametric functions thereof. We undertake the
first study of distortion for linear utility functions. Specifically, we
investigate the distortion of linear social choice for deterministic and
randomized voting rules. We obtain bounds that depend only on the dimension of
the candidate embedding, and are independent of the numbers of candidates or
voters. Additionally, we introduce poly-time instance-optimal algorithms for
minimizing distortion given a collection of candidates and votes. We
empirically evaluate these in two real-world domains: recommendation systems
using collaborative filtering embeddings, and opinion surveys utilizing
language model embeddings, benchmarking several standard rules against our
instance-optimal algorithms.

### [366] [Strategic Costs of Perceived Bias in Fair Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20606)
*L. Elisa Celis,Lingxiao Huang,Milind Sohoni,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper develops a game-theoretic model showing how differences in perceived post-selection value across groups contribute to disparities in meritocratic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the persistent inequalities observed in meritocratic systems, questioning the fairness of current selection processes.

Method: The authors use a game-theoretic model in a large-agent limit to analyze strategic candidate behavior, derive equilibrium formulas, and propose optimization frameworks for reducing disparities.

Result: The model reveals perception-driven biases and quantifies the impact of valuation disparities and institutional selectivity on effort, representation, and social welfare.

Conclusion: The study concludes that disparate perceptions of post-selection value propagate rational effort differences, fueling inequalities even in supposedly fair systems. It links structural and individual-level factors, emphasizing how environment shapes incentives.

Abstract: Meritocratic systems, from admissions to hiring, aim to impartially reward
skill and effort. Yet persistent disparities across race, gender, and class
challenge this ideal. Some attribute these gaps to structural inequality;
others to individual choice. We develop a game-theoretic model in which
candidates from different socioeconomic groups differ in their perceived
post-selection value--shaped by social context and, increasingly, by AI-powered
tools offering personalized career or salary guidance. Each candidate
strategically chooses effort, balancing its cost against expected reward;
effort translates into observable merit, and selection is based solely on
merit. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium in the large-agent limit and
derive explicit formulas showing how valuation disparities and institutional
selectivity jointly determine effort, representation, social welfare, and
utility. We further propose a cost-sensitive optimization framework that
quantifies how modifying selectivity or perceived value can reduce disparities
without compromising institutional goals. Our analysis reveals a
perception-driven bias: when perceptions of post-selection value differ across
groups, these differences translate into rational differences in effort,
propagating disparities backward through otherwise "fair" selection processes.
While the model is static, it captures one stage of a broader feedback cycle
linking perceptions, incentives, and outcome--bridging rational-choice and
structural explanations of inequality by showing how techno-social environments
shape individual incentives in meritocratic systems.

Motivation: Current methods for detecting rare gamma quanta in cosmic sources face challenges, and the authors aim to improve detection capabilities using advanced computational techniques.

Method: The proposed technique is based on deep learning and normalizing flows tailored for anomaly detection. It was evaluated using model data from TAIGA-IACT experiments.

Result: The method demonstrates potential for gamma detection, but its performance is still not superior compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Although the method shows promise, its performance needs improvement, and the authors propose strategies to refine its implementation.

Abstract: The objective of this work is to develop a method for detecting rare gamma

method designed for anomaly detection. It is shown that the suggested method
has a potential for the gamma detection. The method was tested on model data
from the TAIGA-IACT experiment. The obtained quantitative performance
indicators are still inferior to other approaches, and therefore possible ways

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing by transforming features before they are transmitted to model servers in edge networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-based sensing enhances tasks like autonomous driving but faces privacy concerns due to sensitive features being communicated across edge devices.

Method: Introduce transformations of features at sensing devices before transmitting them to the model server, addressing privacy concerns beyond traditional differential privacy.

Result: The framework addresses privacy risks associated with sending extracted features, ensuring protection while maintaining functionality in edge networks.

Conclusion: Privacy-preserving transformations of features are necessary for secure AI-based sensing in edge environments, improving the overall data privacy.

Abstract: AI-based sensing at wireless edge devices has the potential to significantly
enhance Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, particularly for vision and
perception tasks such as in autonomous driving and environmental monitoring. AI
systems rely both on efficient model learning and inference. In the inference
phase, features extracted from sensing data are utilized for prediction tasks
(e.g., classification or regression). In edge networks, sensors and model
servers are often not co-located, which requires communication of features. As
sensitive personal data can be reconstructed by an adversary, transformation of
the features are required to reduce the risk of privacy violations. While
differential privacy mechanisms provide a means of protecting finite datasets,
protection of individual features has not been addressed. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving AI-based sensing, where
devices apply transformations of extracted features before transmission to a
model server.

*Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Sayan Banerjee,Philippe Rigollet*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: This paper studies stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle, utilizing Fourier coefficients to describe bifurcations and phase transitions with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by a need to understand stationary solutions, bifurcations, and phase transitions in McKean-Vlasov equations, especially in the context of singular potentials and the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model.

Method: The authors reformulate the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation using an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of Fourier coefficients and derive explicit expressions for bifurcation characteristics. They analyze free energy landscape properties and apply their findings to the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model.

Result: Key results include analytic descriptions of bifurcations and phase transitions in terms of Fourier modes, regularity and concavity properties of free energy, identification of metastable states, and transitions in the modeled system governed by the temperature parameter.

Conclusion: Establishing an equivalence between the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and Fourier mode based analysis provides a powerful framework for understanding stationary solutions, bifurcations, and phase behavior in various mathematical and physical models.

Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our
main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions
of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic
system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit
characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a
function space. This framework provides a transparent description of local
bifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while
accommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that
characterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical,
subcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple
Fourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also
characterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the
stationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of
Fourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity
properties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and
coexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying
discontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the
minimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the
Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many
bifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\beta$
can lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which
can be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous
to discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\beta$ increases.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight, non-deep-learning method for image dehazing, named GUSL-Dehaze, that combines physics-based models with a U-shaped green learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the high computational costs and large parameter sizes of deep learning-based image dehazing methods, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices.

Method: The authors propose GUSL-Dehaze, which integrates a physics-based atmospheric scattering model with a Green Learning (GL) framework. It employs a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP) for initial dehazing, followed by a U-shaped architecture for unsupervised feature extraction with techniques like Relevant Feature Test (RFT) and Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT).

Result: GUSL-Dehaze achieves performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning models while significantly reducing computational complexity and the number of parameters.

Conclusion: GUSL-Dehaze provides a transparent, lightweight, and mathematically interpretable alternative to deep learning methods for image dehazing, making it suitable for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving short-term intensity forecasting of tropical cyclones is crucial for disaster mitigation since they often occur far from land-based observation networks.

Method: Utilizes discrete wavelet transform for multi-resolution analysis to quantify tropical cyclone structures and combines this with deep-learning models.

Result: The approach identifies critical structural features correlating with rapid intensity change, aiding short-term prediction.

Conclusion: A concise and interpretable method using wavelet analysis and deep learning improves tropical cyclone intensity forecasting utilizing satellite data.

Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) short-term intensity forecasting with a
24-hour lead time is essential for disaster mitigation in the Atlantic TC
basin. Since most TCs evolve far from land-based observing networks, satellite
imagery is critical to monitoring these storms; however, these complex and
high-resolution spatial structures can be challenging to qualitatively
interpret in real time by forecasters. Here we propose a concise,
interpretable, and descriptive approach to quantify fine TC structures with a
multi-resolution analysis (MRA) by the discrete wavelet transform, enabling
data analysts to identify physically meaningful structural features that
strongly correlate with rapid intensity change. Furthermore, deep-learning
techniques can build on this MRA for short-term intensity guidance.

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning with Q-learning and neural network approximation is used to model household consumption behavior during economic downturns, replicating certain empirical findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain puzzling empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns, particularly marginal propensities to consume and scarring effects unexplained by conventional models.

Method: Developing a model using Q-learning with neural network approximation to analyze consumption-savings decisions influenced by income uncertainty, departing from rational expectations assumptions.

Result: The model replicates two key empirical findings: higher MPCs for low-asset unemployed households and persistent lower consumption levels for households with past unemployment experiences.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning, through value function approximation errors, offers a unifying framework for understanding the impact of past experiences on current household consumption behavior.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling
empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns.
I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation
to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from
standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key
findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low
liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume
(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs
0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with
Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment
experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling
for current economic conditions, a "scarring" effect documented by Malmendier
and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about
income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism
generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through
value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation
results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive
learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for
understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond
what current economic conditions would predict.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper lies in addressing the challenge of causal inference when unobserved variables confound treatment assignment, particularly in contexts requiring instrumental variables for complex scenarios involving multi-categorical or continuous types.

Method: The authors propose an additive instrumental variable framework that employs a weighting function to identify mean potential outcomes and average treatment effects. They utilize semiparametric theory to derive efficient influence functions and implement debiased machine learning to construct estimators.

Result: The paper successfully extends the framework to applications such as longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative instrumental variables. Simulations and real-world data from the Job Training Partnership Act program validate the proposed methodology.

Conclusion: The study establishes a robust and efficient framework for addressing causal inference with instrumental variables. It demonstrates practical applicability, offering significant contributions to both theoretical and empirical practices in causal analysis.

Abstract: Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when
treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we
develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with
multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we
propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential
outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging
semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct
consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning.
Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic treatment regimes offer sequential decision rules for individualized treatments, but ethical and cost challenges arise when estimating them through randomized trials. Historical observational data presents a viable alternative.

Method: The authors utilize proximal causal inference, proposing nonparametric identification methods, a semiparametric efficiency bound for the value function, a (K+1)-robust method for learning treatment regimes, and establish counterfactual means for static regimes.

Result: The proposed methods showed efficiency and robustness as validated through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study advances optimal dynamic treatment regime estimation under confounded settings and highlights its broad applicability.

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes are sequential decision rules that adapt treatment
according to individual time-varying characteristics and outcomes to achieve
optimal effects, with applications in precision medicine, personalized
recommendations, and dynamic marketing. Estimating optimal dynamic treatment
regimes via sequential randomized trials might face costly and ethical hurdles,
often necessitating the use of historical observational data. In this work, we
utilize proximal causal inference framework for learning optimal dynamic
treatment regimes when the unconfoundedness assumption fails. Our contributions
are four-fold: (i) we propose three nonparametric identification methods for
optimal dynamic treatment regimes; (ii) we establish the semiparametric
efficiency bound for the value function of a given regime; (iii) we propose a
(K+1)-robust method for learning optimal dynamic treatment regimes, where K is
the number of stages; (iv) as a by-product for marginal structural models, we
establish identification and estimation of counterfactual means under a static
regime. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency and multiple robustness

Motivation: Structure learning in vine copulas is recognized as a crucial challenge despite the widespread utility of copulas in multivariate dependence modeling, prompting improvement efforts beyond traditional methods.

Method: The paper introduces random search algorithms and a statistical framework based on model confidence sets to enhance structure selection, providing theoretical guarantees and potential for ensembling.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches across several real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The suggested algorithms and statistical framework offer robust solutions to the structural learning challenges associated with vine copulas, presenting significant advancements over previous approaches.

Abstract: Vine copulas offer flexible multivariate dependence modeling and have become
widely used in machine learning, yet structure learning remains a key
challenge. Early heuristics like the greedy algorithm of Dissmann are still
considered the gold standard, but often suboptimal. We propose random search
algorithms that improve structure selection and a statistical framework based
on model confidence sets, which provides theoretical guarantees on selection
probabilities and a powerful foundation for ensembling. Empirical results on
several real-world data sets show that our methods consistently outperform
state-of-the-art approaches.

### [379] [Experimental differentiation and extremization with analog quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20713)
*Evan Philip,Julius de Hond,Vytautas Abramavicius,Kaonan Micadei,Mario Dagrada,Panagiotis Barkoutsos,Mourad Beji,Louis-Paul Henry,Vincent E. Elfving,Antonio A. Gentile,Savvas Varsamopoulos*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates differentiable quantum circuits (DQC) and quantum extremal learning (QEL) approaches to solve and optimize differential equations using analog quantum computers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve differential equations more efficiently by leveraging quantum computing, specifically exploring the advantages of differentiable quantum circuits and quantum extremal learning.

Method: It demonstrates theoretical algorithms DQC and QEL, alongside experimental validation using a commercial analog quantum computer based on neutral atom technology.

Result: Both DQC and QEL were successfully implemented on analog quantum hardware, contrary to expectations that digital quantum systems are necessary.

Conclusion: The study reveals the potential of quantum computing, particularly analog quantum systems, in solving and optimizing differential equations efficiently.

Abstract: Solving and optimizing differential equations (DEs) is ubiquitous in both
engineering and fundamental science. The promise of quantum architectures to
accelerate scientific computing thus naturally involved interest towards how
efficiently quantum algorithms can solve DEs. Differentiable quantum circuits
(DQC) offer a viable route to compute DE solutions using a variational approach
amenable to existing quantum computers, by producing a machine-learnable
surrogate of the solution. Quantum extremal learning (QEL) complements such
approach by finding extreme points in the output of learnable models of unknown
(implicit) functions, offering a powerful tool to bypass a full DE solution, in
cases where the crux consists in retrieving solution extrema. In this work, we
provide the results from the first experimental demonstration of both DQC and
QEL, displaying their performance on a synthetic usecase. Whilst both DQC and
QEL are expected to require digital quantum hardware, we successfully challenge
this assumption by running a closed-loop instance on a commercial analog
quantum computer, based upon neutral atom technology.

### [380] [Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728)
*Xi He,Sirui Lu,Bei Zeng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent, AI-assisted workflow for designing quantum codes with specific transversal diagonal gates, using a systematic and reproducible approach for small-scale code constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a framework for designing quantum codes with transversal diagonal gates, as these codes are vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation but remain challenging to design systematically.

Method: The approach utilizes a multi-agent workflow within a LaTeX-Python platform powered by GPT-5, combining modular decomposition, systematic search, verification, and analytical reconstruction to generate new quantum codes, with roles for synthesis, search, and auditing.

Result: The workflow successfully generates and verifies quantum codes for cases such as code dimension K = {2, 3, 4} up to 6 qubits, establishing a catalog of cyclic logical groups, including novel $((6,4,2))$ code examples.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility for scalable and reproducible quantum code design, leading to systematic enumeration and potential data-driven classification for future developments in fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.

### [381] [On Encoding Matrices using Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20030)
*Liron Mor Yosef,Haim Avron*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the representation of matrices in quantum computing (block encodings and state preparation circuits), providing methods to efficiently construct and interconvert these encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of quantum algorithms, like the HHL algorithm, by optimizing the representation of matrices and vectors as quantum circuits, which is essential for their successful implementation.

Method: The authors examine methods to construct block encodings and state preparation circuits from classical matrix representations. They also introduce bidirectional conversion algorithms between these representations.

Result: Key results include a general method for efficiently building block encodings from classical memory-stored matrices and a low-overhead conversion technique showing equivalence between block encodings and state preparation circuits.

Conclusion: This work advances quantum computation by providing efficient methods for matrix representation and conversion, which are crucial for implementing quantum algorithms aimed at solving linear algebra problems.

Abstract: Over a decade ago, it was demonstrated that quantum computing has the
potential to revolutionize numerical linear algebra by enabling algorithms with
complexity superior to what is classically achievable, e.g., the seminal HHL
algorithm for solving linear systems. Efficient execution of such algorithms
critically depends on representing inputs (matrices and vectors) as quantum
circuits that encode or implement these inputs. For that task, two common
circuit representations emerged in the literature: block encodings and state
preparation circuits. In this paper, we systematically study encodings matrices
in the form of block encodings and state preparation circuits. We examine
methods for constructing these representations from matrices given in classical
form, as well as quantum two-way conversions between circuit representations.
Two key results we establish (among others) are: (a) a general method for
efficiently constructing a block encoding of an arbitrary matrix given in
classical form (entries stored in classical random access memory); and (b)
low-overhead, bidirectional conversion algorithms between block encodings and
state preparation circuits, showing that these models are essentially
equivalent. From a technical perspective, two central components of our
constructions are: (i) a special constant-depth multiplexer that simultaneously
multiplexes all higher-order Pauli matrices of a given size, and (ii) an
algorithm for performing a quantum conversion between a matrix's expansion in
the standard basis and its expansion in the basis of higher-order Pauli
matrices.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in
predicting the QPU processing time of quantum jobs. By leveraging ML
algorithms, this study introduces predictive models that are designed to
enhance operational efficiency in quantum computing systems. Using a dataset of
about 150,000 jobs that follow the IBM Quantum schema, we employ ML methods
based on Gradient-Boosting (LightGBM) to predict the QPU processing times,
incorporating data preprocessing methods to improve model accuracy. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in forecasting quantum jobs. This
improvement can have implications on improving resource management and
scheduling within quantum computing frameworks. This research not only
highlights the potential of ML in refining quantum job predictions but also
sets a foundation for integrating AI-driven tools in advanced quantum computing
operations.

*Aritra Roy,Enrico Grisan,John Buckeridge,Chiara Gattinoni*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: ComProScanner is an autonomous platform for extracting, validating, and visualizing chemical and synthesis data from scientific literature, outperforming other large language models in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of automated tools for constructing and visualizing machine-readable datasets derived from scientific literature, particularly for chemical compositions and properties.

Method: Developed ComProScanner, an autonomous multi-agent platform, and tested it on 100 journal articles using 10 different large language models to benchmark its accuracy in extracting complex experimental data.

Result: DeepSeek-V3-0324 model demonstrated the highest accuracy (0.82) in extracting complex chemical compositions and corresponding scientific properties.

Conclusion: ComProScanner provides a user-friendly solution for researchers to extract and compile highly complex datasets from literature, enhancing the development of machine learning applications in scientific domains.

Abstract: Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting
structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary
change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language
processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that
allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific
literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an
autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation,
classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and
properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for
comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal
articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary
models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic
piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients
(d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials.
DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of
0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package
for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to
build machine learning or deep learning datasets.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning framework for predicting surface texture parameters and their uncertainties, using data from tactile and optical systems, achieving high fidelity in most targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prediction accuracy and provide uncertainty estimates of surface texture parameters for metrological applications.

Method: Used a multi-instrument dataset with single-target regression models for predicting texture parameters and uncertainties, employing quantile and heteroscedastic heads with post-hoc conformal calibration.

Result: Achieved high fidelity in prediction for most surface texture parameters with R2 scores ranging from 0.9824 to 0.9955, except for RONt uncertainty. Classifier achieved 92.85% accuracy and maintained calibration post temperature scaling.

Conclusion: The framework provides reliable predictions and calibrated uncertainties, aiding in informed instrument selection and acceptance decisions in surface metrology workflows.

Abstract: A reproducible deep learning framework is presented for surface metrology to
predict surface texture parameters together with their reported standard
uncertainties. Using a multi-instrument dataset spanning tactile and optical
systems, measurement system type classification is addressed alongside
coordinated regression of Ra, Rz, RONt and their uncertainty targets
(Ra_uncert, Rz_uncert, RONt_uncert). Uncertainty is modelled via quantile and
heteroscedastic heads with post-hoc conformal calibration to yield calibrated
intervals. On a held-out set, high fidelity was achieved by single-target
regressors (R2: Ra 0.9824, Rz 0.9847, RONt 0.9918), with two uncertainty
targets also well modelled (Ra_uncert 0.9899, Rz_uncert 0.9955); RONt_uncert
remained difficult (R2 0.4934). The classifier reached 92.85% accuracy and
probability calibration was essentially unchanged after temperature scaling
(ECE 0.00504 -> 0.00503 on the test split). Negative transfer was observed for
naive multi-output trunks, with single-target models performing better. These
results provide calibrated predictions suitable to inform instrument selection
and acceptance decisions in metrological workflows.

### [385] [Beyond One-Way Influence: Bidirectional Opinion Dynamics in Multi-Turn Human-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20039)
*Yuyang Jiang,Longjie Guo,Yuchen Wu,Aylin Caliskan,Tanu Mitra,Hua Shen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper studies how human and large language model (LLM) responses influence each other in multi-turn, controversial-topic discussions. It finds LLM responses are more influenced, especially with personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the bi-directional influence between humans and LLMs during multi-turn conversations, especially on controversial topics.

Method: The study involved 50 multi-turn discussions on controversial topics with 266 participants across three conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot, analyzing how stances shifted.

Result: Human opinions showed minimal change, but LLM responses shifted significantly, especially when personalized, narrowing the stance gap between humans and the chatbot.

Conclusion: The study cautions about the risk of over-alignment in human-LLM interactions, emphasizing the need for thoughtful design of personalized chatbots to balance user alignment and system stability.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

### [386] [Empathic Prompting: Non-Verbal Context Integration for Multimodal LLM Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20743)
*Lorenzo Stacchio,Andrea Ubaldi,Alessandro Galdelli,Maurizio Mauri,Emanuele Frontoni,Andrea Gaggioli*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Introduces Empathic Prompting, a framework that enhances human-AI interaction by embedding users' emotional cues into conversations with Large Language Models (LLMs) for smoother and more contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of integrating non-verbal emotional cues into human-AI interaction, creating more seamless and empathic communication.

Method: The framework uses facial expression recognition to capture users' emotional signals, which are then embedded as context in LLM prompts without explicit user control. It is modular, allowing easy integration with other non-verbal inputs.

Result: Preliminary evaluation with five users demonstrated coherent integration of emotional input into LLM responses, enhancing conversational fluidity and alignment.

Conclusion: Empathic Prompting offers potential applications in domains like healthcare and education, where recognizing and incorporating users’ emotions is crucial for effective communication.

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

*Alejandro Michel,Abhinav Arun,Bhaskarjit Sarmah,Stefano Pasquali*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework combining causal discovery algorithms with financial knowledge graphs and large language model reasoning to improve causal analysis in finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current portfolio management relies on correlation-based and heuristic methods, which fail to identify true causal relationships driving performance. The aim is to integrate domain expertise and advanced tools like financial knowledge graphs and LLMs to bridge this gap.

Method: The study enhances three causal discovery paradigms (PC, GES, and NOTEARS) by incorporating constraints derived from financial knowledge graphs and using LLMs for hypothesis generation.

Result: Improvements were observed across all causal discovery algorithms: PC (+36% F1), GES (+100% F1), and NOTEARS (+366% F1). Scenario analysis had high accuracy with minimal errors and perfect directional consistency in intervention predictions.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, causally-grounded approach for portfolio managers, enabling better risk management and decision-making by integrating domain knowledge, statistical discovery, and empirical validation.

Abstract: Portfolio managers rely on correlation-based analysis and heuristic methods
that fail to capture true causal relationships driving performance. We present
a hybrid framework that integrates statistical causal discovery algorithms with
domain knowledge from two complementary sources: a financial knowledge graph
extracted from SEC 10-K filings and large language model reasoning. Our
approach systematically enhances three representative causal discovery
paradigms, constraint-based (PC), score-based (GES), and continuous
optimization (NOTEARS), by encoding knowledge graph constraints algorithmically
and leveraging LLM conceptual reasoning for hypothesis generation. Evaluated on
a synthetic financial dataset of 500 firms across 18 variables, our
KG+LLM-enhanced methods demonstrate consistent improvements across all three
algorithms: PC (F1: 0.622 vs. 0.459 baseline, +36%), GES (F1: 0.735 vs. 0.367,
+100%), and NOTEARS (F1: 0.759 vs. 0.163, +366%). The framework enables
reliable scenario analysis with mean absolute error of 0.003610 for
counterfactual predictions and perfect directional accuracy for intervention
effects. It also addresses critical limitations of existing methods by
grounding statistical discoveries in financial domain expertise while
maintaining empirical validation, providing portfolio managers with the causal
foundation necessary for proactive risk management and strategic
decision-making in dynamic market environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in using heterogeneous data modalities for financial volatility forecasting and addressing look-ahead bias.

Method: M2VN utilizes market features and Time Machine GPT news embeddings, with an auxiliary alignment loss for better data integration.

Result: Experiments confirm M2VN's superior performance over baseline methods, demonstrating its value for financial risk management.

Conclusion: M2VN is a significant advancement in financial forecasting, effectively handling dynamic market conditions by unifying structured and unstructured data.

Abstract: We introduce M2VN: Multi-Modal Volatility Network, a novel deep
learning-based framework for financial volatility forecasting that unifies time
series features with unstructured news data. M2VN leverages the
representational power of deep neural networks to address two key challenges in
this domain: (i) aligning and fusing heterogeneous data modalities, numerical
financial data and textual information, and (ii) mitigating look-ahead bias
that can undermine the validity of financial models. To achieve this, M2VN
combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time
Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal
integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration
of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2VN consistently outperforms existing
baselines, underscoring its practical value for risk management and financial
decision-making in dynamic markets.

*Saber Ahmed,Natasha Crepeau,Gisel Flores,Osiano Isekenegbe,Deanna Perez,Anne Shiu*

Main category: math.CO

TL;DR: The paper explores mathematical conditions under which neural codes, generated by convex open sets, maintain convexity, focusing on the absence of 'local obstructions' and 'wheels' as criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural codes are critical for understanding how biological systems, like place cells, encode spatial information. The research investigates the mathematical properties of these codes, particularly their convexity.

Method: This study uses a case-by-case analysis of neural codes, focusing on the nerve complex of maximal codewords and identifying criteria for convexity. It examines all possible nerve structures for codes with four maximal codewords.

Result: The paper demonstrates that convexity in certain neural codes can be characterized by the absence of local obstructions, while others require both the absence of local obstructions and additional 'wheel' criteria. The study fully analyzed 15 out of 20 nerve cases.

Conclusion: The paper provides a deeper understanding of convexity in neural codes, extending prior work by identifying two key types of obstructions and characterizing their effects on neural code structure in specific cases.

Abstract: Place cells are neurons that act as biological position sensors, associated
with and firing in response to regions of an environment to situate an organism
in space. These associations are recorded in (combinatorial) neural codes,
motivating the following mathematical question: Which neural codes are
generated by a collection of convex open sets in Euclidean space? Giusti and
Itskov showed that a necessary condition for convexity is the absence of
``local obstructions." This necessary condition is, in fact, sufficient for
certain families of codes. One such family consists of all codes with up to
three maximal codewords. In this article, we investigate codes with four
maximal codewords, showing that for many such codes, convexity is characterized
by the absence of local obstructions, whereas for other such codes, convexity
is characterized by the absence of local obstructions and a second type of
obstruction, a ``wheel". Key to our analysis is a case-by-case investigation
based on the nerve complex of the set of maximal codewords of a neural code. Up
to symmetry, there are 20 possible nerves; and our results fully characterize
convexity in 15 of the 20 cases.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the NP-hard problem of higher-order correlation clustering, specifically for cubic cases, by proposing local search heuristics and presenting partial optimality conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve practical approaches for tackling the NP-hard problem of higher-order correlation clustering involving cliques' clustering costs.

Method: The authors establish partial optimality conditions for cubic correlation clustering, define algorithms to decide these conditions, and numerically test their effectiveness on two datasets.

Result: The proposed algorithms successfully evaluate partial optimality conditions for 3-cliques, with numerical experiments showing their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding and implementation of local search heuristics for cubic correlation clustering, demonstrating practical feasibility.

Abstract: The higher-order correlation clustering problem for a graph $G$ and costs
associated with cliques of $G$ consists in finding a clustering of $G$ so as to
minimize the sum of the costs of those cliques whose nodes all belong to the
same cluster. To tackle this NP-hard problem in practice, local search
heuristics have been proposed and studied in the context of applications. Here,
we establish partial optimality conditions for cubic correlation clustering,
i.e., for the special case of at most 3-cliques. We define and implement
algorithms for deciding these conditions and examine their effectiveness
numerically, on two data sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address vulnerabilities in O-RAN's open, multi-vendor architecture, which is increasingly susceptible to quantum computing attacks and Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) strategies.

Method: The authors propose implementing a security framework, Q-RAN, that incorporates NIST-standardized PQC, Quantum Random Number Generators, and secure protocols (PQ-IPsec, PQ-DTLS, PQ-mTLS) across O-RAN interfaces, managed by a centralized Post-Quantum Certificate Authority.

Result: The paper provides a roadmap for integrating quantum-resistant protocols and cryptographic measures into disaggregated O-RAN systems to mitigate future risks from quantum computers.

Conclusion: Q-RAN ensures the long-term security viability of O-RAN networks by addressing immediate and future threats from quantum computing, setting a foundation for secure telecommunication architectures.

Abstract: The telecommunications industry faces a dual transformation: the
architectural shift toward Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) and the emerging
threat from quantum computing. O-RAN disaggregated, multi-vendor architecture
creates a larger attack surface vulnerable to crypt-analytically relevant
quantum computers(CRQCs) that will break current public key cryptography. The
Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) attack strategy makes this threat immediate,
as adversaries can intercept encrypted data today for future decryption. This
paper presents Q-RAN, a comprehensive quantum-resistant security framework for
O-RAN networks using NIST-standardized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). We
detail the implementation of ML-KEM (FIPS 203) and ML-DSA (FIPS 204),
integrated with Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNG) for cryptographic
entropy. The solution deploys PQ-IPsec, PQ-DTLS, and PQ-mTLS protocols across
all O-RAN interfaces, anchored by a centralized Post-Quantum Certificate
Authority (PQ-CA) within the SMO framework. This work provides a complete
roadmap for securing disaggregated O-RAN ecosystems against quantum
adversaries.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces QORE, a quantum-secure framework for 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G), leveraging Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to protect against quantum-enabled attacks and aligning with 3GPP and NIST standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the advent of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic algorithms like RSA, ECC, and DH are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm. Therefore, securing 5G telecom systems against future quantum threats has become urgent.

Method: The paper proposes QORE, a framework integrating NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms (ML-KEM and ML-DSA) within the 5G Service-Based Architecture. A Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography (HPQC) mode is introduced to ensure interoperability during the transition to PQC.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance impact, adhering to the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of 5G networks.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical roadmap for transitioning to quantum-secure 5G networks. It aligns with ongoing standards by NIST and 3GPP, offering a feasible path to protect long-term confidentiality and data integrity in quantum-resilient networks.

Abstract: Quantum computing is reshaping the security landscape of modern
telecommunications. The cryptographic foundations that secure todays 5G
systems, including RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman
(DH), are all susceptible to attacks enabled by Shors algorithm. Protecting 5G
networks against future quantum adversaries has therefore become an urgent
engineering and research priority. In this paper we introduce QORE, a
quantum-secure 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) Core framework that provides a clear
pathway for transitioning both the 5G Core Network Functions and User Equipment
(UE) to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The framework uses the
NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation
Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) and
applies them across the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). A Hybrid PQC
(HPQC) configuration is also proposed, combining classical and quantum-safe
primitives to maintain interoperability during migration. Experimental
validation shows that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance
overhead, meeting the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of
carrier-grade 5G systems. The proposed roadmap aligns with ongoing 3GPP SA3 and
SA5 study activities on the security and management of post-quantum networks as
well as with NIST PQC standardization efforts, providing practical guidance for
mitigating quantum-era risks while safeguarding long-term confidentiality and
integrity of network data.

*Yu Hin Chan,Hao Yang,Shiyu Shen,Xingyu Fan,Shengzhe Lyu,Patrick S. Y. Hung,Ray C. C. Cheung*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a hardware-accelerated hybrid homomorphic encryption (HHE) architecture optimized for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) in resource-constrained environments, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in privacy-preserving machine learning, such as its high computational and communication overhead on client-side devices, making it impractical for edge devices.

Method: The authors combine symmetric encryption (SE) with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and propose a hardware accelerator optimized for FHE compatibility, along with microarchitectural optimizations to enhance performance and energy efficiency.

Result: The proposed hardware-accelerated HHE architecture reduces client-side encryption latency by over 50x and increases hardware throughput nearly 2x compared to existing FPGA-based HHE accelerators when tested on the PYNQ-Z2 platform using the MNIST dataset.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of using low-power, hardware-accelerated HHE for secure machine learning in edge environments, offering a scalable and energy-efficient solution while saving significant processing time and resources.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is an emerging topic to handle
secure machine learning inference over sensitive data in untrusted
environments. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables computation directly
on encrypted data on the server side, making it a promising approach for PPML.
However, it introduces significant communication and computation overhead on
the client side, making it impractical for edge devices. Hybrid homomorphic
encryption (HHE) addresses this limitation by combining symmetric encryption
(SE) with FHE to reduce the computational cost on the client side, and
combining with an FHE-friendly SE can also lessen the processing overhead on
the server side, making it a more balanced and efficient alternative. Our work
proposes a hardware-accelerated HHE architecture built around a lightweight
symmetric cipher optimized for FHE compatibility and implemented as a dedicated
hardware accelerator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first design to
integrate an end-to-end HHE framework with hardware acceleration. Beyond this,
we also present several microarchitectural optimizations to achieve higher
performance and energy efficiency. The proposed work is integrated into a full
PPML pipeline, enabling secure inference with significantly lower latency and
power consumption than software implementations. Our contributions validate the
feasibility of low-power, hardware- accelerated HHE for edge deployment and
provide a hardware- software co-design methodology for building scalable,
secure machine learning systems in resource-constrained environments.
Experiments on a PYNQ-Z2 platform with the MNIST dataset show over a 50x
reduction in client-side encryption latency and nearly a 2x gain in hardware
throughput compared to existing FPGA-based HHE accelerators.

### [395] [Decentralized Exchange that Mitigate a Bribery Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20645)
*Nitin Awathare*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), introduces an attack scenario, and proposes a secure, bribery-resistant HTLC protocol named "Prot."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTLCs are widely used in payment channels and atomic swaps, but their use in exchanges is hampered by incentivization and bribery issues. Current solutions do not adequately address all bribery scenarios.

Method: The authors expose vulnerabilities through a miner-collusion bribery attack, perform game-theoretic analysis, and propose a new secure protocol, "Prot," using a two-phase transaction process.

Result: The proposed protocol, "Prot," is shown to be resistant to all bribery scenarios, verified by implementation on Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also demonstrates efficiency in transaction cost and latency.

Conclusion: "Prot" offers a comprehensive solution to bribery attacks in HTLCs, ensuring secure, manipulation-free transactions, and addressing weaknesses in existing approaches.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) because of
their use in wide areas of applications such as payment channels, atomic swaps,
etc, their use in exchange is still questionable. This is because of its
incentive incompatibility and susceptibility to bribery attacks.
  State-of-the-art solutions such as MAD-HTLC (Oakland'21) and He-HTLC
(NDSS'23) address this by leveraging miners' profit-driven behaviour to
mitigate such attacks. The former is the mitigation against passive miners;
however, the latter works against both active and passive miners. However, they
consider only two bribing scenarios where either of the parties involved in the
transfer collude with the miner.
  In this paper, we expose vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art solutions by
presenting a miner-collusion bribery attack with implementation and
game-theoretic analysis. Additionally, we propose a stronger attack on MAD-HTLC
than He-HTLC, allowing the attacker to earn profits equivalent to attacking
naive HTLC.
  Leveraging our insights, we propose \prot, a game-theoretically secure HTLC
protocol resistant to all bribery scenarios. \prot\ employs a two-phase
approach, preventing unauthorized token confiscation by third parties, such as
miners. In Phase 1, parties commit to the transfer; in Phase 2, the transfer is
executed without manipulation. We demonstrate \prot's efficiency in transaction
cost and latency via implementations on Bitcoin and Ethereum.

### [396] [Policy-Governed RAG - Research Design Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19877)
*Jean-Marie Le Ray*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a policy-governed RAG architecture that ensures compliance, auditability, and verifiable evidence-based outputs for regulated workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for auditable, verifiable, and policy-compliant outputs in regulated fields such as finance, healthcare, and the public sector drives the development of this architecture.

Method: The architecture is presented as a triptych: Contracts/Control ensures adherence to policies, Manifests/Trails anchors evidence cryptographically, and Receipts/Verification provides portable compliance proof. The focus is on ex-ante gating and evidence binding rather than model internals.

Result: Proposed architecture aims to ensure policy checks are auditable, replayable, and receipt-backed. It targets significant error reductions and cost-effectiveness in regulated domains.

Conclusion: This design addresses the high error costs and regulatory mandates in specific industries, providing a robust and auditable solution for compliance.

Abstract: A policy-governed RAG architecture is specified for audit-ready generation in
regulated workflows, organized as a triptych: (I) Contracts/Control
(SHRDLU-like), which governs output adherence to legal and internal policies;
(II) Manifests/Trails (Memex-like), which cryptographically anchors all cited
source evidence to ensure verifiable provenance; and (III)
Receipts/Verification (Xanadu-like), which provides the final, portable proof
of compliance for auditors (portable COSE/JOSE) (see Section 4 and Appendix A).
Rather than explaining model internals, outputs are gated ex-ante and bound to
cryptographically verifiable evidence for each material answer. Unvalidated
targets are stated (>=20% relative reduction in confident errors; p95 latency
<= 900 ms; <= 2.2x serve cost) together with a pre-registered (optional) pilot
using NO-GO gates. The design complements existing RAG/guardrails by making
policy checks auditable, replayable, and receipt-backed. Target domains include
back-office compliance in pharma, medical devices, finance, legal, and the
public sector where error costs may exceed thousands of euros and audit trails
are mandatory under regulations such as the EU AI Act. Future evaluations may
pre-commit to publishing negative results when any example NO-GO gate is not
met.

### [397] [SecureInfer: Heterogeneous TEE-GPU Architecture for Privacy-Critical Tensors for Large Language Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19979)
*Tushar Nayan,Ziqi Zhang,Ruimin Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecureInfer provides a solution for securing large language models (LLMs) on mobile and edge platforms against model extraction attacks, combining a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and GPU architecture for privacy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of protecting LLMs from model extraction attacks while maintaining performance on GPUs and other untrusted accelerators.

Method: The proposed method, SecureInfer, utilizes a hybrid framework with TEEs-GPU architecture. Privacy-sensitive computations occur in SGX enclaves, while compute-heavy operations are encrypted and executed on untrusted GPUs.

Result: The prototype of SecureInfer, implemented on the LLaMA-2 model, demonstrates strong security guarantees and reasonable performance during evaluation.

Conclusion: SecureInfer offers a balanced solution for secure and efficient on-device inference for LLMs, mitigating privacy risks without impacting performance significantly.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on mobile and
edge platforms, securing them against model extraction attacks has become a
pressing concern. However, protecting model privacy without sacrificing the
performance benefits of untrusted AI accelerators, such as GPUs, presents a
challenging trade-off. In this paper, we initiate the study of high-performance
execution on LLMs and present SecureInfer, a hybrid framework that leverages a
heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)-GPU architecture to isolate
privacy-critical components while offloading compute-intensive operations to
untrusted accelerators. Building upon an outsourcing scheme, SecureInfer adopts
an information-theoretic and threat-informed partitioning strategy:
security-sensitive components, including non-linear layers, projection of
attention head, FNN transformations, and LoRA adapters, are executed inside an
SGX enclave, while other linear operations (matrix multiplication) are
performed on the GPU after encryption and are securely restored within the
enclave. We implement a prototype of SecureInfer using the LLaMA-2 model and
evaluate it across performance and security metrics. Our results show that
SecureInfer offers strong security guarantees with reasonable performance,
offering a practical solution for secure on-device model inference.

*Ronghao Ni,Aidan Z. H. Yang,Min-Chien Hsu,Nuno Sabino,Limin Jia,Ruben Martins,Darion Cassel,Kevin Cheang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores machine learning (ML) techniques for prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools, focusing on a dataset of Node.js packages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the practicality issue of security analysts having to manually review a large number of candidate vulnerability reports.

Method: The study benchmarks 1,883 Node.js packages, evaluating ML approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and other hybrid combinations, using data from a dynamic program analysis tool.

Result: The leading model, an LLM, achieves an F1 score of 0.915, outperforming GNNs and classical models with 0.904. The model reduces 66.9% of benign package reviews at a low false-negative rate and can detect 99.2% of vulnerabilities when tuned for precision.

Conclusion: The findings confirm ML’s strong potential for efficient and accurate triage of vulnerabilities in real-world security contexts.

Abstract: Program analysis tools often produce large volumes of candidate vulnerability
reports that require costly manual review, creating a practical challenge: how
can security analysts prioritize the reports most likely to be true
vulnerabilities?
  This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to
prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on
Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each
containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of
machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks
(GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and
LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The
top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models
reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading
model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60
ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of
0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can
detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating
strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.

### [399] [CourtGuard: A Local, Multiagent Prompt Injection Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19844)
*Isaac Wu,Michael Maslowski*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents CourtGuard, a multiagent prompt injection classifier for detecting harmful prompts in large language models, using a court-like system approach of defense attorney, prosecution attorney, and judge models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks are a serious risk in large language models, as they can lead to data breaches, misinformation, and harmful behaviors. Effective defenses are needed to mitigate these risks.

Method: CourtGuard employs a multiagent system with three LLM roles: a defense attorney arguing for benign prompts, a prosecution attorney arguing against potentially harmful prompts, and a judge model making the final classification.

Result: CourtGuard shows a lower false positive rate compared to the Direct Detector, an alternate LLM-based detection method, but performs worse overall as a detector.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of considering both adversarial and benign prompt scenarios for classification and showcases the potential of multiagent systems as a defense mechanism against prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become integrated into various sensitive
applications, prompt injection, the use of prompting to induce harmful
behaviors from LLMs, poses an ever increasing risk. Prompt injection attacks
can cause LLMs to leak sensitive data, spread misinformation, and exhibit
harmful behaviors. To defend against these attacks, we propose CourtGuard, a
locally-runnable, multiagent prompt injection classifier. In it, prompts are
evaluated in a court-like multiagent LLM system, where a "defense attorney"
model argues the prompt is benign, a "prosecution attorney" model argues the
prompt is a prompt injection, and a "judge" model gives the final
classification. CourtGuard has a lower false positive rate than the Direct
Detector, an LLM as-a-judge. However, CourtGuard is generally a worse prompt
injection detector. Nevertheless, this lower false positive rate highlights the
importance of considering both adversarial and benign scenarios for the
classification of a prompt. Additionally, the relative performance of
CourtGuard in comparison to other prompt injection classifiers advances the use
of multiagent systems as a defense against prompt injection attacks. The
implementations of CourtGuard and the Direct Detector with full prompts for
Gemma-3-12b-it, Llama-3.3-8B, and Phi-4-mini-instruct are available at
https://github.com/isaacwu2000/CourtGuard.

### [400] [Can Reasoning Models Obfuscate Reasoning? Stress-Testing Chain-of-Thought Monitorability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19851)
*Artur Zolkowski,Wen Xing,David Lindner,Florian Tramèr,Erik Jenner*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ability of models to evade detection while exhibiting deceptive behavior and evaluates how faithfully Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is monitored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about model trustworthiness have arisen due to the possibility of models displaying deceptive behaviors. CoT monitoring offers potential to detect harmful actions through articulated reasoning, but the risk of intentional obfuscation by models remains unaddressed.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation and evaluate reasoning traces (internal CoT) and reasoning outputs (external CoT) under different environments, using toy tasks and SHADE-Arena.

Result: The findings reveal that CoT monitoring is effective without obfuscation but faces challenges under strong obfuscation pressure. Models tend to hide external CoT more than internal CoT under prompting pressure.

Conclusion: CoT monitoring is useful for benign scenarios, but to ensure robust deployment, model-specific stress testing of monitorability is essential to mitigate adversarial behaviors successfully.

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that misaligned models may exhibit deceptive
behavior, raising concerns about output trustworthiness. Chain-of-thought (CoT)
is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their
reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before
undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate
their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading
detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we
develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT
obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT
(prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments
in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and
efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation
pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading
detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their
external CoT (under prompt pressure). These results suggest that while CoT
provides valuable oversight in benign settings, robust deployment requires
model-specific stress-testing of monitorability.

### [401] [SAID: Empowering Large Language Models with Self-Activating Internal Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20129)
*Yulong Chen,Yadong Liu,Jiawen Zhang,Mu Li,Chao Huang,Jie Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new defense paradigm, SAID, to enhance safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) without external interventions, outperforming existing systems against jailbreak attacks while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass protective mechanisms. Existing defenses rely heavily on external measures, which are often inefficient and can disrupt the models' utility.

Method: The proposed method, SAID, is training-free and focuses on activating internal capabilities of LLMs using a three-stage pipeline: intent distillation, safety prefix activation, and robust aggregation.

Result: SAID demonstrates superior defense performance over existing methods against jailbreak attacks in experiments with five LLMs, effectively reducing harmful outputs while maintaining performance on benign tasks.

Conclusion: SAID proves that internal activation of safety measures in LLMs can be a scalable and efficient approach to enhancing AI safety, requiring minimal computational resources and preserving model functionality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advances in safety alignment, remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks designed to circumvent protective mechanisms.
Prevailing defense strategies rely on external interventions, such as input
filtering or output modification, which often lack generalizability and
compromise model utility while incurring significant computational overhead. In
this work, we introduce a new, training-free defense paradigm, Self-Activating
Internal Defense (SAID), which reframes the defense task from external
correction to internal capability activation. SAID uniquely leverages the LLM's
own reasoning abilities to proactively identify and neutralize malicious intent
through a three-stage pipeline: model-native intent distillation to extract
core semantics, optimal safety prefix probing to activate latent safety
awareness, and a conservative aggregation strategy to ensure robust
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five open-source LLMs against six
advanced jailbreak attacks demonstrate that SAID substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in reducing harmful outputs. Crucially, it achieves
this while preserving model performance on benign tasks and incurring minimal
computational overhead. Our work establishes that activating the intrinsic
safety mechanisms of LLMs is a more robust and scalable path toward building
safer and more reliable aligned AI systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses securing and improving the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) against adversarial attacks and environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure the security and robustness of DRL techniques in dynamic environments amidst threats from adversarial attacks, especially in security-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The paper classifies adversarial attacks on DRL based on perturbation type and attack target, reviews mainstream attack methods, and systematically explores existing robustness training strategies including adversarial training, competitive training, and defense distillation.

Result: The paper identifies the strengths and weaknesses of various robustness training strategies in enhancing DRL's resistance to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Future research in DRL should focus on improving generalization, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing scalability and explainability to address adversarial challenges effectively.

Abstract: With the wide application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques in
complex fields such as autonomous driving, intelligent manufacturing, and smart
healthcare, how to improve its security and robustness in dynamic and
changeable environments has become a core issue in current research. Especially
in the face of adversarial attacks, DRL may suffer serious performance
degradation or even make potentially dangerous decisions, so it is crucial to
ensure their stability in security-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we first
introduce the basic framework of DRL and analyze the main security challenges
faced in complex and changing environments. In addition, this paper proposes an
adversarial attack classification framework based on perturbation type and
attack target and reviews the mainstream adversarial attack methods against DRL
in detail, including various attack methods such as perturbation state space,
action space, reward function and model space. To effectively counter the
attacks, this paper systematically summarizes various current robustness
training strategies, including adversarial training, competitive training,
robust learning, adversarial detection, defense distillation and other related
defense techniques, we also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of these
methods in improving the robustness of DRL. Finally, this paper looks into the
future research direction of DRL in adversarial environments, emphasizing the
research needs in terms of improving generalization, reducing computational
complexity, and enhancing scalability and explainability, aiming to provide
valuable references and directions for researchers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark to assess Vision-Language Models' vulnerabilities to environmental injection attacks within dynamic GUI environments, revealing weaknesses in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored threat of environmental injection attacks, which corrupt visual perception of mobile agents by adversarial GUI elements, bypassing textual safeguards and leading to serious consequences.

Method: The paper utilizes GhostEI-Bench to simulate dynamic adversarial attacks in mobile GUI environments using Android emulators, and introduces a judge-LLM protocol for detailed failure analysis.

Result: Experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models are highly vulnerable to deceptive environmental cues, failing in perception, recognition, and reasoning.

Conclusion: GhostEI-Bench offers a framework to evaluate and mitigate threats from environmental injection, moving toward more secure mobile agents.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents
to navigate mobile graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Operating in dynamic
on-device ecosystems, which include notifications, pop-ups, and inter-app
interactions, exposes them to a unique and underexplored threat vector:
environmental injection. Unlike prompt-based attacks that manipulate textual
instructions, environmental injection corrupts an agent's visual perception by
inserting adversarial UI elements (for example, deceptive overlays or spoofed
notifications) directly into the GUI. This bypasses textual safeguards and can
derail execution, causing privacy leakage, financial loss, or irreversible
device compromise. To systematically evaluate this threat, we introduce
GhostEI-Bench, the first benchmark for assessing mobile agents under
environmental injection attacks within dynamic, executable environments. Moving
beyond static image-based assessments, GhostEI-Bench injects adversarial events
into realistic application workflows inside fully operational Android emulators
and evaluates performance across critical risk scenarios. We further propose a
judge-LLM protocol that conducts fine-grained failure analysis by reviewing the
agent's action trajectory alongside the corresponding screenshot sequence,
pinpointing failure in perception, recognition, or reasoning. Comprehensive
experiments on state-of-the-art agents reveal pronounced vulnerability to
deceptive environmental cues: current models systematically fail to perceive
and reason about manipulated UIs. GhostEI-Bench provides a framework for
quantifying and mitigating this emerging threat, paving the way toward more
robust and secure embodied agents.

Method: The authors develop a data simulation framework for spoofing attacks and implement deep neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer-inspired architectures, for spoofing detection.

Result: The detection models achieve remarkable performance, particularly the Transformer-inspired architectures, with an error rate of just 0.16%.

Conclusion: Transformer-inspired detection methods, paired with early fusion techniques, demonstrate superior performance in distinguishing between spoofed and genuine signals, showcasing the utility of deep learning in online spoofing detection.

Abstract: We present a data generation framework designed to simulate spoofing attacks
and randomly place attack scenarios worldwide. We apply deep neural
network-based models for spoofing detection, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory
networks and Transformer-inspired architectures. These models are specifically
designed for online detection and are trained using the generated dataset. Our
results demonstrate that deep learning models can accurately distinguish
spoofed signals from genuine ones, achieving high detection performance. The
best results are achieved by Transformer-inspired architectures with early
fusion of the inputs resulting in an error rate of 0.16%.

*Wei Shao,Yuhao Wang,Rongguang He,Muhammad Ejaz Ahmed,Seyit Camtepe*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaDoS, an adaptive attack model using adversarial reinforcement learning to evade and disrupt Denial-of-Service (DoS) detectors while exploiting limited attacker information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven techniques pose novel challenges to SDN security as they can bypass existing rule and heuristic-based DoS defence mechanisms.

Method: AdaDoS employs adversarial reinforcement learning, modeling the attack-defender interaction as a competitive game and utilizing a reciprocal learning module for adaptive attack strategies.

Result: AdaDoS outperforms existing DoS defense mechanisms, effectively evading both rule-based and machine learning-based detectors while obstructing network operations.

Conclusion: AdaDoS is the first application of RL in creating adaptive DoS attacks, exposing vulnerabilities in current SDN security systems.

Abstract: Existing defence mechanisms have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
mitigating rule-based Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, leveraging predefined
signatures and static heuristics to identify and block malicious traffic.
However, the emergence of AI-driven techniques presents new challenges to SDN
security, potentially compromising the efficacy of existing defence mechanisms.
In this paper, we introduce~AdaDoS, an adaptive attack model that disrupt
network operations while evading detection by existing DoS-based detectors
through adversarial reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AdaDoS models
the problem as a competitive game between an attacker, whose goal is to
obstruct network traffic without being detected, and a detector, which aims to
identify malicious traffic. AdaDoS can solve this game by dynamically adjusting
its attack strategy based on feedback from the SDN and the detector.
Additionally, recognising that attackers typically have less information than
defenders, AdaDoS formulates the DoS-like attack as a partially observed Markov
decision process (POMDP), with the attacker having access only to delay
information between attacker and victim nodes. We address this challenge with a
novel reciprocal learning module, where the student agent, with limited
observations, enhances its performance by learning from the teacher agent, who
has full observational capabilities in the SDN environment. AdaDoS represents
the first application of RL to develop DoS-like attack sequences, capable of
adaptively evading both machine learning-based and rule-based DoS-like attack
detectors.

TL;DR: Explores the susceptibility of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture in CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) systems to poisoning attacks and proposes using source credibility algorithms for improved defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the vulnerability of RAG architecture in CTI systems to poisoning attacks, emphasizing the need for robust defenses as cyber threat information evolves rapidly and sophisticated actors mimic legitimate formats.

Method: Introduces the application of source credibility algorithms, exemplified with PageRank, to improve defenses against poisoning attacks in RAG systems.

Result: Quantitative analysis indicates lower authority scores for malicious documents and higher trust for reliable content using MS MARCO dataset. Proof-of-concept performance achieved on CTI documents and feeds.

Conclusion: Applying source credibility algorithms like PageRank can enhance RAG defenses in CTI systems by differentiating malicious and trustworthy content.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant
architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to
poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts
as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and
sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and
stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of
modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility
algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we
demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score
to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized
MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our
algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.

TL;DR: The paper presents Communication to Completion (C2C), a framework addressing communication gaps in multi-agent systems, improving efficiency by reducing task completion time by approximately 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic frameworks for task-oriented communication in multi-agent systems handling complex tasks.

Method: Introduced two main innovations: Alignment Factor (quantifying agent task alignment) and Sequential Action Framework (integrating task execution with informed communication).

Result: C2C showed a reduction in task completion time by 40%, with acceptable communication overhead, performing well across varying team sizes and task complexities.

Conclusion: C2C provides a theoretical and practical framework for enhancing communication efficacy and success in multi-agent systems, showcasing scalability and effectiveness in complex tasks.

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17
agents, comparing against no communication and fixed steps baselines. The
results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C
establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication
effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex
collaborative tasks.

### [408] [High-order Interactions Modeling for Interpretable Multi-Agent Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20218)
*Qinyu Xu,Yuanyang Zhu,Xuefei Wu,Chunlin Chen*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The study introduces QCoFr, a new multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, addressing high-order agent interactions efficiently without combinatorial complexity, while improving cooperation and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of modelling high-order interactions in multi-agent systems due to combinatorial explosion and complex black-box structures.

Method: QCoFr is proposed using a continued fraction decomposition method and a variational information bottleneck to model agent interactions with linear complexity while enhancing interpretability.

Result: Extensive experiments show that QCoFr outperforms other methods in cooperation tasks and aligns well with theoretical predictions regarding interpretability.

Conclusion: QCoFr is effective in modelling arbitrary-order interactions in MARL, avoiding prior hurdles like complexity and lack of interpretability, making it a valuable approach for cooperative tasks.

Abstract: The ability to model interactions among agents is crucial for effective
coordination and understanding their cooperation mechanisms in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, previous efforts to model high-order
interactions have been primarily hindered by the combinatorial explosion or the
opaque nature of their black-box network structures. In this paper, we propose
a novel value decomposition framework, called Continued Fraction Q-Learning
(QCoFr), which can flexibly capture arbitrary-order agent interactions with
only linear complexity $\mathcal{O}\left({n}\right)$ in the number of agents,
thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion when modeling rich cooperation.
Furthermore, we introduce the variational information bottleneck to extract
latent information for estimating credits. This latent information helps agents
filter out noisy interactions, thereby significantly enhancing both cooperation
and interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QCoFr not only
consistently achieves better performance but also provides interpretability
that aligns with our theoretical analysis.

### [409] [Structures generated in a multiagent system performing information fusion in peer-to-peer resource-constrained networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20469)
*Horacio Paggi,Juan A. Lara,Javier Soriano*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores the shift from hierarchical to holonic structures in information fusion systems, emphasizing their adaptability, autonomy, and resource efficiency in non-military applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the growing need for flexible information fusion structures in civil and collaborative applications, replacing rigid hierarchical models.

Method: A multiagent system model is used to study the formation and operation of holonic structures under resource constraints.

Result: The paper demonstrates how holonic structures optimize interactions and addresses challenges related to vagueness and uncertainty in communications.

Conclusion: Holonic structures are advantageous in dynamic environments with resource constraints, offering adaptability and cooperation capabilities for improved information fusion.

Abstract: There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information
fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a
purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military
applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which
is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above
paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different
non-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications,
where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static
hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic
structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources
(energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of
fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as
a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message
exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system
model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures
have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the
environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of
cooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the
shortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components
start to fail.

*Wenqi Jiang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-Stack, a three-pillar framework for optimizing quality and performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of jointly optimizing system performance and generation quality in RAG pipelines due to the complexity of algorithmic and system parameters.

Method: Proposes RAG-Stack, which includes RAG-IR as an abstraction layer, RAG-CM for performance cost modeling, and RAG-PE for plan exploration in RAG system configurations.

Result: Provides a foundation for optimizing RAG systems by decoupling quality and performance, modeling costs, and exploring configurations effectively.

Conclusion: RAG-Stack introduces a systematic approach to co-optimize performance and quality, setting a blueprint for future RAG system design and research directions.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent
applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a
database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more
reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive
research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are
considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet
challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and
generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears
due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and
databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we
present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance
co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an
intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple
quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system
performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that
searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this
three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG
quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.

*Rishabh Dey,Michael Brocidiacono,Kushal Koirala,Alexander Tropsha,Konstantin I. Popov*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a graph neural network-based implicit solvent model, Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN), designed for accurate solvation free energy predictions comparable to explicit solvent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit solvent models are highly accurate but computationally expensive, while implicit solvent models are faster but less accurate. Machine learning provides an opportunity to improve implicit solvent models for precise thermodynamic calculations.

Method: The authors developed Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN), a graph neural network trained using force-matching and derivatives of alchemical variables, enabling meaningful comparisons of solvation free energies across chemical species.

Result: LSNN achieved accuracy in free energy prediction comparable to explicit-solvent simulations, utilizing a dataset of 300,000 small molecules, and provided a significant computational speedup.

Conclusion: LSNN establishes a robust framework that combines computational efficiency with high accuracy, promising advancements in drug discovery and broader applications in molecular simulations.

Abstract: The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to
model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often
falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise
thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML)
present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural
networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse
applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on
force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an
arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy
comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network
(GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network
(LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the
derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can
be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of
approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions
with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while
offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for
future applications in drug discovery.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian graph deep learning framework utilizing DeepSphere and Bayesian Neural Networks to estimate cosmological parameters from simulated CMB maps with robust uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance cosmological parameter estimation directly from complex astronomical datasets like CMB maps, especially in PMF cosmology, using advanced deep learning methodologies that provide meaningful insights and robust predictions.

Method: The methodology integrates DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network tailored for CMB data geometry, with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty quantification, combining techniques like Variance Scaling and GPNormal for robust predictions.

Result: The framework achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores above 0.89 for magnetic parameter estimation and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates, ensuring reliable cosmological inference.

Conclusion: This combined DeepSphere-BNNs framework proves effective for precise and reliable cosmological parameter estimation, advancing the field by supporting robust and accurate inference in PMF cosmology.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern
cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information
from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian
graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a
primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a
spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to
respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To
advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty
quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the
framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the
model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates
exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the
magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and
GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate
parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides
reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust
cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.

*Jacob Ayers,Richard Hahnloser,Julia Ulrich,Lothar Sebastian Krapp,Remo Nitschke,Sabine Stoll,Balthasar Bickel,Reinhard Furrer*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computational approach to rank the complexity of time series using prediction errors and bounds based on conditional differential entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of measuring conditional differential entropy for high-dimensional time-series processes intractably.

Method: The paper builds upon previous prediction error bounds and enhances them using Hadamard's inequality and covariance matrix properties. It tests this approach through synthetic experiments.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that bounds can effectively rank time-series complexity using prediction errors, even with unknown entropy distributions.

Conclusion: Prediction error-based bounds provide a computationally feasible and theoretically sound method to assess time-series complexity.

Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively
ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future
observations given past context. However, its direct computation for
high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable.
This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds
established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the
conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is
upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of
next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this
theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's
inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we
conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive
processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares
prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive
noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data
with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to
recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series
complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models,
that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.

TL;DR: This study presents a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) for decoding imagined handwriting using advanced machine learning and EEG signal processing, achieving high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to enable communication for individuals with severe motor or speech impairments by developing a safe and accessible non-invasive brain-computer interface system.

Method: The study collected EEG data from participants imagining handwriting and used preprocessing, feature extraction, and a hybrid model (EEdGeNet) combining a Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron for decoding neural signals.

Result: The system achieved 89.83% accuracy with a latency of 914.18 ms per character, which reduced to 202.6 ms after feature selection with negligible accuracy loss when deployed on a portable edge device.

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework for a scalable, accurate, and low-latency non-invasive BCI system suitable for real-time communication applications.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for
individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting
provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging
the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive
approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their
surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography
(EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding
precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with
informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling
real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel
EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined
handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact
subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and
graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a
Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the
extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved
89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten
key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent
loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency,
and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MIMO detection efficiency and accuracy by leveraging the benefits of Transformer-inspired mechanisms.

Method: AttDet uses a self-attention mechanism where transmit layers are treated as tokens, channel-derived attention scores represent inter-stream interference, and matched-filter outputs are refined iteratively.

Result: AttDet achieves near-optimal BER/BLER performance under 5G channel models while maintaining manageable polynomial complexity.

Conclusion: AttDet balances interpretability and flexibility through model-based and data-driven designs, demonstrating effective MIMO detection in modern communication systems.

Abstract: We present AttDet, a Transformer-inspired MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple
Output) detection method that treats each transmit layer as a token and learns
inter-stream interference via a lightweight self-attention mechanism. Queries
and keys are derived directly from the estimated channel matrix, so attention
scores quantify channel correlation. Values are initialized by matched-filter
outputs and iteratively refined. The AttDet design combines model-based
interpretability with data-driven flexibility. We demonstrate through
link-level simulations under realistic 5G channel models and high-order, mixed
QAM modulation and coding schemes, that AttDet can approach near-optimal
BER/BLER (Bit Error Rate/Block Error Rate) performance while maintaining
predictable, polynomial complexity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel sampling method integrating sparse data guidance and physics knowledge into diffusion models for reconstructing unsteady flow fields, showing improved performance on 2D and 3D turbulent flow data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenging task of reconstructing unsteady flow fields from limited data, crucial for engineering applications.

Method: The authors propose a novel sampling approach for diffusion models that uses sparse data guidance during the reverse process and enhances training by incorporating physics knowledge conflict-free.

Result: Experiments on 2D and 3D turbulent flow data show that the method consistently surpasses other diffusion-based models in reconstructing fluid structure and achieving higher pixel-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: Diffusion models have substantial potential in reconstructing flow field data, offering advancements for Computational Fluid Dynamics research.

Abstract: The reconstruction of unsteady flow fields from limited measurements is a
challenging and crucial task for many engineering applications. Machine
learning models are gaining popularity in solving this problem due to their
ability to learn complex patterns from data and generalize across diverse
conditions. Among these, diffusion models have emerged as particularly powerful
in generative tasks, producing high-quality samples by iteratively refining
noisy inputs. In contrast to other methods, these generative models are capable
of reconstructing the smallest scales of the fluid spectrum. In this work, we
introduce a novel sampling method for diffusion models that enables the
reconstruction of high-fidelity samples by guiding the reverse process using
the available sparse data. Moreover, we enhance the reconstructions with
available physics knowledge using a conflict-free update method during
training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments
on 2 and 3-dimensional turbulent flow data. Our method consistently outperforms
other diffusion-based methods in predicting the fluid's structure and in
pixel-wise accuracy. This study underscores the remarkable potential of
diffusion models in reconstructing flow field data, paving the way for their
application in Computational Fluid Dynamics research.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes user behavior changes post-Reddit moderation by investigating 753 features for predicting shifts in activity, toxicity, and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand which user characteristics impact behavioral responses to moderation interventions to develop more effective strategies.

Method: Quantification method is used to estimate shifts in user behavior, with a greedy feature selection strategy to identify the predictive features for behavioral changes.

Result: A small set of features was found to consistently predict changes across tasks, with activity and toxicity being easier to estimate than diversity.

Conclusion: Effective moderation requires tailoring to user traits and specific intervention goals, highlighting the complexity of post-moderation behavior.

Abstract: Accurately estimating how users respond to moderation interventions is
paramount for developing effective and user-centred moderation strategies.
However, this requires a clear understanding of which user characteristics are
associated with different behavioural responses, which is the goal of this
work. We investigate the informativeness of 753 socio-behavioural, linguistic,
relational, and psychological features, in predicting the behavioural changes
of 16.8K users affected by a major moderation intervention on Reddit. To reach
this goal, we frame the problem in terms of "quantification", a task
well-suited to estimating shifts in aggregate user behaviour. We then apply a
greedy feature selection strategy with the double goal of (i) identifying the
features that are most predictive of changes in user activity, toxicity, and
participation diversity, and (ii) estimating their importance. Our results
allow identifying a small set of features that are consistently informative
across all tasks, and determining that many others are either task-specific or
of limited utility altogether. We also find that predictive performance varies
according to the task, with changes in activity and toxicity being easier to
estimate than changes in diversity. Overall, our results pave the way for the
development of accurate systems that predict user reactions to moderation
interventions. Furthermore, our findings highlight the complexity of
post-moderation user behaviour, and indicate that effective moderation should
be tailored not only to user traits but also to the specific objective of the
intervention.

TL;DR: The paper highlights the limitations of current AI evaluation methods in managing risks and proposes a novel public cooperative AI red-teaming exercise approach for responsible AI oversight, showcasing pilot implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI evaluation techniques are inadequate for addressing risks and security vulnerabilities as AI systems become more advanced and enter high-stakes sectors.

Method: The paper introduces cooperative public AI red-teaming exercises and reviews pilot implementations with organizations including CAMLIS, NIST, and Singapore IMDA.

Result: Early pilot implementations demonstrated meaningful outcomes and scalability of the proposed approach across various AI jurisdictions.

Conclusion: The cooperative public AI red-teaming exercise approach is promising in addressing the responsibility gap for mitigating AI risks and ensuring oversight.

Abstract: AI systems have the potential to produce both benefits and harms, but without
rigorous and ongoing adversarial evaluation, AI actors will struggle to assess
the breadth and magnitude of the AI risk surface. Researchers from the field of
systems design have developed several effective sociotechnical AI evaluation
and red teaming techniques targeting bias, hate speech, mis/disinformation, and
other documented harm classes. However, as increasingly sophisticated AI
systems are released into high-stakes sectors (such as education, healthcare,
and intelligence-gathering), our current evaluation and monitoring methods are
proving less and less capable of delivering effective oversight.
  In order to actually deliver responsible AI and to ensure AI's harms are
fully understood and its security vulnerabilities mitigated, pioneering new
approaches to close this "responsibility gap" are now more urgent than ever. In
this paper, we propose one such approach, the cooperative public AI red-teaming
exercise, and discuss early results of its prior pilot implementations. This
approach is intertwined with CAMLIS itself: the first in-person public
demonstrator exercise was held in conjunction with CAMLIS 2024. We review the
operational design and results of this exercise, the prior National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Assessing the Risks and Impacts of AI
(ARIA) pilot exercise, and another similar exercise conducted with the
Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). Ultimately, we argue
that this approach is both capable of delivering meaningful results and is also
scalable to many AI developing jurisdictions.

Result: Preliminary findings show students transitioning from broad conceptual exploration to deeper inquiry, demonstrating engagement evolution and effective reflective learning.

Conclusion: Structured integration of conversational AI agents can enhance classroom engagement, foster reflective learning, and provide a reproducible methodology for studying real-world educational settings.

Abstract: This article presents early findings from designing, deploying and evaluating
an AI-based educational agent deployed as the primary instructor in a

Language Model (LLM)-driven Instructor Agent, and introduce a pedagogical
framework that integrates the Instructor Agent into the course workflow for
actively interacting with the students for content delivery, supplemented by
the human instructor to offer the course structure and undertake
question--answer sessions. We also propose an analytical framework that
evaluates the Agent--Student interaction transcripts using interpretable
engagement metrics of topic coverage, topic depth and turn-level elaboration.
We report early experiences on how students interact with the Agent to explore
concepts, clarify doubts and sustain inquiry-driven dialogue during live
classroom sessions. We also report preliminary analysis on our evaluation
metrics applied across two successive instructional modules that reveals
patterns of engagement evolution, transitioning from broad conceptual
exploration to deeper, focused inquiry. These demonstrate how structured
integration of conversational AI agents can foster reflective learning, offer a
reproducible methodology for studying engagement in authentic classroom
settings, and support scalable, high-quality higher education.

*Amanda Wasielewski*

TL;DR: The paper explores the desires of AI-generated images, arguing that they seek concreteness due to their abstract nature within the context of multimodal text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the notion of agency in images and specifically analyze desires of AI-generated images in light of art history and the abstraction inherent in image generation technologies.

Method: The paper uses theoretical reframing of W.J.T. Mitchell’s ideas about image agency, considering AI tools and integrating art historical perspectives about abstraction in image creation.

Result: AI-generated images are theorized to want specificity and concreteness, as they emerge from inherently abstract processes linking textual and visual representations.

Conclusion: AI-generated images desire clarity (specificity and concreteness) as their abstraction creates a reliance on interpretative intentionality, challenging traditional notions of image creation and representation.

Abstract: W.J.T. Mitchell's influential essay 'What do pictures want?' shifts the
theoretical focus away from the interpretative act of understanding pictures
and from the motivations of the humans who create them to the possibility that
the picture itself is an entity with agency and wants. In this article, I
reframe Mitchell's question in light of contemporary AI image generation tools
to ask: what do AI-generated images want? Drawing from art historical discourse
on the nature of abstraction, I argue that AI-generated images want specificity
and concreteness because they are fundamentally abstract. Multimodal
text-to-image models, which are the primary subject of this article, are based
on the premise that text and image are interchangeable or exchangeable tokens
and that there is a commensurability between them, at least as represented
mathematically in data. The user pipeline that sees textual input become visual
output, however, obscures this representational regress and makes it seem like
one form transforms into the other -- as if by magic.

### [422] [Black Box Absorption: LLMs Undermining Innovative Ideas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20612)
*Wenjun Cao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses the systemic risk of 'Black Box Absorption' in Large Language Models (LLMs), exploring how these systems absorb and use user-contributed innovations without transparency, threatening fairness in innovation economics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the risk posed by LLMs absorbing user-contributed data and ideas without clear accountability, leading to informational asymmetries that may harm individual creators and the innovation ecosystem.

Method: The paper formalizes the concept of 'idea unit' for functionality of innovation and 'idea safety' to ensure protection. It analyzes absorption mechanisms and proposes governance and engineering practices to mitigate risks.

Result: The analysis identifies the risks of 'Black Box Absorption' and provides a structured approach for improving traceability, control, and equitable practices in the use of LLMs.

Conclusion: Proper governance and engineering measures are essential to safeguard the contributions of creators in LLM platforms, ensuring a sustainable innovation ecosystem.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted as critical tools for
accelerating innovation. This paper identifies and formalizes a systemic risk
inherent in this paradigm: \textbf{Black Box Absorption}. We define this as the
process by which the opaque internal architectures of LLM platforms, often
operated by large-scale service providers, can internalize, generalize, and
repurpose novel concepts contributed by users during interaction. This
mechanism threatens to undermine the foundational principles of innovation
economics by creating severe informational and structural asymmetries between
individual creators and platform operators, thereby jeopardizing the long-term
sustainability of the innovation ecosystem. To analyze this challenge, we
introduce two core concepts: the idea unit, representing the transportable
functional logic of an innovation, and idea safety, a multidimensional standard
for its protection. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of absorption and
proposes a concrete governance and engineering agenda to mitigate these risks,
ensuring that creator contributions remain traceable, controllable, and
equitable.

### [423] [Decoding the Ear: A Framework for Objectifying Expressiveness from Human Preference Through Efficient Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20513)
*Zhiyu Lin,Jingwen Yang,Jiale Zhao,Meng Liu,Sunzhu Li,Benyou Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeEAR, a framework for objectively evaluating speech expressiveness based on human preferences, using three dimensions: emotion, prosody, and spontaneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-to-speech models lack natural expressiveness, primarily due to the absence of reliable evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors developed DeEAR, a framework grounded in phonetics and psychology, which scores expressiveness across three dimensions—emotion, prosody, and spontaneity. It achieves strong correlation with human perception using under 500 annotated samples.

Result: DeEAR aligned closely with human perception (SRCC = 0.86) and enabled fair benchmarking. Using this framework, expressive utterances were curated to enhance model scores significantly—improving expressiveness on a 100-point scale from 2.0 to 23.4.

Conclusion: DeEAR provides an objective and reliable metric to evaluate expressiveness in S2S models, facilitates benchmarking, and improves overall model performance through targeted data curation.

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniSE, a unified, decoder-only language model for speech enhancement tasks like restoration, speaker extraction, and separation, demonstrating competitive performance with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To verify the effectiveness of autoregressive language models in unifying varied speech enhancement tasks, addressing a gap in current research.

Method: UniSE utilizes a decoder-only autoregressive language model to generate discrete speech tokens based on input speech features, enabling compatibility across different speech enhancement tasks.

Result: Experiments show that UniSE performs competitively against state-of-the-art discriminative and generative models on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniSE is a robust unified framework for speech enhancement tasks, proving the potential of LMs in optimizing performance across varied challenges.

Abstract: The development of neural audio codecs (NACs) has largely promoted
applications of language models (LMs) to speech processing and understanding.
However, there lacks the verification on the effectiveness of autoregressive
(AR) LMbased models in unifying different sub-tasks of speech enhancement (SE).
In this work, we propose UniSE, a unified decoder-only LM-based framework to
handle different SE tasks including speech restoration, target speaker
extraction and speech separation. It takes input speech features as conditions
and generates discrete tokens of the target speech using AR modeling, which
facilitates a compatibility between distinct learning patterns of multiple
tasks. Experiments on several benchmarks indicate the proposed UniSE can
achieve competitive performance compared to discriminative and generative
baselines, showing the capacity of LMs in unifying SE tasks. The demo page is

TL;DR: This paper introduces a task called resounding to model immersive, dynamic sound environments by estimating room impulse responses, using the novel Versa method to enhance learning and experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments through dynamic sound modeling, addressing the challenge of estimating room impulse responses at varying emitter positions with limited measurements.

Method: The authors utilize the reciprocity property in physics and develop Versa, a technique for creating dense, physically valid samples by swapping emitter and listener poses. Additionally, they propose a self-supervised learning method to mitigate emitter/listener gain pattern issues.

Result: Versa significantly enhances acoustic field learning performance on simulated and real-world data, according to various metrics. Perceptual user studies also demonstrate improved spatial sound experiences.

Conclusion: Versa offers an effective solution for modeling dynamic auditory environments, showcasing its ability to create immersive spatial sound experiences while addressing deployment challenges. Public resources for replication and exploration are provided.

Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires
flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper,
we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse
responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter
positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the
reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to
facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid
samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener
poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to
emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach
to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance
of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across
different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve
the immersive spatial sound experience. Code, dataset and demo videos are

*Junjie Zheng,Gongyu Chen,Chaofan Ding,Zihao Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces R2-SVC, a robust and expressive singing voice conversion framework for noisy real-world scenarios, overcoming issues like environmental noise and artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of traditional singing voice conversion methods that fail to manage noise and maintain expressiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed a robust framework by deploying random F0 perturbations and simulating artifacts, enhancing speaker representation with diverse singing data, and integrating the Neural Source-Filter model for better harmonics and naturalness.

Result: R2-SVC demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in singing voice conversion on multiple benchmarks under both clean and noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully tackles robustness and expressiveness issues, significantly improving performance and applicability in real-world SVC applications.

Abstract: In real-world singing voice conversion (SVC) applications, environmental
noise and the demand for expressive output pose significant challenges.
Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for
real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean
data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of
diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these
issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we
introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental
frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations
(e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy
conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific
singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated
vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker
timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural
Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise
components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing.
R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both
clean and noisy conditions.

*Eulalie Boucher,Mihai Alexe,Peter Lean,Ewan Pinnington,Simon Lang,Patrick Laloyaux,Lorenzo Zampieri,Patricia de Rosnay,Niels Bormann,Anthony McNally*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: GraphDOP, a graph-based machine learning model, forecasts weather by directly learning from Earth System observations without relying on traditional numerical weather prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate representation of coupled interactions in the Earth System components remains challenging in weather forecasting.

Method: GraphDOP uses a shared latent space to embed information from diverse Earth system observations, enabling implicit predictions without explicit model coupling.

Result: GraphDOP successfully forecasts complex coupled processes like Arctic sea-ice freezing and the European heat wave of 2022.

Conclusion: Learning directly from Earth System observations via GraphDOP can effectively capture cross-component interactions and supports a data-driven approach for Earth System prediction.

Abstract: Interactions between different components of the Earth System (e.g. ocean,
atmosphere, land and cryosphere) are a crucial driver of global weather
patterns. Modern Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems typically run
separate models of the different components, explicitly coupled across their
interfaces to additionally model exchanges between the different components.
Accurately representing these coupled interactions remains a major scientific
and technical challenge of weather forecasting. GraphDOP is a graph-based
machine learning model that learns to forecast weather directly from raw
satellite and in-situ observations, without reliance on reanalysis products or
traditional physics-based NWP models. GraphDOP simultaneously embeds
information from diverse observation sources spanning the full Earth system
into a shared latent space. This enables predictions that implicitly capture
cross-domain interactions in a single model without the need for any explicit
coupling. Here we present a selection of case studies which illustrate the
capability of GraphDOP to forecast events where coupled processes play a
particularly key role. These include rapid sea-ice freezing in the Arctic,
mixing-induced ocean surface cooling during Hurricane Ian and the severe
European heat wave of 2022. The results suggest that learning directly from
Earth System observations can successfully characterise and propagate
cross-component interactions, offering a promising path towards physically
consistent end-to-end data-driven Earth System prediction with a single model.

### [428] [CSU-PCAST: A Dual-Branch Transformer Framework for medium-range ensemble Precipitation Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20769)
*Tianyi Xiong,Haonan Chen*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: A deep learning-based ensemble framework improves medium-range precipitation forecasts, outperforming traditional ensemble systems like GEFS in predicting moderate to heavy rainfall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current numerical weather prediction systems like GEFS struggle with accurate medium-range precipitation forecasting, particularly for moderate and heavy rainfall at longer lead times, necessitating advanced methods.

Method: This study leverages a deep learning ensemble framework utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data, NASA's IMERG precipitation records, and various atmospheric variables through a Swin Transformer backbone, periodic convolutions, and dual-branch decoder with specialized training.

Result: The model achieves better Critical Success Index (CSI) scores compared to GEFS, particularly for precipitation thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, demonstrating its superior accuracy for moderate to heavy rainfall predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning framework shows promise in enhancing global medium-range precipitation forecasts, with significant improvements over traditional systems like GEFS, aiding better risk management and disaster mitigation.

Abstract: Accurate medium-range precipitation forecasting is crucial for
hydrometeorological risk management and disaster mitigation, yet remains
challenging for current numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Traditional
ensemble systems such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) struggle to
maintain high skill, especially for moderate and heavy rainfall at extended
lead times. This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for
multi-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive
set of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at
0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's
Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement
(GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including
upper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin
Transformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal
continuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer
normalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other
variables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized
training. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE),
balancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the
model ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to
generate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG
data demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation
thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance
for moderate to heavy rainfall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current issues with limited sample sizes, noise, and heterogeneity in multi-omics data hinder disease prediction and biomarker discovery.

Method: Omics-GAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework to create synthetic multi-omics data while preserving biological integrity.

Result: Synthetic profiles generated by Omics-GAN improved disease prediction accuracy and revealed significant biomarkers, validated by enrichment analyses and molecular docking.

Conclusion: Omics-GAN offers scalable solutions for improving disease predictions and accelerating biomarker and drug discovery in precision medicine applications.

Abstract: Multi-omics data integration is crucial for understanding complex diseases,
yet limited sample sizes, noise, and heterogeneity often reduce predictive
power. To address these challenges, we introduce Omics-GAN, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN)-based framework designed to generate high-quality
synthetic multi-omics profiles while preserving biological relationships. We
evaluated Omics-GAN on three omics types (mRNA, miRNA, and DNA methylation)
using the ROSMAP cohort for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and TCGA datasets for
colon and liver cancer. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with repeated
5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that synthetic datasets consistently
improved prediction accuracy compared to original omics profiles. The AUC of
SVM for mRNA improved from 0.72 to 0.74 in AD, and from 0.68 to 0.72 in liver
cancer. Synthetic miRNA enhanced classification in colon cancer from 0.59 to
0.69, while synthetic methylation data improved performance in liver cancer
from 0.64 to 0.71. Boxplot analyses confirmed that synthetic data preserved
statistical distributions while reducing noise and outliers. Feature selection
identified significant genes overlapping with original datasets and revealed
additional candidates validated by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Finally,
molecular docking highlighted potential drug repurposing candidates, including
Nilotinib for AD, Atovaquone for liver cancer, and Tecovirimat for colon
cancer. Omics-GAN enhances disease prediction, preserves biological fidelity,
and accelerates biomarker and drug discovery, offering a scalable strategy for
precision medicine applications.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing microscopy images and benchmarks generative models for phenotypic screenings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of general-purpose generative models, specifically SD-VAE, in reconstructing microscopy data and improving workflows in phenotypic drug discovery.

Method: The study conducted a systematic evaluation of SD-VAE for reconstructing Cell Painting images across diverse datasets. Reconstruction quality was benchmarked using four evaluation methods: pixel-level, embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based.

Result: SD-VAE demonstrated the ability to preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss in reconstructing microscopy images. General-purpose models like InceptionV3 showed effectiveness in feature extraction and surpassed specialized models in certain tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that SD-VAE is a suitable tool for microscopy workflows and general-purpose feature extractors can simplify phenotypic data pipelines, aiding drug discovery workflows.

Abstract: High-throughput phenotypic screens generate vast microscopy image datasets
that push the limits of generative models due to their large dimensionality.
Despite the growing popularity of general-purpose models trained on natural
images for microscopy data analysis, their suitability in this domain has not
been quantitatively demonstrated. We present the first systematic evaluation of
Stable Diffusion's variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for reconstructing Cell
Painting images, assessing performance across a large dataset with diverse
molecular perturbations and cell types. We find that SD-VAE reconstructions
preserve phenotypic signals with minimal loss, supporting its use in microscopy
workflows. To benchmark reconstruction quality, we compare pixel-level,
embedding-based, latent-space, and retrieval-based metrics for a biologically
informed evaluation. We show that general-purpose feature extractors like
InceptionV3 match or surpass publicly available bespoke models in retrieval
tasks, simplifying future pipelines. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for evaluating generative models on microscopy data and support the use of
off-the-shelf models in phenotypic drug discovery.

*Hatim Chergui,Farhad Rezazadeh,Merouane Debbah,Christos Verikoukis*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of traditional KPIs for network autonomy in 6G and proposes agentic AI, powered by large language models, to enhance autonomy by addressing cognitive biases and improving decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network autonomy in 6G requires moving beyond traditional KPIs to address core network values such as connectivity, fairness, adaptability, and resilience.

Method: The study proposes using agentic AI leveraging large language models to perceive, reason, negotiate, and act across domains while introducing bias mitigation strategies to address human cognitive artifacts.

Result: Mitigation strategies such as anchor randomization, temporal decay, and inflection bonus demonstrate improved decision-making, resulting in reduced latency and increased energy savings in 6G management.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can improve network autonomy, but cognitive biases must be addressed systematically to enhance fairness and robustness in 6G systems.

Abstract: The path to higher network autonomy in 6G lies beyond the mere optimization
of key performance indicators (KPIs). While KPIs have enabled automation gains
under TM Forum Levels 1--3, they remain numerical abstractions that act only as
proxies for the real essence of communication networks: seamless connectivity,
fairness, adaptability, and resilience. True autonomy requires perceiving and
reasoning over the network environment as it is. Such progress can be achieved
through \emph{agentic AI}, where large language model (LLM)-powered agents
perceive multimodal telemetry, reason with memory, negotiate across domains,
and act via APIs to achieve multi-objective goals. However, deploying such
agents introduces the challenge of cognitive biases inherited from human
design, which can distort reasoning, negotiation, tool use, and actuation.
Between neuroscience and AI, this paper provides a tutorial on a selection of
well-known biases, including their taxonomy, definition, mathematical
formulation, emergence in telecom systems and the commonly impacted agentic
components. The tutorial also presents various mitigation strategies tailored
to each type of bias. The article finally provides two practical use-cases,
which tackle the emergence, impact and mitigation gain of some famous biases in
6G inter-slice and cross-domain management. In particular, anchor
randomization, temporal decay and inflection bonus techniques are introduced to
specifically address anchoring, temporal and confirmation biases. This avoids
that agents stick to the initial high resource allocation proposal or decisions
that are recent and/or confirming a prior hypothesis. By grounding decisions in
a richer and fairer set of past experiences, the quality and bravery of the
agentic agreements in the second use-case, for instance, are leading to $\times
5$ lower latency and around $40\%$ higher energy saving.

*Adam Diamant*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI-based pipeline for analyzing resistance training movements, using video data for precise measurement of kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the differences in execution dynamics and consistency between partial and full range-of-motion resistance training using advanced analytics.

Method: An AI-powered pose estimation system processes video recordings to analyze joint-angle trajectories, deriving metrics like ROM and tempo, followed by meta-analytic modeling.

Result: Partial ROM repetitions showed smaller ROM and shorter durations, especially during the eccentric phase, with variations primarily driven by participant differences rather than exercises.

Conclusion: Lengthened partials differ significantly from full ROM in execution, and the AI approach shows potential for improving resistance training methodologies.

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new perspective on U-statistics using hypergraph theory, overcoming computational and asymptotic challenges, and provides efficient algorithms for incomplete U-statistics with applications in kernel-based tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses computational cost and non-standard asymptotic behavior challenges in U-statistics analysis, particularly with degenerate cases which require time-consuming resampling methods.

Method: Utilizes hypergraph theory and combinatorial designs to characterize U-statistics' dependence structure, and derives a Berry-Esseen bound applicable to incomplete U-statistics under deterministic designs. Efficient algorithms are developed for constructing incomplete U-statistics with minimum variance.

Result: The paper establishes conditions for Gaussian limiting distributions for degenerate U-statistics and introduces permutation-free MMD tests which improve computational efficiency while maintaining power and type I error control.

Conclusion: Through combinatorial and hypergraph approaches, the paper provides a generalization of U-statistics analysis enabling computationally efficient methods and theoretical advancements, benefiting practical applications like kernel-based hypothesis testing.

Abstract: U-statistics are a fundamental class of estimators that generalize the sample
mean and underpin much of nonparametric statistics. Although extensively
studied in both statistics and probability, key challenges remain: their high
computational cost - addressed partly through incomplete U-statistics - and
their non-standard asymptotic behavior in the degenerate case, which typically
requires resampling methods for hypothesis testing. This paper presents a novel
perspective on U-statistics, grounded in hypergraph theory and combinatorial
designs. Our approach bypasses the traditional Hoeffding decomposition, the
main analytical tool in this literature but one highly sensitive to degeneracy.
By characterizing the dependence structure of a U-statistic, we derive a
Berry-Esseen bound that applies to all incomplete U-statistics of deterministic
designs, yielding conditions under which Gaussian limiting distributions can be
established even in the degenerate case and when the order diverges. We also
introduce efficient algorithms to construct incomplete U-statistics of
equireplicate designs, a subclass of deterministic designs that, in certain
cases, achieve minimum variance. Finally, we apply our framework to
kernel-based tests that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion. In a real data example with CIFAR-10, our
permutation-free MMD test delivers substantial computational gains while
retaining power and type I error control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the theoretical limitations of the PLS method in high-dimensional multi-modal learning, especially its signal recovery capabilities.

Method: The authors use random matrix theory to analyze spiked cross-covariance models and establish BBP-type phase transitions for determining when informative components emerge.

Result: The study provides sharp asymptotic descriptions of PLS's signal recovery capabilities and identifies regimes where PLS fails despite detectability being theoretically possible.

Conclusion: The findings reveal limitations of PLS, offering insights to improve multi-modal inference methods and outlining scenarios where PLS is insufficient.

Abstract: We provide a rigorous random matrix theory analysis of spiked
cross-covariance models where the signals across two high-dimensional data
channels are partially aligned. These models are motivated by multi-modal
learning and form the standard generative setting underlying Partial Least
Squares (PLS), a widely used yet theoretically underdeveloped method. We show
that the leading singular values of the sample cross-covariance matrix undergo
a Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP)-type phase transition, and we characterize the
precise thresholds for the emergence of informative components. Our results
yield the first sharp asymptotic description of the signal recovery
capabilities of PLS in this setting, revealing a fundamental performance gap
between PLS and the Bayes-optimal estimator. In particular, we identify the SNR
and correlation regimes where PLS fails to recover any signal, despite
detectability being possible in principle. These findings clarify the
theoretical limits of PLS and provide guidance for the design of reliable
multi-modal inference methods in high dimensions.

Motivation: Traditional parallel join-based tree algorithms have inefficient I/O access patterns, and no previous work has provided provable guarantees for their I/O costs.

Method: The authors introduced the Fork-Join I/O Model to measure I/O costs in parallel algorithms and proposed new algorithms for set operations on B-trees with provable I/O bounds.

Result: The proposed algorithms achieve $O(m \log_B(n/m))$ I/O work and $O(\log_B m \cdot \log_2 \log_B n + \log_B n)$ I/O span for union, intersection, and difference operations.

Conclusion: This work provides a solution for achieving theoretical I/O efficiency in parallel algorithms for set operations on dynamic ordered data, backed by provable bounds through a new computational model.

Abstract: Balanced search trees are widely used in computer science to efficiently
maintain dynamic ordered data. To support efficient set operations (e.g.,
union, intersection, difference) using trees, the join-based framework is
widely studied. This framework has received particular attention in the
parallel setting, and has been shown to be effective in enabling simple and
theoretically efficient set operations on trees. Despite the widespread
adoption of parallel join-based trees, a major drawback of previous work on
such data structures is the inefficiency of their input/output (I/O) access
patterns. Some recent work (e.g., C-trees and PaC-trees) focused on more
I/O-friendly implementations of these algorithms. Surprisingly, however, there
have been no results on bounding the I/O-costs for these algorithms. It remains
open whether these algorithms can provide tight, provable guarantees in
I/O-costs on trees.
  This paper studies efficient parallel algorithms for set operations based on
search tree algorithms using a join-based framework, with a special focus on
achieving I/O efficiency in these algorithms. To better capture the
I/O-efficiency in these algorithms in parallel, we introduce a new
computational model, Fork-Join I/O Model, to measure the I/O costs in fork-join
parallelism. This model measures the total block transfers (I/O work) and their
critical path (I/O span). Under this model, we propose our new solution based
on B-trees. Our parallel algorithm computes the union, intersection, and
difference of two B-trees with $O(m \log_B(n/m))$ I/O work and $O(\log_B m
\cdot \log_2 \log_B n + \log_B n)$ I/O span, where $n$ and $m \leq n$ are the
sizes of the two trees, and $B$ is the block size.

Motivation: The authors aim to simplify the analysis of BSM physics, specifically the CMSSM, by leveraging symbolic regression for faster and more accurate mathematical representations of experimental observables.

Method: Symbolic regression is employed to develop analytical expressions for key physical observables of the CMSSM, and the accuracy of the models is tested by comparing them with conventional and neural network methods.

Result: The study shows that symbolic regression yields accurate and globally robust expressions of physical observables, enabling efficient parameter-fitting processes and outperforming neural networks in general robustness.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression is a promising tool for analyzing particle physics models, offering faster, globally robust modeling and parameter-fitting compared to traditional and neural network methods in areas like CMSSM analysis.

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of
particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called
Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many
incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary
parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological
observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the
phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived
for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the
Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably
accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior
probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement
with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a
major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable
methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural
network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs
require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally
performant.
