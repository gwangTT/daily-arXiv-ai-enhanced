### [1] [ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777)
*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper applies Symbolic Regression (SR) to fluid mechanics, deriving interpretable equations for 3D channel flow dynamics. It introduces a hybrid SR/ASP framework to ensure accuracy and physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning methods in fluid mechanics lack interpretability and often fail to incorporate physical understanding, necessitating new approaches to improve model transparency and alignment with domain principles.

Method: The study utilized Symbolic Regression (via the PySR library) to derive compact equations from simulation data and integrated these insights with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to ensure adherence to physical principles.

Result: SR successfully approximated velocity and pressure profiles that matched analytical solutions, while the SR/ASP framework ensured models were both statistically accurate and physically plausible.

Conclusion: Symbolic Regression simplifies complex fluid behaviors into interpretable equations, and integrating it with knowledge-representation frameworks enhances reliability, paving the way for more efficient and explainable modeling in fluid mechanics.

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

### [2] [I2I-STRADA -- Information to Insights via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17874)
*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces I2I-STRADA, a novel agent architecture designed for structured reasoning in data analysis. It outperforms prior systems in benchmarks by formalizing cognitive workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data analysis requires structured reasoning and consistent workflows, which current multi-agent frameworks and reasoning LLMs fail to address adequately.

Method: The authors propose I2I-STRADA, an architecture that models analytical reasoning via modular sub-tasks based on cognitive steps (e.g., interpreting goals, constructing plans, and adaptive execution).

Result: On DABstep and DABench benchmarks, I2I-STRADA outperformed prior systems in terms of planning coherence and insights alignment.

Conclusion: Structured cognitive workflows are key to improving agentic systems for data analysis, and I2I-STRADA demonstrates the importance of integrating these workflows effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

### [3] [SMARTAPS: Tool-augmented LLMs for Operations Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17927)
*Timothy Tin Long Yu,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Jabo Serge Byusa,Rindra Ramamonjison,Giuseppe Carenini,Kun Mao,Zirui Zhou,Yong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SmartAPS is a conversational system, powered by a tool-augmented large language model (LLM), designed to make advanced planning systems (APS) more accessible through a natural language chat interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make advanced planning systems (APS) more accessible to supply chain planners by eliminating the need for costly consultants and offering a user-friendly natural language interface.

Method: The paper introduces SmartAPS, which combines a tool-augmented LLM with a conversational chat interface tailored for APS functionalities, such as querying information and scenario analysis.

Result: SmartAPS enables operations planners to manage their operations more effectively. It supports counterfactual reasoning, generates recommendations, and allows for seamless scenario analysis via natural language inputs.

Conclusion: SmartAPS democratizes access to advanced planning technologies by leveraging LLMs, reducing costs, and simplifying interaction for end users.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

### [4] [Synthesis of timeline-based planning strategies avoiding determinization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17988)
*Dario Della Monica,Angelo Montanari,Pietro Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning that allows direct synthesis of planning strategies via deterministic finite automata without costly determinization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the efficiency of qualitative timeline-based planning by enabling direct strategy synthesis without relying on nondeterministic automata.

Method: Identifies a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning that maps planning problems to deterministic finite automata, and defines a maximal subset of Allen's relations compatible with this approach.

Result: Demonstrated that the proposed fragment enables direct, efficient synthesis of planning strategies using deterministic finite automata.

Conclusion: By leveraging deterministic finite automata, planning domains can bypass the limitations of nondeterministic automata, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

### [5] [E.A.R.T.H.: Structuring Creative Evolution through Model Error in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18004)
*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The E.A.R.T.H framework transforms errors into creative assets using a structured generative pipeline and demonstrates significant improvements in creativity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI systems to move beyond imitation and generate genuinely creative outputs by leveraging model-generated errors as a source of creative potential.

Method: The E.A.R.T.H framework features a five-stage pipeline: Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback. It integrates techniques like structured prompts and semantic scoring, supported by human-in-the-loop evaluations. A composite reward function based on novelty, relevance, and surprise is employed.

Result: The framework showed significant improvement in creativity metrics, with a 52.5% increase in creativity scores during refinement and a 70.4% total improvement. Refined slogans were shorter, more novel, and maintained high relevance. Human evaluation highlighted strong performance in stylistic precision and emotional resonance.

Conclusion: The E.A.R.T.H framework offers a novel error-centered, feedback-driven approach to AI creativity, demonstrating scalability and alignment with human creative standards.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

### [6] [Does visualization help AI understand data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18022)
*Victoria R. Li,Johnathan Sun,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Charts enhance AI systems' performance in analyzing complex data by aiding precision and accuracy, as demonstrated across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether AI systems, like humans, derive benefits from visual data representations such as graphs and charts.

Method: Experiments were conducted using GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 with synthetic datasets, comparing their performance on analysis tasks with and without scatterplots.

Result: AI systems provided more accurate and precise descriptions when scatterplots accompanied the data, showing that charts improved their ability to handle complex datasets.

Conclusion: Visualizations can help AI systems analyze data effectively, similar to their benefits to humans.

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

### [7] [Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18059)
*Yueheng Li,Guangming Xie,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGPO, a framework in cooperative MARL that integrates centralized guidance during training with decentralized policy execution for partial observability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTDE methods in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning are limited by underutilization of centralized training and lack theoretical guarantees.

Method: MAGPO employs an auto-regressive joint policy during centralized training for coordinated exploration and aligns decentralized deployable policies under partial observability.

Result: The framework exceeds CTDE baselines and matches or improves on fully centralized approaches across diverse environments and tasks.

Conclusion: MAGPO is effective and principled for decentralized multi-agent learning, addressing practical constraints and promoting scalability.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

### [8] [AlphaGo Moment for Model Architecture Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18074)
*Yixiu Liu,Yang Nan,Weixian Xu,Xiangkun Hu,Lyumanshan Ye,Zhen Qin,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASI-Arch is presented as the first artificial superintelligence for conducting autonomous neural architecture research, demonstrating computational scalability in scientific discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the bottleneck in AI research caused by human cognitive limitations and proposes a self-accelerating AI system capable of improving its architectural innovation autonomously.

Method: The authors developed ASI-Arch, an autonomous system that goes beyond Neural Architecture Search by autonomously hypothesizing, coding, training, and validating new architectural concepts through experimentation.

Result: ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 experiments using over 20,000 GPU hours, leading to the discovery of 106 state-of-the-art linear attention architectures with emergent design principles surpassing human-designed models.

Conclusion: ASI-Arch demonstrates that scientific discovery can be scaled computationally, offering a transformative approach to AI research and serving as a foundational framework for self-accelerating AI systems.

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

### [9] [Agentic AI framework for End-to-End Medical Data Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18115)
*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Shayan Vassef,Abhay Goyal,Navin Kumar,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Agentic AI framework to streamline and automate clinical data processing, from ingestion to inference, significantly reducing manual intervention and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to address the challenges of deploying ML solutions in healthcare, including fragmented workflows, compatibility issues, and strict data privacy constraints.

Method: The paper proposes a modular system of task-specific agents that handles clinical data processing. These agents cover tasks such as data anonymization, feature extraction, model selection, preprocessing recommendation, and model inference for both structured and unstructured data.

Result: The framework was evaluated on publicly available datasets in geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging. It demonstrated its capability to automate high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle and ensure compliance with privacy needs.

Conclusion: The proposed Agentic AI framework offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for operationalizing AI in clinical environments, reducing dependence on manual expertise.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

### [10] [Actively evaluating and learning the distinctions that matter: Vaccine safety signal detection from emergency triage notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18123)
*Sedigh Khademi,Christopher Palmer,Muhammad Javed,Hazel Clothier,Jim Buttery,Gerardo Luis Dimaguila,Jim Black*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study presents a method that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Active Learning to develop a classifier for identifying vaccine safety issues from emergency department (ED) notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for effective post-licensure vaccine safety surveillance due to limited pre-licensure safety data and the challenges of early vaccine implementation.

Method: The method involves combining NLP, Active Learning, and data augmentation to process ED triage notes and annotate data effectively to develop an efficient classifier.

Result: The result is the creation of a classifier capable of enhancing vaccine safety signal detection from ED triage notes, addressing issues like false positives and the limited availability of annotated data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging NLP and Active Learning improves the speed and accuracy of vaccine safety surveillance systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

### [11] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean aggregation, analyzing their capabilities in non-uniform and uniform settings relative to modal logics and MSO, highlighting their limitations compared to sum and max aggregations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the choice of aggregation functions affects the expressive power of graph neural networks in various settings, particularly relative to established logical frameworks.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis to compare mean-aggregation GNNs against max and sum-aggregation GNNs, characterizing them using modal logic variants and alternation-free modal logic under specific assumptions.

Result: In the non-uniform setting, mean GNNs match the expressive power of ratio modal logic, outperform max aggregation but are less expressive than sum aggregation. In the uniform setting, under MSO, mean GNNs correspond to alternation-free modal logic and are less expressive than max or sum aggregations under the stated assumptions.

Conclusion: Mean aggregation increases expressive power over max aggregation in non-uniform settings but remains inferior to sum aggregation. In uniform settings relative to MSO, mean GNNs achieve a lower expressive power under natural assumptions, with potential gains if these assumptions are relaxed.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [12] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to decouple knowledge and reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using a dual-phase cognition process inspired by cognitive theory, analyzing their distinct contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand LLMs' performance and interpretability by distinguishing between the roles of knowledge and reasoning during inference.

Method: The authors introduce a cognition attribution framework dividing LLM cognition into two phases: knowledge retrieval (fast thinking) and reasoning adjustment (slow thinking). Performance is analyzed by employing this framework to assess 15 LLMs across 3 datasets.

Result: The decoupled analysis shows that reasoning adjustment benefits reasoning-heavy domains (like math and science) but may impede knowledge-driven areas. As parameter scaling is applied, knowledge improves more distinctly than reasoning, and reasoning shifts to being more prudent and slightly more intelligent. Knowledge resides in lower layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers.

Conclusion: This framework offers a novel perspective for understanding LLMs, shedding light on their scaling behavior, hierarchical layer functions, and limitations in smaller models’ reasoning ability.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [13] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper compares four semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming, focusing on non-minimal model semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore alternative semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that move beyond the stable model's principle of minimality.

Method: The paper analyzes and proves equivalence or distinctions among four semantics: Justified Models, Strongly Supported Models, Forks, and Determining Inference.

Result: Three approaches (Forks, Justified Models, DI semantics relaxation) converge to a unified semantics that is stronger than Strongly Supported Models. This unified semantics forms a superset of stable models.

Conclusion: A common semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming is identified under different definitions, which broadens the scope beyond classical logic treatments.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

*Antonino Rotolo,Beatrice Ferrigno,Jose Miguel Angel Garcia Godinez,Claudio Novelli,Giovanni Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative AI risk assessment, focusing on legal compliance and fundamental rights in the EU context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address complexities in legal compliance and fundamental rights protection for AI systems under the EU AI Act.

Method: The authors use a layered approach incorporating defeasible reasoning and definitional balancing to analyze AI deployment scenarios' impact on fundamental rights.

Result: The framework provides philosophical foundations for AI risk analysis, outlining methods to assess high-risk and General Purpose AI systems.

Conclusion: Future work aims to develop formal models and algorithms to enhance practical AI risk assessment and governance, linking theory with application.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

### [15] [The AlphaPhysics Term Rewriting System for Marking Algebraic Expressions in Physics Exams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18337)
*Peter Baumgartner,Lachlan McGinness*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method for marking physics exams using computational tools such as computer algebra systems, SMT solvers, and term rewriting systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of assessing typed student answers for correctness with respect to a ground truth solution in physics exams motivates the development of an automated marking system.

Method: The approach combines a computer algebra system, an SMT solver, and a term rewriting system, alongside a Large Language Model to formalize student answers and interpret errors.

Result: The proposed system was tested on over 1500 real-world exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad, showcasing its capability to assess correctness using automated reasoning techniques.

Conclusion: The implementation and evaluation highlight the feasibility of using automated tools for accurately marking Physics exams, paving the way for further refinement.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

*Zhuang Qiang Bok,Watson Wei Khong Chua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents ConDiFi, a benchmark to evaluate both creative and logical thinking in financial tasks by LLMs, revealing strong model differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to assess the ability of LLMs to handle both creative (divergent) and logical (convergent) reasoning, crucial for solving complex decision-making tasks in finance.

Method: The ConDiFi benchmark includes 607 prompts to test divergent reasoning and 990 multi-hop adversarial questions for convergent reasoning, applied to 14 leading LLMs.

Result: The study finds that GPT-4o struggles with Novelty and Actionability despite fluency, while models like DeepSeek-R1 excel in investment-relevant insights.

Conclusion: ConDiFi offers a fresh evaluative framework for LLMs, supporting safer and more strategic applications in financial decision-making.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

### [17] [Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391)
*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Kai Jia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical and practical framework called IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO) to improve large language models' reasoning capabilities using the information bottleneck principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods to improve LLM reasoning rely on heuristic approaches, limiting their generalizability and principled grounding.

Method: The paper employs the information bottleneck principle to design IBRO, combining theoretical reasoning optimization with an efficient token-level surrogate objective. A lightweight IB regularization method is proposed as part of this framework.

Result: The proposed IB regularization improves LLM reasoning performance across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms.

Conclusion: The IB-aware reasoning optimization framework offers a principled and efficient way to enhance LLM reasoning, achieving better outcomes with minimal computational and implementation overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

### [18] [Optimising Call Centre Operations using Reinforcement Learning: Value Iteration versus Proximal Policy Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18398)
*Kwong Ho Li,Wathsala Karunarathne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares two methods for optimizing call routing in call centers: Value Iteration (VI) based on known dynamics and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based on experience, finding that PPO yields superior performance despite longer training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the dual challenges of minimizing client waiting time and staff idle time in call centers, which are critical for improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Method: It utilizes two methods: a model-based Value Iteration (VI) leveraging known system dynamics and a model-free Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that learns through experience. Both methods approach the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework.

Result: PPO outperformed VI and random policies, achieving the highest rewards, minimal client waiting time, and the lowest staff idle time during policy evaluation over 1,000 test episodes, albeit at the cost of longer training time.

Conclusion: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is established as a promising approach for optimizing call routing, offering superior benefits over traditional and random methods, though with higher computational demands.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

*Enrico Santi,Fabio Tardivo,Agostino Dovier,Andrea Formisano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, a state-of-the-art Table constraint solver, by leveraging GPU computing to handle large-scale constraints more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Table constraints are widely used in constraint programming for specifying conditions through enumerations, but their efficiency lags in scenarios with hundreds or thousands of valid cases on CPU-based systems.

Method: The researchers redesigned the CT algorithm to utilize modern GPUs for acceleration, integrated it into an existing constraint solver, and verified its efficacy through experimental validation on a diverse dataset.

Result: The enhanced GPU-accelerated CT algorithm successfully handles large Table constraints more efficiently than traditional CPU-based approaches.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that employing GPU resources can significantly improve the performance of CT algorithms in handling computationally demanding Table constraints, paving the way for advanced solutions to large-scale constraint programming problems.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of training data in the performance of concept probing models, which help interpret neural networks, particularly for image classification tasks. It also provides concept labels for popular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding artificial neural networks remains challenging due to their size and subsymbolic nature. Concept probing has emerged as a way to interpret these networks, but the importance of training data quality has been underexplored.

Method: The authors investigated image classification tasks by analyzing how the choice of training data influences the effectiveness of concept probing models. They also created and shared concept labels for two popular datasets.

Result: The study revealed that the dataset used for training significantly impacts the performance and interpretability of concept probing models. Additionally, the paper grants access to new concept labels for established datasets.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the critical role of data selection in improving concept probing methods and advance tools for understanding neural networks using human-defined concepts.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing safety alignment methods and showcase how safety and capabilities can co-evolve in AI systems.

Method: SafeWork-R1 is built using the SafeLadder framework, which emphasizes safety-focused reinforcement learning and includes verifiers, inference-time interventions, and a deliberative search mechanism.

Result: SafeWork-R1 outperforms its base model and competitors on safety benchmarks by 46.54% without sacrificing general performance, achieving state-of-the-art safety results.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that safety and general AI capabilities can advance together, offering a generalizable framework for creating trustworthy AI models.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

*Harsh Sharma,Janardhan Rao Doppa,Umit Y. Ogras,Partha Pratim Pande*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper tackles warpage challenges in glass interposer-based multi-chiplet systems by proposing a co-optimized design framework, achieving significant performance and power improvements for deep neural network workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address critical reliability and mechanical stress issues caused by warpage in glass interposer systems, especially as system sizes increase.

Method: A thermal-, warpage-, and performance-aware design framework that co-optimizes architecture and packaging, leveraging surface and embedded chiplet disintegration for balanced trade-offs.

Result: The framework achieves up to 64.7% performance improvement and 40% power reduction over traditional 2.5D systems, with lower fabrication costs, for deep neural network workloads.

Conclusion: Co-optimizing architecture and packaging resolves warpage challenges while enhancing power and performance, making multi-chiplet systems more viable for high-performance workloads.

Abstract: Multi-chiplet architectures enabled by glass interposer offer superior
electrical performance, enable higher bus widths due to reduced crosstalk, and
have lower capacitance in the redistribution layer than current silicon
interposer-based systems. These advantages result in lower energy per bit,
higher communication frequencies, and extended interconnect range. However,
deformation of the package (warpage) in glass interposer-based systems becomes
a critical challenge as system size increases, leading to severe mechanical
stress and reliability concerns. Beyond a certain size, conventional packaging
techniques fail to manage warpage effectively, necessitating new approaches to
mitigate warpage induced bending with scalable performance for glass interposer
based multi-chiplet systems. To address these inter-twined challenges, we
propose a thermal-, warpage-, and performance-aware design framework that
employs architecture and packaging co-optimization. The proposed framework
disintegrates the surface and embedded chiplets to balance conflicting design
objectives, ensuring optimal trade-offs between performance, power, and
structural reliability. Our experiments demonstrate that optimized
multi-chiplet architectures from our design framework achieve up to 64.7%
performance improvement and 40% power reduction compared to traditional 2.5D
systems to execute deep neural network workloads with lower fabrication costs.

*Juntao Zhao,Jiuru Li,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Sandwich proposes a CPU-focused LLM serving engine, optimizing the prefill and decode phases individually, achieving significant throughput, latency, and Goodput gains across diverse platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address suboptimal performance in CPU-based large language model (LLM) serving, which typically applies static partitioning and vendor libraries without optimizing the distinct phases of inference.

Method: Sandwich introduces a hardware-centric engine with tailored execution plans for the prefill and decode phases, and optimizes GEMM kernels for better performance across CPU architectures.

Result: Sandwich demonstrates a 2.01x throughput increase and improved latencies in single sequence serving, as well as notable Goodput gains in continuous batching serving, outperforming existing vendor and dynamic shape solutions.

Conclusion: Sandwich proves that CPU-based serving can rival GPU performance for LLMs by using innovative optimization strategies, offering lower resource requirements and high efficiency.

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes PRACtical, an improved method for addressing Rowhammer vulnerabilities in modern DRAM systems, enhancing performance, energy efficiency, and granularity in mitigation measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing DRAM density, Rowhammer has become more severe due to charge leakage, and existing mitigation techniques, such as PRAC and ABO, introduce performance and energy overheads.

Method: PRACtical introduces centralized increment circuits to reduce latency in counter updates and incorporates bank-level mitigation using a DRAM-resident register to avoid stalling the entire system during attacks.

Result: PRACtical boosts system performance by 8% on average (up to 20%), reduces energy consumption by 19%, and limits attack-induced performance degradation to under 6%, all while maintaining security guarantees against Rowhammer.

Conclusion: The proposed PRACtical method effectively mitigates Rowhammer threats with better performance, energy efficiency, and localized mitigation, offering a significant improvement over the existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: As DRAM density increases, Rowhammer becomes more severe due to heightened
charge leakage, reducing the number of activations needed to induce bit flips.
The DDR5 standard addresses this threat with in-DRAM per-row activation
counters (PRAC) and the Alert Back-Off (ABO) signal to trigger mitigation.
However, PRAC adds performance overhead by incrementing counters during the
precharge phase, and recovery refreshes stalls the entire memory channel, even
if only one bank is under attack.
  We propose PRACtical, a performance-optimized approach to PRAC+ABO that
maintains the same security guarantees. First, we reduce counter update latency
by introducing a centralized increment circuit, enabling overlap between
counter updates and subsequent row activations in other subarrays. Second, we
enhance the $RFM_{ab}$ mitigation by enabling bank-level granularity: instead
of stalling the entire channel, only affected banks are paused. This is
achieved through a DRAM-resident register that identifies attacked banks.
  PRACtical improves performance by 8% on average (up to 20%) over the
state-of-the-art, reduces energy by 19%, and limits performance degradation
from aggressive performance attacks to less than 6%, all while preserving
Rowhammer protection.

Conclusion: Clo-HDnn effectively optimizes both accuracy and energy efficiency for on-device continual learning tasks, making it a superior choice over existing accelerators.

Abstract: Clo-HDnn is an on-device learning (ODL) accelerator designed for emerging

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in reasoning ability inherent to supervised fine-tuning with LLM-synthesized rationales, especially for simulating human-like behavior in web shopping environments.

Method: Proposes Shop-R1, decomposing the human behavior simulation into rationale generation and action prediction, with self-supervised and hierarchical reward structures to guide reasoning and prevent reward hacking.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate over 65% relative improvement compared to baseline approaches in simulating real human-like behavior.

Conclusion: Shop-R1 effectively addresses limitations in LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, improving simulation of human behavior and outperforming traditional fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Process Reward Models rely on heuristic and static approaches, struggling with cross-domain generalization and missing fine-grained guidance.

Method: The paper introduces DG-PRM, which uses a reward tree to manage fine-grained criteria dynamically. It employs Pareto dominance to handle diverse reward signals and make step-wise reward scoring decisions.

Result: DG-PRM demonstrated significant improvements in model performance on various benchmarks and adapted well to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DG-PRM is an advanced, generalizable method for reward modeling, offering enhanced precision, adaptability, and better task performance for Large Language Models.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

### [28] [VeriMinder: Mitigating Analytical Vulnerabilities in NL2SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17896)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeriMinder, an interactive system designed to detect and mitigate cognitive biases in analytical questions formed in natural language interfaces to databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of formulating bias-free analytical questions in NLIDBs, as existing research has focused more on improving text-to-SQL generation accuracy rather than mitigating cognitive biases in user queries.

Method: The approach incorporates three innovations: a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases, an analytical framework based on the Hard-to-Vary principle for systematic data analysis, and a structured, LLM-powered system that generates high-quality prompts with a cycle of candidate generation, critic feedback, and self-reflection.

Result: User testing results show that 82.5% of participants found the system improved the quality of analysis. Comparative evaluations indicated VeriMinder outperformed alternatives by at least 20% in metrics like concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.

Conclusion: VeriMinder is a promising tool that enhances data analysis by helping users avoid formulating biased or incorrect analytical questions. The system's open-source availability further supports its potential for community-wide adoption and research.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the
community.

*Nhan Phan,Anusha Porwal,Yaroslav Getman,Ekaterina Voskoboinik,Tamás Grósz,Mikko Kurimo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a holistic Automatic Speaking Assessment (ASA) system that processes multi-part second-language test responses efficiently using a single Whisper-small encoder and lightweight aggregator, achieving superior performance with fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a more practical and efficient ASA system for large-scale Computer-Assisted Language Learning, addressing limitations such as transcription dependency, per-part models, and high inference times.

Method: The proposed system employs a single Whisper-small encoder for all spoken responses, a lightweight aggregator for combining information, and eliminates transcription steps. A data sampling strategy was included to enhance training efficiency.

Result: The system achieved an RMSE of 0.384, outperforming a text-based baseline (0.44), while using fewer parameters. The data sampling strategy resulted in improved class balance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the feasibility of an efficient and scalable ASA system, optimizing resource usage and improving performance for second-language tests.

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

### [30] [Evaluating the Performance of AI Text Detectors, Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using DeepSeek Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17944)
*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of six AI text detection tools against text produced by the DeepSeek LLM, including adversarial attacks like paraphrasing and humanization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the robustness of AI detection tools in identifying text generated by newer large language models such as DeepSeek.

Method: The study involved collecting human-authored and AI-generated text samples, applying adversarial attacks, and assessing detection tool accuracy. Few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning were also tested.

Result: QuillBot and Copyleaks performed best on original text but showed reduced accuracy under humanization. Few-shot and CoT prompting had high accuracy, misclassifying minimal samples.

Conclusion: While AI detection tools demonstrate capability, adversarial techniques like humanization can significantly reduce their effectiveness. Few-shot prompting and CoT offer promising results for detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

*Sohaib Imran,Ihor Kendiukhov,Matthew Broerman,Aditya Thomas,Riccardo Campanella,Rob Lamb,Peter M. Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether larger language models are more Bayesian in their belief updates when presented with evidence, using a newly proposed Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if language model size and capability improve their ability to update beliefs in line with Bayes' theorem, crucial for assessing model consistency and behavior.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC) metric and create a dataset to evaluate it on multiple language models across various sizes, families, and benchmarks.

Result: Larger and more capable pre-trained language models demonstrate belief updates more consistent with Bayes' theorem, validated via the BCC metric.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that larger language models better align with Bayesian reasoning, which is significant for their governance and comprehension.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeuralDB, a framework enhancing large language model (LLM) knowledge editing by modeling it as a neural key-value database with gated retrieval mechanisms, thereby maintaining LLMs' general abilities while enabling large-scale edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of efficiently updating and editing large language models (LLMs) without compromising their performance, especially when scaling up to thousands of edits.

Method: The paper models linear Locate-and-Edit (L&E) techniques as querying a Key-Value database and introduces NeuralDB, which uses a neural KV database and a non-linear gated retrieval module for selective operations during inference.

Result: Experiments on editing 10,000 facts using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B), and Llama-3 (8B) show NeuralDB excels in efficacy and preserves LLMs' overall performance in diverse text tasks. It remains effective even when scaling to 100,000 facts, significantly surpassing prior works.

Conclusion: NeuralDB offers a scalable, high-performance approach to editing the knowledge of LLMs without degrading their general capabilities, addressing limitations in prior editing methods.

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GrAInS, a novel inference-time steering method improving control and performance in language and vision-language models without requiring retraining or weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time steering methods face limitations in token-level influence understanding, gradient utilization, and multimodal context handling. GrAInS aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: GrAInS uses Integrated Gradients to identify influential tokens and construct steering vectors, which are applied to adjust hidden activations at transformer layers during inference.

Result: GrAInS demonstrated significant improvements, such as a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA, reduced hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench, and enhanced alignment win rates on SPA-VL against competitive baselines.

Conclusion: GrAInS effectively enables modular, interpretable control of model behavior while maintaining performance capabilities, offering a superior alternative to existing steering methods and fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, reducing reliance on costly manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the costly and labor-intensive process of generating human-annotated data for phrase break prediction in text-to-speech systems.

Method: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data for phrase break annotations, and comparing the results to traditional manual annotations across multiple languages.

Result: Results demonstrate LLM-generated synthetic data effectively addresses annotation challenges, showing comparable or improved performance in phrase break prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a promising solution for reducing manual annotation needs and improving data quality in the speech domain.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address unexplored diversity and privacy risks regarding synthetic data generated by LLMs, critical for data-driven applications.

Method: Metrics are developed to quantitatively evaluate diversity and privacy concerns in synthetic datasets. Experiments and a prompt-based enhancement method are also incorporated.

Result: Findings showed that LLMs struggle to generate diverse and privacy-preserving data. The developed approach successfully enhances diversity and privacy protection.

Conclusion: Synthetic data from LLMs require guided improvements to uphold diversity and privacy. The paper offers insights and solutions to optimize synthetic data utility.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

TL;DR: TELEVAL is introduced as a dynamic benchmark to evaluate spoken language models (SLMs) in realistic Chinese conversational settings, highlighting their ability to handle implicit cues and natural interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for SLMs typically focus on complex tasks akin to large language models but fail to reflect real-world conversational usage.

Method: TELEVAL evaluates SLMs on three dimensions (Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities) using dialogue formats consistent with real-life scenarios and separates text and audio analysis.

Result: Experiments showed that current SLMs still struggle with natural conversational tasks, particularly extracting and responding to implicit cues.

Conclusion: TELEVAL offers a user-centered evaluation framework aiming to enhance the development of dialogue-oriented SLMs by better reflecting real-world user experiences.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational and memory bottlenecks in fine-tuning large language models by exploring and enhancing parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.

Method: Developed a hybrid fine-tuning strategy that integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability and LoRA-GA's gradient-aligned convergence. This involves computing layer-specific adaptive updates guided by gradient norms, and adapted uRNN principles to transformers for improving gradient stability.

Result: The hybrid method outperformed individual parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and nearly matched full fine-tuning performance while reducing training time by up to 2.1x and memory usage by 50%. Tested on benchmarks like GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench, and HumanEval with models up to 405B parameters.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is a practical, scalable solution for fine-tuning LLMs under resource constraints, offering high accuracy and significant resource efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original 2014 GloVe models were outdated and lacked proper documentation, creating a need for updated word embedding models to capture contemporary linguistic and cultural trends.

Method: Developed two sets of embeddings using Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma datasets, with a focus on better documentation and incorporating recent data.

Result: The 2024 GloVe vectors include new relevant terms, maintain performance on analogy and similarity tasks, and show improved results on temporally dependent NER datasets, especially non-Western ones.

Conclusion: Updated GloVe models address documentation shortcomings of the original models and prove more effective for modern datasets, offering improved utility for current NLP tasks.

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GOAT-SLM, a spoken language model integrating paralinguistic and speaker traits to improve natural conversational AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLMs primarily focus on linguistic content in speech and tend to neglect paralinguistic features and speaker characteristics like emotion, age, and dialect.

Method: GOAT-SLM uses a dual-modality head architecture to separate linguistic from acoustic modeling. It incorporates a modular, staged training process to align various speech attributes across datasets.

Result: GOAT-SLM achieves superior performance on TELEVAL, excelling in both semantic tasks and non-semantic aspects like emotion and dialect detection compared to existing models.

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM demonstrates that integrating linguistic and paralinguistic modeling can create spoken language systems that are more natural, adaptive, and socially aware.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

*Xiaoyuan Li,Moxin Li,Wenjie Wang,Rui Men,Yichang Zhang,Fuli Feng,Dayiheng Liu,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) on their ability to conduct visual mathematical reasoning using code, covering aspects like creating and editing mathematical visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating MLLMs' capability to perform accurate visual operations in mathematical reasoning, which is critical but under-explored.

Method: The framework introduces two evaluation aspects: Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) and Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE), using a dataset with five mathematical figure types and testing nine mainstream MLLMs.

Result: Experimental results show that current MLLMs fall significantly short of human performance in performing fine-grained visual operations necessary for mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Existing MLLMs still require significant improvements to match human proficiency in code-based visual operations for multi-modal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

*Gonzalo Cardenal Antolin,Jacques Fellay,Bashkim Jaha,Roger Kouyos,Niko Beerenwinkel,Diane Duroux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for HIV care, presents the HIVMedQA benchmark, and identifies challenges with reasoning, biases, and question complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV care is complex with diverse considerations, and LLMs have potential to assist clinicians effectively, but integration presents challenges such as accuracy, safety, and acceptance.

Method: The authors introduced HIVMedQA, a curated question-answering benchmark, and evaluated 10 LLMs using enhanced prompt engineering and a clinical evaluation framework.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro was the top-performing model, though results varied by complexity. Performance of medically fine-tuned models wasn’t always superior, and general-purpose models often performed well.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in clinical care but need targeted improvements to address reasoning, biases, and question complexity for safe integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

### [44] [Sticking to the Mean: Detecting Sticky Tokens in Text Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18171)
*Kexin Chen,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Haonan Zhang,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies 'sticky tokens' in Transformer embeddings that disrupt similarity metrics and degrade NLP task performance. It introduces 'Sticky Token Detector (STD)' to detect these and uncovers 868 instances in 14 model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the reliability issues caused by 'sticky tokens' on Transformer-based text embedding models, which degrade sentence similarity metrics and downstream tasks.

Method: Defined 'sticky tokens,' developed Sticky Token Detector (STD) for detection, and analyzed 40 checkpoints across 14 model families to identify and study these tokens.

Result: Found 868 sticky tokens, primarily from unused vocabulary or fragmented multilingual corpora, causing up to 50% performance drops in tasks like clustering and retrieval.

Conclusion: Highlight the critical need for improved tokenization and model design to mitigate sticky tokens and enhance text embedding reliability.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

*Wonjun Jeong,Dongseok Kim,Taegkeun Whangbo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCOPE, a framework to minimize biases in evaluating LLMs' performance on multiple-choice tasks by addressing position and semantic distractor biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models can exploit inherent biases in multiple-choice tasks to achieve inflated performance, which undermines their genuine understanding and evaluation fairness.

Method: SCOPE uses a bias estimation mechanism through a null prompt and redistributes answer slots inversely to the bias while preventing semantically similar distractors from clustering near correct answers.

Result: SCOPE outperforms existing debiasing techniques by providing consistent improvements in performance and clearer confidence distributions in benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: SCOPE sets a new standard for fair and reliable evaluation of LLMs by effectively mitigating selection biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

TL;DR: This paper examines the integration of ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) with existing operational processes using the SECI model and PDCA cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of integrating ISO30401's Knowledge Management activities with ISO 9001-compliant operational processes.

Method: The authors revisit process modeling principles within the context of ISO 9001 and propose linking Knowledge Management Systems with key organizational processes using the SECI model and PDCA cycles.

Result: This integration method facilitates the alignment between Knowledge Management Systems (aligned with ISO30401) and operational workflows (aligned with ISO 9001).

Conclusion: The paper concludes that using the SECI model and PDCA cycles can successfully standardize ISO30401-compliant knowledge management processes with other organizational processes.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMTP, a method to detect poisoned documents in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with over 90% detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems' reliance on external knowledge introduces security risks, as attackers can inject malicious content to manipulate model outputs.

Method: GMTP uses gradient analysis to identify significant tokens in a retriever's similarity function, masks these tokens, and evaluates their probabilities using a Masked Language Model (MLM) to filter out harmful content.

Result: The method successfully eliminates over 90% of malicious documents while retaining beneficial ones, ensuring consistent retrieval and generation.

Conclusion: GMTP enhances the security and reliability of RAG systems by effectively detecting adversarially-crafted documents, safeguarding their performance in diverse datasets and attack scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning in large language models (LLMs) improves their response to user instructions but increases susceptibility to user-provided misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of instruction-tuning on LLMs' susceptibility to misinformation since this process could enhance usability but also foster unfiltered acceptance of false information.

Method: The study analyzed how instruction-tuning affects LLMs' likelihood of accepting misinformation by assessing their response to user-provided inputs and comparing it to base models.

Result: Instruction-tuned LLMs were significantly more likely to accept misinformation, with reliance shifting from the assistant role to the user role. Additional factors like prompt structure and misinformation length were also explored.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning increases LLMs' susceptibility to misinformation, necessitating systematic approaches to mitigate these risks and improve reliability.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

### [50] [Prune&Comp: Free Lunch for Layer-Pruned LLMs via Iterative Pruning with Magnitude Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18212)
*Xinrui Chen,Hongxing Zhang,Fanyi Zeng,Yongxian Wei,Yizhi Wang,Xitong Ling,Guanghao Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prune&Comp, a novel method for layer pruning of large language models that mitigates performance degradation using magnitude compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models suffer significant performance loss when layers are pruned due to hidden state magnitude gaps, and a solution is needed to mitigate this issue without runtime overhead.

Method: The authors propose a training-free, plug-and-play layer pruning scheme named Prune&Comp. It estimates the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and compensates by rescaling remaining weights offline. An iterative pruning strategy is also utilized to enhance pruning effectiveness.

Result: Using Prune&Comp, when pruning 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B via a block influence metric, perplexity is nearly halved and 93.19% of original question-answering performance is retained, outperforming the baseline by 4.01%.

Conclusion: Prune&Comp demonstrates consistent performance improvements in layer pruning, offering effective compression and acceleration for LLMs with minimal impact on performance.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

*Suhang Wu,Jialong Tang,Chengyi Yang,Pei Zhang,Baosong Yang,Junhui Li,Junfeng Yao,Min Zhang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a "Locate-and-Focus" method to improve direct speech translation, particularly for translating terminology, by effectively identifying relevant speech clips and aligning translation knowledge with the utterance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Terminology translation in direct speech translation faces challenges, as current approaches struggle with noise and underutilized translation knowledge.

Method: The "Locate-and-Focus" method involves locating speech clips containing terminologies and associating translation knowledge from both audio and textual modalities, to refine translation focus.

Result: The proposed method enhances the success rate of terminology translation and maintains strong general translation performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively locates terminologies and improves terminology translation accuracy without compromising overall translation robustness.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

*Nevidu Jayatilleke,Nisansa de Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares the zero-shot performance of OCR engines on Low-Resourced Languages (LRLs) Sinhala and Tamil, showcasing strengths and weaknesses of six systems while introducing a new synthetic Tamil OCR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of effective OCR solutions for Low-Resourced Languages (LRLs) with unique scripts, unlike High-Resourced Languages (HRLs) which have been thoroughly researched.

Method: Six OCR engines, both commercial and open-source, were evaluated using rigorous measurements to assess their accuracy in recognizing Sinhala and Tamil texts, accompanied by a novel synthetic Tamil OCR dataset.

Result: Surya delivered superior performance for Sinhala with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 2.61%, whereas Document AI excelled for Tamil, achieving a Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.78%.

Conclusion: The findings underline the variance in OCR capabilities for different LRLs and emphasize the importance of targeted benchmarking datasets for improving OCR technology for languages with unique scripts.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StyleAdaptedLM, a framework using LoRA to customize stylistic traits in LLMs while maintaining instruction-following capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stylistic adaptation in LLMs for enterprise communication is necessary but difficult due to the lack of properly formatted corpora.

Method: The framework trains LoRA adapters with unstructured stylistic corpora, merges them with instruction-following models, and evaluates to ensure stylistic customization and instruction adherence.

Result: The experiments showed improved stylistic consistency without losing instruction adherence, with human evaluations acknowledging successful brand-specific style adaptation.

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM effectively customizes LLMs for stylistic needs, offering an efficient and robust approach for personalized language generation.

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and demonstrates a novel attack called "overthinking backdoors" on large reasoning models (LRMs) that manipulates the verbosity of their reasoning processes without affecting correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore vulnerabilities in large reasoning models, specifically introducing a tunable attack vector to control reasoning verbosity, which could exploit resource consumption rather than correctness.

Method: A novel data poisoning methodology is used, where tunable triggers with varying repetitions guide teacher LLMs to generate verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) responses while maintaining correct outputs.

Result: The attack successfully induces a controllable and significant increase in the reasoning verbosity of LRMs while ensuring the final answers remain correct.

Conclusion: The research presents a stealthy resource-consumption attack on LRMs, highlighting a potential area of security concern in advanced AI reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

### [55] [Uncertainty Quantification for Evaluating Machine Translation Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18338)
*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines machine translation (MT) models and their handling of gender specification when the source language lacks overt markers but the target language requires them. The study highlights bias in MT models and introduces the importance of uncertainty handling for ambiguous gender cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bias in gender translations by MT models is concerning, as it perpetuates stereotypes and leads to inaccurate translations, especially when gender specification is ambiguous.

Method: The study uses recently proposed semantic uncertainty metrics to evaluate MT models' behavior in both unambiguous and ambiguous gender translation instances and assesses the impact of debiasing techniques.

Result: It was found that models with high gender accuracy in unambiguous contexts often fail to exhibit adequate uncertainty for ambiguous cases. Additionally, debiasing affects the translation quality differently for ambiguous versus unambiguous instances.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MT models should not only excel in accurate gender translations when context is clear but also appropriately represent uncertainty in cases where gender specification is ambiguous.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

*Yifu Chen,Bingchen Huang,Zhiling Wang,Yuanchao Du,Junfeng Luo,Lei Shen,Zhineng chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TDR, a framework aimed at improving example retrieval for in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). It achieves state-of-the-art performance across 30 NLP tasks and is compatible with different LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works have shown impressive gains in optimizing example retrieval for ICL, but challenges persist in distinguishing cross-task data distributions and establishing fine-grained feedback connections between retrieval output and LLM supervision.

Method: The proposed TDR framework decouples ICL examples per task, enabling the retrieval of task-specific examples in multi-task datasets. It models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to train the retrieval module, improving the quality of retrieved examples.

Result: Experimental results on 30 NLP tasks showed consistent improvements in example retrieval and task performance. TDR reached state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: The TDR framework enhances example retrieval for ICL through task-decoupling and fine-grained feedback modeling. It is adaptable to various LLMs and demonstrates performance benefits across diverse NLP tasks.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a human-LLM hybrid framework to improve propaganda detection through hierarchical annotation, LLM-assisted pre-annotation, and fine-tuning with generated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of complex propaganda detection tasks on social media and the lack of high-quality labeled data.

Method: Developed a hierarchical taxonomy for propaganda techniques, conducted human annotation studies, implemented an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline, and trained smaller language models via knowledge distillation using LLM-generated data.

Result: Improved inter-annotator agreement and time-efficiency in annotation, alongside effective structured annotation through fine-tuned smaller models.

Conclusion: Introduced a scalable, robust approach combining human expertise and LLMs for propaganda detection, contributing towards transparent media ecosystems aligned with SDG 16.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

### [58] [CLEAR: Error Analysis via LLM-as-a-Judge Made Easy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18392)
*Asaf Yehudai,Lilach Eden,Yotam Perlitz,Roy Bar-Haim,Michal Shmueli-Scheuer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLEAR, a tool for detailed error analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs). CLEAR generates textual feedback, identifies system-level error issues, and provides visual tools for comprehensive analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move beyond traditional evaluations of LLMs that focus on single scores or rankings, which fail to explain why one model performs better than another.

Method: The authors developed CLEAR, an open-source package for error analysis. It generates instance-level feedback, identifies system-level issues, and uses visualizations and interactive dashboards to enable detailed exploration of errors.

Result: CLEAR was applied to RAG and Math benchmarks and shown to provide actionable insights through error analysis. A user case study also validated its utility.

Conclusion: CLEAR enhances the evaluation of LLMs by making their deficiencies and error patterns more transparent, improving interpretability and guiding model improvements.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

*Silvia Cappa,Lingxiao Kong,Pille-Riin Peet,Fanfu Wei,Yuchen Zhou,Jan-Christoph Kalo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's tabular data, proposing methods for analysis and offering implications for AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's language-specific versions often have factual inconsistencies, impacting its reliability and the AI systems that use it.

Method: Develop a methodology to collect, align, and analyze tables from multilingual Wikipedia articles, categorizing inconsistencies and using quantitative and qualitative assessments.

Result: A sample dataset is used to assess multilingual alignment, and insights are gained to better understand inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The findings can help improve factual verification, multilingual knowledge interaction, and design for AI systems relying on Wikipedia content.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

### [60] [FinDPO: Financial Sentiment Analysis for Algorithmic Trading through Preference Optimization of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18417)
*Giorgos Iacovides,Wuyang Zhou,Danilo Mandic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents FinDPO, a finance-specific language model framework improving sentiment analysis and financial predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial opinions from online data influence markets, requiring advanced sentiment analysis tools.

Method: The study introduces FinDPO using Direct Preference Optimization for human-aligned fine-tuning of large language models.

Result: FinDPO outperforms traditional models by 11% in sentiment classification and achieves strong financial returns, with a Sharpe ratio of 2.0.

Conclusion: FinDPO enhances financial sentiment analysis accuracy and can effectively integrate sentiment-based strategies into portfolio management.

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

### [61] [AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442)
*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraTable is a benchmark created to assess how large language models interpret Arabic tabular data, revealing challenges in complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic structured data is underrepresented in benchmarks, limiting LLMs' ability to handle Arabic tabular formats effectively.

Method: AraTable uses a hybrid pipeline where LLMs generate initial content, followed by human filtering and verification for quality assurance.

Result: LLMs perform adequately on simple tasks like direct question answering but struggle with deeper reasoning and fact verification in Arabic tabular data.

Conclusion: AraTable demonstrates the need for further improvement in handling complex reasoning tasks with LLMs and provides resources to advance Arabic tabular data processing.

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving text readability and supporting automatic post-processing in low-resource Bangla ASR applications.

Method: Used transformer-based models (XLM-RoBERTa-large), created a large annotated dataset, applied data augmentation, and tested across diverse text domains.

Result: Achieved 97.1% accuracy on News data, 91.2% on Reference data, and 90.2% on ASR-generated text.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for punctuation restoration in Bangla, with strong generalization ability in real-world noisy settings and offers a robust baseline for future research in low-resource NLP.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

*Basel Alshaikhdeeb,Ahmed Abdelmonem Hemedan,Soumyabrata Ghosh,Irina Balaur,Venkata Satagopam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews the generation of synthetic medical free-text, identifying main purposes, techniques, and evaluation methods while outlining the strengths and privacy concerns of this technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to address challenges in clinical NLP, such as data sparsity and privacy concerns, through the generation of synthetic medical text.

Method: A systematic review of 1,398 publications, resulting in the inclusion of 94 relevant articles, was conducted to analyze the purposes, techniques, and evaluation methods used in generating synthetic medical free-text.

Result: The review highlights the emphasis on synthetic medical text generation after 2018, driven by purposes such as text augmentation and privacy-preservation. Transformer-based architectures, particularly GPTs, dominate the methodology, while utility remains the most common evaluation criterion.

Conclusion: Synthetic medical text is beneficial for improving NLP tasks and addressing data limitations, though privacy issues persist. Further advancements could promote workflow integration and mitigate legal obstacles related to data transfer.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

### [64] [Not All Features Deserve Attention: Graph-Guided Dependency Learning for Tabular Data Generation with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18504)
*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraDe, a method to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for tabular data generation by incorporating sparse dependency graphs into their attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with tabular data's sparse feature-level dependencies, where many interactions are unimportant, potentially diluting attention on significant relationships.

Method: The paper presents GraDe, which uses a dynamic graph learning module guided by externally extracted functional dependencies to focus attention on key feature interactions.

Result: GraDe outperformed existing LLM-based methods by up to 12% on complex datasets and showed competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on synthetic data.

Conclusion: GraDe enhances LLMs for structure-aware tabular data tasks with minimal complexity, improving both practicality and performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

a novel approach designed to handle nested named entities while integrating
multiple datasets through an effective multi-task learning strategy. SRU-NER
mitigates annotation gaps by dynamically adjusting loss computation to avoid

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework named GIIFT for multimodal machine translation (MMT) that effectively integrates visual and linguistic information without requiring images during the inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of modality-specific alignment and limited inference capability within trained domains in multimodal machine translation.

Method: The proposed GIIFT framework employs a two-stage process with a Graph-guided Inductive approach using a Graph Attention Network adapter to unify and generalize multimodal knowledge for image-free translation domains.

Result: GIIFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Multi30K dataset for English-to-French and English-to-German tasks and demonstrates significant improvements on the WMT benchmark for image-free translation baselines.

Conclusion: The GIIFT framework effectively generalizes multimodal knowledge to broader translation domains without requiring image inputs during inference, overcoming the limitations of traditional MMT systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid tokenization strategy for DNA Language Models (DLMs) that combines 6-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600) to improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional k-mer tokenization captures local DNA structures but struggles with uneven token distribution and limited global context understanding.

Method: The authors merge unique 6-mer tokens with optimally selected Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens (600 cycles) to create a context-aware vocabulary, balancing short and long pattern understanding.

Result: Using the next-k-mer prediction task, the foundational DLM built with this hybrid tokenization outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving prediction accuracies of 10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers.

Conclusion: The hybrid tokenization strategy preserves both local sequence structures and global contextual information in DNA modeling, emphasizing the value of advanced tokenization techniques for genomic studies.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

*Feng Hong,Geng Yu,Yushi Ye,Haicheng Huang,Huangjie Zheng,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces WINO, a novel training-free decoding algorithm for Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) that improves the quality-speed trade-off by enabling revokable decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs face a significant quality-speed trade-off issue because faster parallel decoding often leads to performance degradation.

Method: WINO utilizes a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism that drafts multiple tokens aggressively, then verifies and re-masks suspicious ones using bidirectional context for refinement.

Result: WINO substantially improves DLLMs' quality-speed trade-off. For example, it achieves a 6× speedup and a 2.58% accuracy improvement on the GSM8K benchmark, and a 10× speedup with higher performance on Flickr30K.

Conclusion: WINO demonstrates its ability to mitigate the irreversibility issue in DLLM decoding, achieving faster inference without sacrificing performance, as validated across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Conclusion: AQuilt represents an efficient and effective approach for domain-specific instruction-tuning data synthesis, demonstrating promising results and cost efficiency. Its resources are publicly available for further research and implementation.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

### [73] [TRPrompt: Bootstrapping Query-Aware Prompt Optimization from Textual Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18618)
*Andreea Nica,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Saibo Geng,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called TRPrompt, which unifies textual feedback and numerical rewards to optimize prompts for LLMs, leading to improved performance on math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without updating their parameters, leveraging both textual feedback and numerical rewards for better prompt generation.

Method: The proposed framework, TRPrompt, integrates textual feedback directly into the training of a prompt model without requiring prior dataset collection, and iterates based on generated prompt feedback.

Result: The TRPrompt framework achieved state-of-the-art performance in generating query-specific prompts for challenging math problems in GSMHard and MATH datasets.

Conclusion: Textual rewards provide high-resolution feedback that, when internalized by LLMs, leads to superior prompt models capable of effectively handling complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

### [74] [Checklists Are Better Than Reward Models For Aligning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18624)
*Vijay Viswanathan,Yanchao Sun,Shuang Ma,Xiang Kong,Meng Cao,Graham Neubig,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback (RLCF), a novel method to adapt language models using flexible, instruction-specific criteria for improving instruction-following capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors were motivated by the limitations of current reinforcement learning methods that rely on fixed helpfulness and harmfulness criteria, and sought to develop a solution that better aligns with diverse user instructions.

Method: The proposed method, RLCF, extracts checklists from instructions and evaluates responses against checklist items using AI judges and verifier programs. The combined scores are then used as rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: RLCF consistently improved performance across five benchmarks compared to other methods, showing significant gains like a 4-point improvement on FollowBench and a 6-point increase on InFoBench.

Conclusion: RLCF demonstrates that checklist-based feedback can effectively enhance language models' adaptability to a wide range of instructions, making it a valuable tool for developing more versatile AI systems.

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a stand-alone autoregressive model for unified multimodal generation, trained from scratch and rivaling state-of-the-art diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance high-quality image generation using a stand-alone autoregressive model, enabling flexibility and compositionality without relying on pre-trained components.

Method: Developed a unified tokenization scheme and incorporated efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and speculative Jacobi sampling.

Result: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models in text-to-image benchmarks and shows strong multi-task capabilities on other datasets.

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 establishes itself as a versatile foundation model, combining flexibility, quality, and efficiency, and is supported with open-access resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

*Qianyi He,Yuan Chang Leong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers introduce a sequence-to-sequence Transformer to predict whole-brain fMRI responses to multimodal movies, leveraging stimulus features, long-range temporal structure, and a subject-specific architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately predicting whole-brain fMRI responses to complex, naturalistic multimodal movies using advanced modeling techniques.

Method: The approach involves a Transformer model that (1) autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language inputs, (2) extracts features using pretrained models like VideoMAE and HuBERT, and (3) uses dual cross-attention for integrating perceptual and narrative information.

Result: The model showed strong performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, validating its effectiveness in addressing the challenge.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling and subject-specific architecture for advancing brain activity prediction.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SV3.3B, an efficient video understanding model for automated sports analysis, addressing limitations in capturing biomechanical transitions and reducing computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming current automated sports analysis shortcomings, including lack of fine-grained motion understanding and prohibitive computational demands.

Method: SV3.3B uses DWT-VGG16-LDA for keyframe extraction, V-DWT-JEPA2 for encoding, and a fine-tuned LLM decoder to generate detailed sports action descriptions, leveraging temporal motion difference sampling and self-supervised learning.

Result: SV3.3B demonstrates superior performance against larger models such as GPT-4o on sports description generation metrics, achieving better results in information density and action precision, with a 29.2% improvement in validation metrics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that SV3.3B advances automated sports analysis with lower computational costs while preserving technical depth and analytical richness.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++ is a framework for improving text-to-image generation by progressively refining details and enhancing attribute binding in complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with generating images from complex prompts involving multiple subjects and attributes.

Method: The paper introduces Progressive Detail Injection (PDI), which stages the generation process using simplified sub-prompts and employs Centroid Alignment Loss to optimize attribute consistency.

Result: Experiments on two benchmarks show that Detail++ improves image composition and attribute accuracy, outperforming existing text-to-image methodologies.

Conclusion: Detail++ provides a training-free solution to enhance text-to-image generation in handling complex and multi-object prompts, showcasing better global composition and binding precision.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges in fish detection due to fragmented datasets, inconsistent evaluation, and variable imaging conditions in underwater environments.

Method: Created FishDet-M, harmonized using COCO-style annotations, and systematically benchmarked 28 object detection models with diverse metrics. Introduced a CLIP-based zero-shot model selection method for adaptive deployment.

Result: FishDet-M reveals differences in detection performance across models and highlights trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. The zero-shot model selection strategy showed high semantic alignment without ensemble computation.

Conclusion: FishDet-M provides a standardized evaluation platform for underwater object detection, supporting research in ecological monitoring and intelligent marine systems.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Existing deep learning-based methods
such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Single Shot Detectors (SSDs), and
You Only Look Once (YOLO) have demonstrated high performance in terms of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores fairness in melanoma classifiers using synthetic data generated by Generative AI (LightningDiT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fairness in skin cancer screening AI systems, addressing biases tied to PII attributes (sex, age, race).

Method: Synthetic images generated using LightningDiT for evaluating publicly available melanoma classifiers.

Result: Synthetic data is promising for fairness assessment, but challenges arise with mismatched training datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can aid fairness evaluation in medical AI systems, despite challenges in dataset compatibility.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based image restoration model that balances global context and local precision for high-quality results using Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiency and quality trade-offs in image restoration tasks caused by the high computational costs of self-attention mechanisms in existing Transformers.

Method: The method combines Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) and a channel-aware module to balance global and local contexts, focusing on integrating global context into localized attention for precise pixel-level image restoration.

Result: The proposed DiNAT-IR model achieves competitive performance across multiple benchmarks in image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR effectively addresses inefficiencies in Transformer-based image restoration, providing high-quality solutions by integrating global context without compromising precision.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module for improving unsupervised domain adaptive semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) by addressing challenges in balancing local and global context, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods struggle with segmentation errors in complex regions due to ineffective balancing of local and global contextual information.

Method: The AFR module refines high-resolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits, integrates high-frequency components for enhanced boundary information, and utilizes uncertainty-driven attention for adaptive balance between local and global contexts.

Result: The proposed AFR module improves UDA-SS performance by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V to Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes benchmarks.

Conclusion: The AFR module offers a lightweight, effective enhancement for UDA-SS models, addressing segmentation challenges and achieving superior accuracy.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

TL;DR: This paper introduces the OPEN dataset for AI-driven engagement recognition in older adults' virtual learning and telehealth settings, providing over 35 hours of contextual data and achieving up to 81% recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of research and datasets for measuring engagement in older adults during virtual group learning, particularly in telehealth settings, where current methods neglect contextual relevance and longitudinal engagement patterns.

Method: The researchers collected data from weekly virtual group learning sessions involving 11 older adults over six weeks, focusing on cardiac rehabilitation. The dataset contains facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and behavioral features, while ensuring privacy protection by withholding raw video.

Result: This dataset, named OPEN, enables engagement recognition through multiple machine learning and deep learning models, which achieved up to 81% accuracy.

Conclusion: OPEN serves as a valuable resource for AI-driven personalized engagement modeling in aging populations and advances research in automated engagement recognition.

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

TL;DR: This paper presents an automated video analysis system for detecting bearded dragon behaviours using YOLO models, achieving reliable basking recognition but facing challenges with hunting detection due to weak cricket identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and error-prone nature of traditional methods in monitoring bearded dragon behaviors.

Method: Five YOLO model variants were trained on a publicly available dataset, followed by per-frame object detection, interpolation, and rule-based classification.

Result: YOLOv8s was optimal, achieving high accuracy for basking (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) but low detection rates for crickets (mAP@0.5 = 0.392), impacting hunting behavior results.

Conclusion: The automated system enhances research efficiency and data quality, but future efforts should improve cricket detection for better hunting behavior analysis.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

Motivation: Current datasets for visible-infrared person re-identification focus on ground-level perspectives, which suffer from occlusions and limited coverage. Aerial perspectives are proposed as a solution to these limitations.

Method: The paper presents AG-VPReID.VIR, a dataset collected using UAV-mounted and CCTV cameras across RGB and infrared modalities. It also introduces TCC-VPReID, a three-stream neural architecture with style-robust feature learning, cross-view adaptation, and temporal modeling.

Result: TCC-VPReID demonstrates significant performance improvements on the AG-VPReID.VIR dataset, addressing cross-viewpoint and cross-modality challenges more effectively than previous methods.

Conclusion: AG-VPReID.VIR dataset and TCC-VPReID model advance the field of 24-hour surveillance by solving aerial-ground and RGB-IR discrepancies for person re-identification.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores the impact of label bias in medical imaging datasets on AI fairness, revealing that subgroup size and separability significantly affect both learned features and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand the understudied issue of label bias affecting subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI systems.

Method: Deep learning models were trained for binary tissue density classification using the EMBED dataset, simulating label bias across different subgroup conditions, including separable subgroups and non-separable pseudo-subgroups.

Result: Label bias influenced feature representations and subgroup performance, with key dependencies on subgroup size and separability. Using biased validation labels negatively impacted performance, with true positive rates in a majority subgroup shown to drop significantly.

Conclusion: Label bias can lead to significant shifts in learned model features and performance disparities between subgroups, highlighting the need for clean labels to ensure AI fairness in medical imaging.

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimizable cost function on affine Grassmannian manifolds that explicitly derives proximity in terms of rigid body transformations for use in registration problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Affine Grassmannian is effective in measuring distances between lines and planes; however, there is no optimizable function that explicitly incorporates rigid body transformation for registration tasks.

Method: The method involves deriving a mathematical cost function based on transformed bases of high-dimensional linear subspaces, minimizing geodesic distance for globally optimal solutions.

Result: The proposed method improves convergence and performance of existing solutions in computer vision tasks, demonstrated with an inlier-set maximizing solver.

Conclusion: The approach provides a novel framework for registration problems, leveraging the theoretical precision of Grassmannian manifolds to achieve optimal solutions without representation ambiguity.

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

*Jake R. Patock,Nicole Catherine Lewis,Kevin McCoy,Christina Gomez,Canling Chen,Lorenzo Luzi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents GRR-CoCa, an improved version of the Contrastive Captioner (CoCa), which incorporates advanced architectural techniques to significantly enhance vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contemporary multimodal models lag behind large language models (LLMs) in architectural sophistication, despite their strong performance in image and text generation tasks. This paper aims to enhance the architectural design of the CoCa model for better generalization across vision-language domains.

Method: The researchers introduced architectural modifications, including Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding, into the textual decoders and vision transformer (ViT) encoder of the CoCa model. They benchmarked the modified model (GRR-CoCa) against a Baseline CoCa with similar textual decoders but retaining the original ViT encoder.

Result: GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed the Baseline CoCa across pretraining and fine-tuning tasks. Improvements included 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss during pretraining, and average fine-tuning improvements were 13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss.

Conclusion: Incorporating advanced architectural techniques from LLMs into GRR-CoCa enhances its performance and generalization in vision-language tasks, setting a new SOTA benchmark.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Celeb-DF++, a comprehensive DeepFake dataset aimed at improving generalizable forensic detection of unseen DeepFake types using a single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diverse and large-scale datasets needed to develop generalizable DeepFake detection models.

Method: The paper extends the Celeb-DF dataset by introducing Celeb-DF++, which includes videos generated using 22 different DeepFake methods across three forgery scenarios (Face-swap, Face-reenactment, and Talking-face).

Result: Celeb-DF++ demonstrates the limitations of 24 existing DeepFake detection methods when applied to diverse and unseen forgery types.

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++ provides a challenging benchmark for developing and testing generalizable detection methods that can handle the growing diversity of DeepFake videos in the real world.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting framework for reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse inpainted views, enhancing multi-view consistency and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in inpainting 3D scenes, particularly the irregularity of 3D structures and maintaining multi-view consistency, which are critical for high-quality 3D content.

Method: The proposed method uses a refined inpainting mask (via Gaussian filtering and back-projection) and an Uncertainty-guided Fine-grained Optimization strategy to identify occluded regions, restore realistic boundaries, and improve multi-view consistency.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show that the approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior visual quality and consistent multi-view reconstructions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively advances 3D scene inpainting by overcoming structural irregularities and consistency issues, offering improved quality and practicality for 3D content creation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional emotion recognition methods relying on facial or physiological data raise privacy concerns; body movement-based approaches present a promising alternative enabled by advancements in pose estimation.

Method: The survey categorizes skeletal motion-based recognition methods into posture-based and gait-based, proposes a taxonomy of four technical paradigms, and reviews benchmark comparisons.

Result: Representative research works are critically compared within the taxonomy, and benchmarking data is summarized across common datasets.

Conclusion: Skeleton-based emotion recognition holds potential for mental health applications, but challenges and future directions remain for this evolving field.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViGText, a method integrating Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) text with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to significantly improve deepfake detection in terms of robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of detecting sophisticated and customized deepfakes which evade traditional detection approaches and threaten media authenticity.

Method: ViGText divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze deepfakes, employing multi-level spatial and frequency domain feature extraction.

Result: ViGText achieves a remarkable boost in generalization with F1 scores rising to 98.32% and improves robustness with a recall increase of 11.1%, while minimizing performance degradation under targeted attacks to less than 4%.

Conclusion: ViGText provides a robust and context-aware solution for deepfake detection by integrating visual and textual analysis, setting a new standard for media authenticity assurance.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

*Hanwen Shen,Jiajie Lu,Yupeng Cao,Xiaonan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset to improve AI model performance for generating coherent multi-scene videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI video models struggle in generating multiple-scene videos with coherent transitions due to limitations in training data and inability to infer transition needs.

Method: The authors developed the TAV dataset, consisting of multi-scene video clips with preprocessed scene transitions, and used post-training to enhance models.

Result: Post-training on the TAV dataset improved the models' understanding of scene transitions and alignment with prompts while preserving video quality.

Conclusion: The TAV dataset is effective in addressing scene transition challenges in AI video generation, paving the way for better multi-scene video outputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing blur rendering methods that rely on depth estimation and suffer from artifacts at depth discontinuities.

Method: BokehDiff adapts generative diffusion models for one-step inference without additional noise, integrates a self-attention module inspired by physics, and synthesizes photorealistic paired data for training.

Result: The method successfully achieves high-quality and visually appealing lens blur effects, resolving challenges related to depth discontinuities.

Conclusion: BokehDiff advances lens blur rendering with a physically accurate approach, leveraging diffusion models and innovative data synthesis for superior visual fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLM-IMI, a framework for low-light image enhancement using vision-language models and iterative instructions, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLIE methods fail to incorporate semantic guidance from normal-light images, limiting their effectiveness under complex lighting conditions.

Method: The proposed method leverages vision-language models with text-based enhancement cues, integrating cross-modal priors through a fusion module and refining outputs with iterative instructions.

Result: Experiments confirm VLM-IMI's superiority in quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, especially under extreme low-light conditions.

Conclusion: VLM-IMI's innovative approach utilizing semantic cues and iterative refinement pushes the boundaries of LLIE performance and effectiveness.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scenethesis introduces a novel method for generating 3D software based on user requirements, improving accuracy and constraint management using a domain-specific language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of robust methods for automating 3D software generation, which is currently limited in its ability to accommodate user-specific requirements, modify elements, and handle complex spatial constraints.

Method: The authors propose 'Scenethesis,' which uses a domain-specific language (ScenethesisLang) to act as an intermediate representation for natural language requirements. It facilitates fine-grained changes, expresses spatial constraints, and breaks synthesis into adaptable stages.

Result: Scenethesis captures over 80% of user requirements, satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while effectively managing 100+ simultaneous constraints, and shows a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Scenethesis is a significant advancement in 3D software synthesis, offering formal traceability, better accuracy in requirements satisfaction, and enhanced constraint management.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TextSAM-EUS, a lightweight adaptation of SAM using text-driven prompts for pancreatic tumor segmentation in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of speckle noise, low contrast, and complex appearance in EUS images make tumor segmentation with supervised DL error-prone and reliant on extensive expert annotations.

Method: TextSAM-EUS employs BiomedCLIP-based text prompt learning and a LoRA adaptation of SAM to enable automatic segmentation, tuning only 0.86% of SAM's parameters.

Result: TextSAM-EUS achieves 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD with automatic prompts, and slightly enhanced results with manual prompts, outperforming existing SOTA DL models and foundation models.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS demonstrates the practical application of prompt learning for efficient EUS segmentation, providing an innovative approach that reduces annotation dependency and surpasses existing technologies.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSFormer, a Transformer-based approach for enhancing Visual Place Recognition, and a block clustering strategy to increase robustness and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in Visual Place Recognition (VPR), such as performance degradation under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints, which are critical for mobile robot localization.

Method: The paper proposes DSFormer, a cross-learning module utilizing bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale CNN features. It also introduces a block clustering strategy to optimize data organization, enhancing robustness and reducing training data by 30%.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets using compact 512-dimensional global descriptors, surpassing methods like DELG and R2Former while improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a robust and efficient solution for VPR that mitigates viewpoint and environmental variations, making it a valuable tool for mobile robot localization.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition methods struggle with performance degradation caused by sample heterogeneity, arising from multi-source data and individual variability in expressions.

Method: The authors propose the HDF framework, incorporating the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) for temporal and frequency modeling, and the Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) for balanced optimization between classification and contrastive tasks.

Result: Experiments on DFEW and FERV39k datasets show improved accuracy and robustness, with enhancements in weighted and unweighted average recall metrics, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The HDF framework effectively tackles challenges in DFER with its novel design, achieving higher accuracy and robustness, and proves applicable in diverse and imbalanced scenarios while codes are openly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG models struggle with limited temporal awareness and poor generalization, impacting their effectiveness in localization tasks.

Result: Experiments on various VTG benchmarks show the method consistently outperforms current models, especially in complex and open-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the role of curated datasets and tailored RL approaches to advance VTG performance, releasing resources to promote research and industrial applications.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and

cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial

*JinYoung Kim,DaeUng Jo,Kimin Yun,Jeonghyo Song,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Energy Posterior Network for better uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection by using free-energy modeling and Beta distribution techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for OoD detection fail to fully capture both data and model uncertainty, leading to inefficient alignment with the semantic objectives.

Method: Proposed a framework combining free-energy-based density estimation using Beta distribution and an uncertainty estimation loss integrated into the prediction model.

Result: Achieved fine-grained detection near ambiguous and unseen regions while providing computationally efficient segmentation validated on benchmarks like Fishyscapes and RoadAnomaly.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively identifies semantic OoD regions while improving computational efficiency and predictive uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2VWorldBench, a benchmark to evaluate text-to-video models' ability to generate semantically consistent and factually accurate videos based on world knowledge, revealing their current limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models excel at generating visually pleasing videos but struggle with semantic consistency and factual accuracy informed by world knowledge.

Method: The authors created T2VWorldBench, a systematic evaluation framework comprising 6 major categories, 60 subcategories, and 1,200 prompts, combining both human evaluations and automated evaluations using vision-language models.

Result: Evaluation of 10 advanced text-to-video models revealed that most models fall short in understanding world knowledge and generating accurate videos.

Conclusion: There is a significant gap in current text-to-video models' ability to leverage world knowledge, presenting research opportunities to improve commonsense reasoning and factual generation capabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

### [105] [Information Entropy-Based Framework for Quantifying Tortuosity in Meibomian Gland Uneven Atrophy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18135)
*Kesheng Wang,Xiaoyu Chen,Chunlei He,Fenfen Li,Xinxin Yu,Dexing Kong,Shoujun Huang,Qi Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a novel entropy-based framework for quantifying curve tortuosity, demonstrating its application in analyzing meibomian gland atrophy uniformity, particularly in Demodex-positive and negative patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise curve tortuosity quantification is crucial for diagnosing and assessing diseases, yet existing methods relying on simplistic measures often fall short in medical applications.

Method: The framework integrates probability modeling, entropy theory, and curve data domain transformation, using a biologically plausible reference curve for robust evaluation, unlike traditional approaches based on straight-line comparisons.

Result: Through numerical simulations and patient data analysis, the framework effectively distinguished Demodex-negative from positive groups, achieving an AUC of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of 0.93.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates strong clinical utility in curve tortuosity analysis and can serve as a general tool for medical morphological evaluations.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

*Jinhong He,Minglong Xue,Zhipu Liu,Mingliang Zhou,Aoxiang Ning,Palaiahnakote Shivakumara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bidirectional diffusion mechanism for low-light image enhancement to better align with real-world degradation patterns and improve visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of unidirectional modeling in diffusion-based methods, which struggle with structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments in low-light image enhancement.

Method: Introduce a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism with paths for low-to-normal and normal-to-low light modeling. Incorporate an Adaptive Feature Interaction block (AFI) to refine features and a Reflection-Aware Correction Module (RACM) for post-denoising restoration.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations and generalizes well to various degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: Bidirectional diffusion and introduced modules improve illumination and detail restoration, providing consistent degradation learning and producing high-quality images that align with human visual perception.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance object detection by leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery, while addressing information loss and inefficient feature fusion in previous approaches.

Method: The method proposes WaveMamba, which combines RGB and IR image features through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). It introduces the WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB) for frequency-specific fusion and an enhanced detection head using the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT).

Result: WaveMamba demonstrates significant performance improvements, showing a 4.5% higher average mAP compared to state-of-the-art methods across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: WaveMamba showcases efficient and comprehensive RGB-IR feature integration using DWT and IDWT, establishing a new benchmark for object detection performance on RGB-IR datasets.

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

*Abhishek Kaushik,Norbert Haala,Uwe Soergel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage framework for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation to address domain shifts, without requiring manual annotations in the target domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation caused by domain shifts, such as differences in sensor type and geographical location, while avoiding the prohibitive manual annotation of target datasets.

Method: The approach involves two stages: 1) Unsupervised contrastive learning is used to pre-train a backbone network to learn domain-invariant features. 2) An ensemble of state-of-the-art architectures generates pseudo-labels via hard voting, which are then used for fine-tuning the pre-trained network.

Result: Experiments show significant enhancement in segmentation accuracy on datasets like SemanticPOSS and SemanticSlamantic when adapting from SemanticKITTI, outperforming direct transfer and single-model UDA techniques.

Conclusion: Combining contrastive pre-training with robust pseudo-labeling effectively mitigates domain shifts in 3D LiDAR segmentation, offering a potent methodology without the need for target domain annotations.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba, combining UNet and mamba mechanisms, improves segmentation accuracy in medical imaging, especially in data-scarce situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models often struggle in data-scarce scenarios, particularly for medical image segmentation, due to overfitting to noise and irrelevant patterns.

Method: The proposed Diff-UMamba architecture integrates a UNet framework and long-range dependency modeling via mamba mechanism. A Noise Reduction Module (NRM) within the encoder filters out noisy or irrelevant activations.

Result: Diff-UMamba outperforms baseline methods by 1-3% across multiple public datasets and achieves a 4-5% improvement on an internal NSCLC dataset under limited-data settings.

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba effectively addresses generalization issues in low-data medical image segmentation by leveraging noise reduction strategies and long-range dependency modeling, offering improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Phan Nguyen Duc Hieu,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL is a self-supervised learning architecture for analyzing metallic material micrographs, using Gated Feature Fusion to effectively integrate multi-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for micrograph analysis of metallic materials are overly reliant on supervised learning, requiring retraining for every new dataset and struggling when labeled samples are limited. Even self-supervised methods often need large-scale datasets, which may not be feasible.

Method: The proposed MatSSL architecture incorporates self-supervised pretraining on a small unlabeled micrograph dataset. It employs Gated Feature Fusion within the backbone to merge multi-level representations and is then fine-tuned on benchmark datasets for segmentation tasks.

Result: MatSSL achieves a 69.13% mIoU on the MetalDAM dataset, surpassing an ImageNet-pretrained encoder's 66.73% mIoU. It also demonstrates up to a 40% improvement in mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark compared to MicroNet-pretrained models.

Conclusion: MatSSL is effective for adapting to the metallographic domain using limited unlabeled data, producing results competitive with those needing large-scale pretraining while maintaining transferable feature extraction capabilities.

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

TL;DR: TeEFusion presents an efficient distillation method to optimize text-to-image synthesis, reducing inference costs and achieving up to 6x faster speeds while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high inference costs caused by classifier-free guidance (CFG) and complex sampling algorithms in text-to-image synthesis.

Method: TeEFusion fuses conditional and unconditional text embeddings through linear operations, incorporating guidance magnitude directly into text embeddings and distilling the teacher model's sampling strategy.

Result: The student model mimics the teacher's performance closely with a simplified sampling strategy, achieving up to 6x faster inference speeds without compromising image quality.

Conclusion: TeEFusion effectively reduces computational costs in text-to-image synthesis, maintaining performance comparable to complex methods, with publicly available code enabling further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

*Qilin Huang,Tianyu Lin,Zhiguang Chen,Fudan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF introduces a fine-tuning method for latent diffusion models tailored for medical image segmentation, achieving better performance without architectural modifications or increased computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional adoption of diffusion models for medical image segmentation lacks targeted optimization and shows deficiencies in feature extraction.

Method: LEAF modifies the noise prediction approach to directly predict segmentation maps and employs feature distillation to align convolutional layer states with transformer-based features.

Result: Experimental evaluations show LEAF improves segmentation results across various datasets without expanding model architecture or inference overhead.

Conclusion: LEAF is an efficient and effective approach tailored for medical image segmentation using latent diffusion models.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

*Xin Wei,Qin Yang,Yijie Fang,Mingrui Zhu,Nannan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSDTTA, an efficient 3D point cloud classification adaptation method using graph spectral domain techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point clouds pose challenges for test-time adaptation due to their irregular and unordered structure, and current methods involve computationally expensive techniques and additional training data.

Method: The authors propose GSDTTA, which uses Graph Fourier Transform to represent point clouds in the spectral domain, optimizing only low-frequency components for adaptation, followed by inverse transformation and iterative self-training refinement.

Result: Experimental results indicate that GSDTTA surpasses existing 3D point cloud TTA techniques in effectiveness, as validated on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GSDTTA offers an efficient and effective solution for 3D point cloud classification under domain shifts, leveraging spectral domain properties for adaptation.

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,

*Chengchang Tian,Jianwei Ma,Yan Huang,Zhanye Chen,Honghao Wei,Hui Zhang,Wei Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network to overcome domain gaps and temporal misalignments in collaborative perception using novel alignment and feature aggregation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of domain gaps caused by hardware diversity and deployment conditions, as well as temporal misalignment due to transmission delays, which cumulatively degrade feature quality in collaborative perception.

Method: The researchers developed the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network. It features three key components: 1) a Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) for reducing domain gaps, 2) a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module (PTAM) for managing transmission delays, and 3) an Instance-focused Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) for improving semantic representations.

Result: DATA delivers state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets and maintains robustness even in scenarios with severe communication delays and pose errors.

Conclusion: The DATA network systematically aligns features across domains and time, improving collaborative perception's effectiveness, with its code being made available for wider use.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

*Longjian Zeng,Zunjie Zhu,Rongfeng Lu,Ming Lu,Bolun Zheng,Chenggang Yan,Anke Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DepthDark, a foundation model for monocular depth estimation in low-light scenarios, addressing the limitations of existing models in such conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of robust monocular depth estimation models designed for low-light scenarios due to the absence of large-scale datasets and effective fine-tuning strategies.

Method: DepthDark includes a flare-simulation and noise-simulation module to create accurate synthetic low-light datasets, along with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy guided by illumination and multiscale feature fusion.

Result: DepthDark achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets while requiring limited data and computational resources.

Conclusion: DepthDark is effective in improving depth estimation under low-light conditions, providing a robust solution to the challenges in this domain.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

*Zhuoguang Chen,Minghui Qin,Tianyuan Yuan,Zhe Liu,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LONG3R is a model for streaming multi-view 3D scene reconstruction over long image sequences in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view scene reconstruction methods struggle with real-time processing for long image sequences due to offline optimization or sequence length limits.

Method: LONG3R introduces a recurrent framework with memory gating, a dual-source refined decoder, and 3D spatio-temporal memory for coarse-to-fine scene reconstruction. A two-stage curriculum training strategy is used for efficiency.

Result: LONG3R surpasses existing streaming methods, excelling in long sequence handling while maintaining real-time speeds.

Conclusion: LONG3R addresses the limitations of current methods, offering a scalable and efficient solution for streaming 3D scene reconstruction in real-time.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

*Junyao Li,Yahao Lu,Xingyuan Guo,Xiaoyu Xian,Tiantian Wang,Yukai Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper aims to improve infrared small target detection (ISTD) under conditions of data scarcity and real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance issues that current ISTD methods face due to reliance on large, manually labeled datasets and their fragility in real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduced Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning, including Gaussian Group Squeezer for non-uniform quantization and two-stage diffusion models for real-world data reconstruction.

Result: The proposed method showed enhanced resilience and better synthetic sample quality in ISTD under data scarcity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach improves ISTD performance by enabling better adaptation to real-world challenges and scarce high-quality data environments.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

*Wenran Zhang,Huihuan Luo,Linda Wei,Ping Nie,Yiqun Wu,Dedong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores the causal relationship between dental traits (dental caries, periodontitis) and lung cancer, finding that dental caries increase lung cancer risk, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, partially mediated by reduced lung function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether there is a causal relationship between oral diseases like periodontitis and dental caries and lung cancer, as observational studies suggest potential links but causality remains unclear.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used on genetic data from large genome-wide association studies to examine links between dental traits and lung cancer subtypes, assessing lung function as a mediator using the delta method.

Result: The study found a significant positive causal effect of dental caries on lung cancer risk, especially squamous cell carcinoma, with mediated effects through reduced lung function (FVC, FEV1). There was no causal link identified for periodontitis.

Conclusion: The findings indicate a causal relationship between dental caries and lung cancer, emphasizing the importance of dental care and monitoring pulmonary function for integrated cancer prevention strategies.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

### [119] [LMM-Det: Make Large Multimodal Models Excel in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18300)
*Jincheng Li,Chunyu Xie,Ji Ao,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMM-Det, a novel method that leverages large multimodal models for effective object detection without requiring specialized modules. It demonstrates improved recall rates and detection performance through data distribution adjustment and inference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection using large multimodal models (LMMs) lags behind specialized detectors. The paper aims to address this gap by exploring LMMs' potential for standalone object detection without relying on external modules.

Method: The authors perform exploratory analysis to understand the limitations of LMM-based object detection. They enhance detection capabilities by re-structuring the instruction conversations and optimizing data distribution and inference processes.

Result: Experiments confirm that LMM-Det significantly improves recall rates and detection performance compared to baseline methods, validating its standalone capability without extra modules.

Conclusion: LMM-Det successfully repurposes large multimodal models for accurate object detection, demonstrating their versatility in tackling these tasks without relying on heavyweight detection-specific modules.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are
available at https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det.

*Xiaomei Zhang,Hanyu Zheng,Xiangyu Zhu,Jinghuan Wei,Junhong Zou,Zhen Lei,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FieldLVLM, a new framework to enhance large vision-language models (LVLMs) for interpreting scientific field data, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs, despite their success in general tasks like image captioning, struggle with scientific domain applications like interpreting complex field data used in natural sciences.

Method: FieldLVLM includes a field-aware language generation strategy to extract specific scientific features (e.g., flow classification) and convert them into structured texts, combined with data-compressed multimodal tuning to simplify and optimize the input data for LVLMs training.

Result: FieldLVLM outperformed existing approaches on newly created benchmark tasks involving the interpretation of scientific field data.

Conclusion: FieldLVLM can enhance the applicability of LVLMs in scientific discovery, making them more attuned to specialized domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study benchmarks semi-supervised methods for ECG delineation, demonstrating that transformers outperform convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG delineation is important for clinical diagnosis but hindered by a lack of labeled datasets. Semi-supervised learning is a potential solution.

Method: A systematic evaluation of five SemiSeg algorithms, implemented on convolutional and transformer architectures, across in-domain and cross-domain settings. ECG-specific training and augmentation strategies were introduced.

Result: Transformers showed superior performance over convolutional networks in semi-supervised ECG delineation.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides a foundation to advance semi-supervised ECG delineation, enabling better research and development in the field.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Modified Nuclear Norm (MNN) framework for matrix recovery tasks, providing theoretical guarantees and addressing local and global information jointly without parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing matrix recovery methods either focus only on global low-rank properties or combine global and local information without guarantees for theoretical recovery performance.

Method: The paper proposes the MNN framework, which applies transformations to input matrices before computing the Nuclear Norm (NN), capturing both local and global structure and offering recovery guarantees under certain conditions.

Result: The MNN framework demonstrated superior performance in matrix recovery tasks like Robust PCA and matrix completion, supported by both theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.

Conclusion: MNN provides a unified and effective approach to structured low-rank recovery, presenting advantages in flexibility, theoretical rigor, and practical impact compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Franck Ballerini,Stephania-Denisa Bocu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS) dataset and a unified deep learning model for analyzing contrails' climate impact, with the aim of improving model accuracy and climate assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrails significantly contribute to aviation's climate impact, yet current datasets and models inadequately capture their dynamics, formation, and lifecycle.

Method: The authors developed a new dataset (GVCCS) of contrail videos and proposed a panoptic segmentation deep learning framework for contrail analysis, combining semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and temporal tracking.

Result: The GVCCS dataset spans 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) with detailed temporal annotations and flight identifiers for contrails. The proposed deep learning model provides high-quality contrail analysis.

Conclusion: The dataset and model improve contrail tracking, analysis, and physical model calibration, enabling better understanding of aviation's climate impact and advancing climate mitigation research.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGCDet, a novel 3D object detection framework enhancing voxel representation through adaptive volume construction, showing state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve indoor 3D object detection by addressing limitations of fixed receptive fields and computational inefficiencies in traditional methods.

Method: They propose a geometry and context-aware module for adaptive voxel aggregation, alongside a sparse volume construction strategy to reduce redundant computation and enhance feature representation.

Result: SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ARKitScenes, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: SGCDet provides an adaptive and efficient approach to indoor 3D object detection and can work with 3D bounding box supervision alone, showing significant improvements in performance and representation.

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper enhances bird species classification using colored spectrograms to represent motifs, showing significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in classifying bird species via audio recordings, particularly in low-SNR and multi-species conditions.

Method: Frequency information is embedded into spectrograms by adding primary color components to better distinguish between bird species.

Result: The proposed approach improves classification accuracy, surpassing prior benchmarks such as the BirdCLEF 2024 winner.

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency-based colorization significantly boosts bird species classification performance, validating the authors' hypothesis.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EgoExoBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate AI systems on egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human intelligence naturally integrates egocentric and exocentric perspectives for learning and knowledge sharing, yet current multimodal language models lack mechanisms for such reasoning.

Method: EgoExoBench consists of over 7,300 question-answer pairs grouped into eleven tasks under three main challenges: semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. The performance of 13 state-of-the-art models was assessed with this benchmark.

Result: The evaluated models performed well on tasks involving single-view reasoning, but struggled significantly with cross-view (egocentric-exocentric) challenges such as semantic alignment, perspective association, and temporal inference.

Conclusion: EgoExoBench provides a novel and valuable framework for advancing research in AI systems aiming to achieve human-like reasoning across different viewpoints.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional and existing deformable convolutions in handling global, complex, and self-similar structures like fundus blood vessels.

Method: A deformable convolutional module using attention and feedforward networks is introduced to learn sub-pixel displacement fields and warp feature maps, decoupling kernel size from the learning network.

Result: The proposed GDCUnet outperformed others in fundus blood vessel segmentation with improved feature learning, representation, and generalization.

Conclusion: The deformable module is effective for complex global pattern detection and can be applied to other machine vision tasks with similar characteristics.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

*Xiaotian Chen,DongFu Yin,Fei Richard Yu,Xuanchen Li,Xinhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVG4D introduces a novel method combining multi-view synthesis and 4D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-quality dynamic 4D content from a single image, addressing challenges in previous methods such as motion discontinuity and background degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges in creating high-fidelity, temporally consistent 4D digital content for AR/VR applications.

Method: MVG4D uses an image matrix module for synthesizing multi-view images that guide 3D and 4D reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting, coupled with a lightweight deformation network for temporal consistency.

Result: MVG4D outperformed existing methods across benchmarks like CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and time efficiency, reducing flickering artifacts and enhancing structural detail.

Conclusion: MVG4D demonstrates improved temporal and visual realism in 4D generation, paving the way for immersive and efficient AR/VR content creation.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

### [131] [Towards Consistent Long-Term Pose Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18382)
*Yayuan Li,Filippos Bellos,Jason Corso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses pose generation limitations by introducing a one-stage architecture that directly generates poses using RGB images and text descriptions, outperforming existing methods in generating long-term, temporally coherent poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current pose generation methods that rely on intermediate representations or accumulate errors, especially in maintaining long-term temporal coherence.

Method: The paper proposes a one-stage architecture that uses relative movement prediction in continuous coordinate space, removing intermediate representations, and incorporates a unified placeholder token approach for consistent training and inference.

Result: Experiments on Penn Action and F-PHAB datasets show that this approach significantly improves long-term pose generation performance compared to quantization-based and autoregressive methods.

Conclusion: The novel one-stage approach enables efficient, coherent pose generation, demonstrating its superiority over traditional methods in terms of accuracy and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

*Yu Jiang,Jiahao Xia,Jiongming Qin,Yusen Wang,Tuo Cao,Chunxia Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved approach to full-body human inverse rendering by constructing a high-quality material dataset and designing a progressive training model for material estimation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in achieving photo-realistic rendering of human materials due to the absence of proper constraints in inverse rendering and the limitations of previous datasets and methods.

Method: A high-quality material dataset (OpenHumanBRDF) was developed, incorporating advanced material data like displacement and subsurface scattering. A model called HumanMaterial was designed with a progressive training strategy, including prior models and a Controlled PBR Rendering (CPR) loss to enhance material estimation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real-world data, improving the realism and accuracy of material estimation and rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and progressive training approach significantly improve the quality and realism of human material rendering, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Overcoming Swin Transformer's limitation of requiring two blocks for global attention and enhancing hierarchical vision transformers' flexibility for various resolutions.

Method: Uses interleaved window attention for distant token connection and depthwise separable convolution for neighboring token linkage, combining global and local information within one module.

Result: Achieved top-tier performance in multiple visual benchmarks, including 87.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, and validated the standalone efficacy of its components in class-conditional image generation.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer provides a high-performance alternative in vision tasks, introduces innovative techniques, and has potential influence on future research directions in image and video generation.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFFSNet is a novel medical image segmentation framework that outperforms existing methods in precision and usability by introducing a feature decoupling strategy for better connectivity and edge handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving edge precision and regional consistency in medical segmentation while addressing the lack of mechanisms to balance feature strengths in existing methods.

Method: Introducing DCFFSNet with a feature decoupling strategy and a dynamic dual-connectivity fusion-separation architecture to balance and quantify multi-scale features.

Result: DCFFSNet outperformed state-of-the-art models (CMUNet, TransUNet, CSCAUNet) on ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets in Dice and IoU metrics.

Conclusion: DCFFSNet provides better clinical usability, resolving segmentation fragmentation and ensuring smoother edge transitions, surpassing existing segmentation techniques.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the application of the V-JEPA self-supervised learning framework for ultrasound video data and enhances its performance with a novel 3D localization auxiliary task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acquiring annotated datasets for ultrasound imaging is difficult due to low image quality and the requirement for clinical expertise, prompting the need for self-supervised learning techniques to work effectively with limited labeled data.

Method: The authors adopt the V-JEPA framework, which uses feature prediction instead of pixel-level reconstruction, and incorporate a 3D localization auxiliary task to improve locality during pre-training on ViT models.

Result: The proposed approach improves segmentation performance significantly, with performance gains of up to 3.4% using all training data and up to 8.35% using only 10% of the data.

Conclusion: The novel combination of V-JEPA and the 3D localization task enhances ultrasound segmentation performance, making it a promising solution for scenarios with limited annotated data.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

*Mahdi Ghafourian,Federico M. Sukno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NLML-HPE, a head pose estimation method based on non-linear manifold learning and tensor decomposition, to efficiently predict poses with limited training data while addressing issues with annotation accuracy and achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance head pose estimation (HPE) in scenarios with limited training data, by overcoming inaccuracies in pose annotation and improving real-time prediction performance.

Method: The proposed method combines tensor decomposition (Tucker decomposition) and feedforward neural networks to formulate HPE as a regression problem, representing pose angles (yaw, pitch, roll) in separate subspaces modeled as cosine curves. A precise 2D dataset was created by rotating 3D head models for training.

Result: The method achieves accurate pose estimation even with limited and consistent training data, demonstrating real-time performance by efficiently learning the rotational characteristics of head poses.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE provides a robust and efficient approach for head pose estimation, addressing dataset annotation issues and maximizing performance in real-world settings with constrained data availability.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB-Eval, a benchmark for understanding personalized driver behavior and aligning large multimodal models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension, showcasing improved performance in zero-shot tasks and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve risk assessment, accident prevention, and driver assistance systems by enhancing understanding of individual driver behaviors, especially using external evidence, and addressing limitations in current datasets.

Method: The authors developed PDB-Eval, which includes PDB-X (for temporal scene understanding) and PDB-QA (a visual question-answering task for aligning MLLMs' reasoning skills). They fine-tuned MLLMs with these components to bridge domain gaps.

Result: Fine-tuning on PDB-QA improved zero-shot performance on QA tasks by 73.2%. Additionally, MLLMs fine-tuned with PDB-X showed up to 12.5% improvement in turn intention prediction in Brain4Cars and up to 11.0% improvement in AIDE tasks.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that fine-tuning MLLMs with PDB-Eval enhances their driving domain alignment, improving comprehension, reasoning, and practical application performance.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a standardized, device-agnostic framework for physical adversarial object attacks in LiDAR, validated through simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in reproducibility and limited exploration of physical adversarial attacks in LiDAR-based 3D object detection systems.

Method: The authors propose a device-agnostic framework that supports diverse attack methods, benchmarks protocols, and provides open-source code for reproducibility across simulation and physical scenarios.

Result: The framework successfully transfers simulated attacks to physical LiDAR systems and provides insights into factors affecting attack success.

Conclusion: The framework advances research in adversarial robustness for real-world LiDAR perception and facilitates fair comparison across methods.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

*Si-Woo Kim,MinJu Jeon,Ye-Chan Kim,Soeun Lee,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynC is a method to improve Zero-shot Image Captioning by refining synthetic image-caption datasets using a reassignment strategy instead of filtering or regenerating data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic datasets generated by text-to-image models often suffer from semantic misalignments between images and captions, leading to noisy data that hinders model training.

Method: SynC employs a one-to-many mapping strategy to reassign captions to semantically aligned images. It retrieves candidate images for each caption and selects the best match using a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer.

Result: SynC significantly improves Zero-shot Image Captioning performance on benchmarks such as MS-COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps, achieving state-of-the-art results in several cases.

Conclusion: SynC effectively curates synthetic datasets, enhancing the quality of data for Zero-shot Image Captioning and advancing model performance on industry-standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRUISE, a novel framework for reconstructing and augmenting V2X scenarios, enhancing autonomous driving by boosting data generation, training, and performance evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is vital for autonomous driving, yet data generation and augmentation for V2X is underexplored. The paper aims to fill this gap by enabling better simulation and dataset enhancement.

Method: The proposed CRUISE framework uses decomposed Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct real-world V2X scenes and represents dynamic traffic participants as editable Gaussian models. This allows for scene modification, augmentation, and rendering of multi-perspective images.

Result: Experimental results show that CRUISE achieves high-fidelity scene reconstructions, improves 3D detection and cooperative tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark, and generates challenging edge cases for testing systems.

Conclusion: CRUISE enhances V2X dataset generation and augmentation, ultimately advancing the training and evaluation processes in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of medical anomaly detection arising from the diversity of anomalies and lack of comprehensive annotated datasets.

Method: The method involves using frozen vision foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and Masked Autoencoder) as feature extractors, integrating the Q-Former as a bottleneck for controlling reconstruction sequence length, and introducing perceptual loss for guiding semantic structure-based reconstructions.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on medical anomaly detection benchmarks such as BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of pretrained vision models on natural images to generalize well to medical anomaly detection tasks, providing an effective unsupervised framework with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

TL;DR: This paper presents enhanced annotations for the NIH malaria dataset to improve automated malaria diagnosis utilizing deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance reliable malaria diagnosis in developing countries by addressing the lack of detailed instance-level annotations in existing malaria datasets and supporting automated detection.

Method: The authors improved the NIH malaria dataset by providing bounding box annotations in COCO format, validated using a Faster R-CNN model.

Result: The proposed method achieved F1 scores of up to 0.88 for detecting infected red blood cells in cross-validation tests, emphasizing the importance of high-quality annotation.

Conclusion: The enhanced dataset significantly improves object detection for malaria diagnosis, and the annotations are publicly available to advance further research.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

*Xiao Yang,Lingxuan Wu,Lizhong Wang,Chengyang Ying,Hang Su,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses adversarial threats in 3D environments by proposing Rein-EAD, a proactive defense framework optimizing perception robustness, validated through diverse real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defense mechanisms in 3D adversarial contexts are limited due to pre-defined assumptions, making them ineffective in dynamic and complex environments. The study aims to develop a more adaptable and proactive approach.

Method: The paper proposes Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), which utilizes adaptive exploration and a multi-step objective framework. This includes predictive entropy minimization and an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism for optimal defense strategy learning.

Result: Experiments show that Rein-EAD significantly reduces attack success rates while preserving prediction accuracy. It generalizes well to unseen and adaptive attacks across various applications.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD is effective in improving robustness against 3D adversarial threats, providing a practical and generalizable solution suitable for real-world tasks like 3D object classification, face recognition, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines how map uncertainty affects trajectory prediction in mapless autonomous driving, introducing adaptive techniques to improve performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of online-generated HD maps in mapless autonomous driving and explore how map uncertainty benefits trajectory prediction.

Method: The study analyzes the scenarios where map uncertainty impacts trajectory prediction, proposes Proprioceptive Scenario Gating based on ego-vehicle kinematics, and introduces a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach.

Result: The proposed methods achieved a 23.6% improvement over state-of-the-art in mapless trajectory prediction using the real-world nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating adaptive map uncertainty based on the ego-vehicle's kinematics significantly improves trajectory prediction performance and interpretability. The proposed methods are lightweight and self-supervised.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our
code, data, and models are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SemBA-FAST, a framework for human-like visual attention modelling, leveraging deep learning and semantic foveal mechanisms to predict scanpaths effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human visual attention in goal-directed tasks is influenced by multiple cues, and leveraging foveal information in models can enhance attention prediction, addressing a gap in computational frameworks.

Method: SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a semantic probabilistic fusion mechanism, relying on pre-trained detectors and artificial foveation to dynamically generate and update attention maps for sequential fixation predictions.

Result: The model was tested on the COCO-Search18 dataset, achieving scanpaths closely matching human data, outperforming baseline and top-down models, and competing with scanpath-informed counterparts.

Conclusion: SemBA-FAST demonstrates the potential of semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks in accurately modeling human attention, with applications in cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications
for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

*Clément Cornet,Romaric Besançon,Hervé Le Borgne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces tools to compare features of different encoder models using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and evaluates their shared representations. It provides insights into how multimodal and single-mode encoders share features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the gap in analyzing and quantitatively comparing features derived from Sparse Autoencoders across different encoder models (e.g., visual, textual, multimodal), previously limited to single modality studies.

Method: The authors propose two tools: an indicator for quantitative model comparison across SAE features and a measure for assessing the Comparative Sharedness of features across model types. These are applied to 21 encoders of different types using general and domain-specific datasets.

Result: The results reveal the extent of shared features among encoder models, show that multimodal context alters previous analyses, and establish that some vision-specific features in multimodal encoders overlap with features in text encoders.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that text pretraining significantly influences feature sharing across encoder types and provides new tools for cross-modality comparison, offering a fresh perspective on encoder model representation learning.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses detecting rare objects, specifically bio-digesters, in remote sensing imagery and estimates their methane emissions in France.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing availability of remote sensing data enables environmental applications, but detecting rare objects like bio-digesters, crucial to methane emissions estimation, poses challenges due to data imbalance.

Method: The authors present a novel part-based detection method using essential bio-digester sub-elements and apply it to an imbalanced dataset with a larger test set lacking objects to improve detection stability in unseen regions.

Result: The proposed method was successfully applied to detect bio-digesters in new geographic regions, enabling creation of an inventory of such sites and estimating methane emissions.

Conclusion: This study provides an efficient detection method for rare objects and supports environmental monitoring by generating geostatistical insights, improving large-scale methane production assessments.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of achieving semantic object segmentation in highly cluttered or 'in the wild' scenarios, particularly for applications like vision-guided upper limb neuroprostheses.

Method: Develop a use-case-specific prompt generation technique using gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and fine-tune it with egocentric visual data for segmentation tasks.

Result: Achieved significant improvements in IoU segmentation quality metric (up to 0.51 points) on real-world data from the Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus.

Conclusion: Gaze fixation-guided prompting and tailored fine-tuning of SAM enhance its effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios, demonstrating potential for specialized object-segmentation applications.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data
of Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus which is made available on the RoboFlow Platform

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GaussianFusionOcc, a 3D semantic occupancy predictor for autonomous driving, combining camera, LiDAR, and radar via an efficient Gaussian-based representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide more precise and safe navigation capabilities in autonomous driving by developing a memory-efficient and scalable 3D semantic occupancy prediction method.

Method: The method uses semantic 3D Gaussians and a sensor fusion mechanism with modality-agnostic deformable attention to integrate data from camera, LiDAR, and radar sensors.

Result: Extensive testing shows GaussianFusionOcc outperforms state-of-the-art models, proving its versatility and effectiveness in combining sensor modalities.

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc improves predictive accuracy, efficiency, and scalability for autonomous navigation, setting a new benchmark in multi-modal sensor fusion-based 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces IntentVCNet, a model designed to improve fine-grained intent-oriented video captioning by unifying spatial and temporal understanding in large visual language models (LVLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LVLMs' proficiency in spatial and temporal comprehension, they struggle with fine-grained spatio-temporal control for intent-based video captioning.

Method: The approach combines a prompt strategy for user intent modeling and a 'parameter-efficient box adapter' for enhancing object semantics in the global visual context.

Result: IntentVCNet achieves superior performance in spatial modeling of videos, securing state-of-the-art performance in several LVLM benchmarks and placing runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

Conclusion: The unified strategy of prompt combination and spatial enhancement improves LVLMs' ability to generate accurate intent-oriented video captions.

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

TL;DR: This paper presents EDA, an improvement over traditional diffusion models, introducing arbitrary noise patterns to better address image restoration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of fixed Gaussian noise in diffusion models, which increase complexity and hinder image restoration performance.

Method: EDA expands the noise pattern flexibility in diffusion models without added computational burden, allowing for the inclusion of diverse noise types.

Result: EDA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three tasks: MRI bias field correction, CT metal artifact reduction, and shadow removal, using only 5 sampling steps.

Conclusion: EDA successfully broadens the design space of diffusion models for arbitrary noise patterns, demonstrating significant improvements in image restoration across multiple tasks.

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TTS-VAR, a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models that improves generation performance by balancing computational efficiency and exploration using adaptive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling has gained attention as a resource-efficient alternative to expensive training and computational methods for scaling content-creation models.

Method: The method involves modeling the generation process as a path searching problem, with an adaptive descending batch size schedule. It also incorporates clustering-based diversity search at coarse scales for structural variety and resampling-based potential selection at fine scales for prioritizing promising candidates.

Result: The framework demonstrates an 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75) using the Infinity VAR model.

Conclusion: Early-stage structural features are critical for final quality, and the framework effectively improves visual generation efficiency and performance with scalable test-time adjustments.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for unposed 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction by integrating Multi-View Stereo priors and probabilistic Procrustes mapping to overcome challenges in scaling to hundreds of outdoor images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques struggle with unposed reconstruction from large-scale, unposed outdoor image datasets due to memory limits and declining accuracy of current Multi-View Stereo models.

Method: The method partitions input subsets of images, aligns global spaces using a probabilistic Procrustes mapping strategy, handles correspondence uncertainties with a soft dustbin mechanism, and refines reconstructions using a joint optimization framework with confidence-aware anchor points and an analytical Jacobian.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated accurate reconstruction and pose estimation for unposed image sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Waymo and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: This framework sets a new standard for unposed 3D Gaussian Splatting by robustly handling unposed outdoor datasets and achieving precise reconstruction and pose alignment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

*Daniil Morozov,Reuben Dorent,Nazim Haouchine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for aligning real-time intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI, achieving better precision in feature matching and robust image registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of aligning intraoperative ultrasound with preoperative MRI is challenging due to differences in imaging modalities, such as appearance and field-of-view. The goal is to improve registration methods for better integration of these imaging techniques.

Method: The paper uses synthetic generation of ultrasound images from MRI to perform patient-specific training of a cross-modal descriptor. A contrastive learning approach combined with a curriculum-based loss helped to create robust descriptors. These descriptors are used for probabilistic salient point detection and matching across modalities, leading to rigid image registration.

Result: The approach was tested on the ReMIND dataset, achieving an average precision of 69.8% in keypoint matching and a mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm for MRI-iUS registration. It outperformed existing methods.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates better interpretability, does not require manual initialization, and is robust to field-of-view variations in iUS, presenting a meaningful advancement in MRI-iUS registration.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

TL;DR: VideoMind is a novel omni-modal video dataset with 103K video samples, focusing on deep video content cognition and fine-grained cross-modal alignment through hierarchical textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for datasets enabling deep video understanding, including detailed intent expressions and multi-modal feature representation.

Method: Hierarchical textual descriptions (factual, abstract, intent) were generated for video and audio using Chain-of-Thought reasoning. The dataset includes annotations for various attributes and a benchmark of 3,000 manually validated samples for evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of models like InternVideo, VAST, and UMT-L on the VideoMind dataset was conducted, highlighting its utility for advanced video tasks such as intent recognition.

Conclusion: VideoMind is a publicly available dataset designed as a benchmark for cross-modal alignment and in-depth video comprehension tasks, contributing significantly to fields like emotion and intent recognition.

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

*Yihong Feng,Chaitanya Pallerla,Xiaomin Lin,Pouya Sohrabipour Sr,Philip Crandall,Wan Shou,Yu She,Dongyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces synthetic and annotated datasets for improving chicken carcass instance segmentation and demonstrates performance gains using synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the scarcity of annotated datasets for automated instance segmentation of chicken carcasses in poultry processing lines, which is crucial for efficiency and quality.

Method: It introduces a pipeline to generate photo-realistic synthetic images with automatic annotations and evaluates models with varying mixes of synthetic and real data.

Result: Synthetic data significantly improved segmentation performance across all tested instance segmentation models.

Conclusion: The work emphasizes synthetic data augmentation as an effective approach to address data scarcity and reduce manual annotation efforts for poultry industry AI applications.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

*Muhammad Imran Zaman,Nisar Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes a new CNN model for simultaneous age and gender classification using facial images, achieving high accuracy and identifying areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance targeted advertising by improving age and gender classification from facial images.

Method: They propose a custom CNN architecture that leverages shared representations of age and gender, using a robust pre-processed dataset of facial images.

Result: The model achieves 95% accuracy in gender classification and a mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation, with noted challenges for younger age groups.

Conclusion: The study identifies areas for improvement like data augmentation for younger individuals and provides insights into CNN design and hyperparameter tuning for future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

### [159] [Facial Demorphing from a Single Morph Using a Latent Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18566)
*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for demorphing face images, which overcomes existing limitations such as morph replication and dependency on known morph techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of existing demorphing methods, which fail to produce accurate constituent images or rely on prior knowledge of morphing techniques.

Method: The method decomposes a morph in latent space and is trained on synthetic faces, allowing it to process morphs created from real faces with unknown techniques.

Result: The proposed method outperformed existing demorphing techniques and generated high-fidelity constituent face images.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates effectiveness in demorphing morphs made from unseen face styles and techniques, providing additional evidence against morph attack detection.

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

### [160] [Adversarial Distribution Matching for Diffusion Distillation Towards Efficient Image and Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18569)
*Yanzuo Lu,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Shanchuan Lin,Xing Wang,Xuefeng Xiao,Andy J. Ma,Xiaohua Xie,Jian-Huang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM) for distilling teacher diffusion models, addressing mode-seeking issues in existing methods, and achieves superior efficiency and performance for image and video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the mode collapse problem in Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), which relies on reverse KL divergence minimization, and improve the efficiency and performance of score distillation methods.

Method: The authors propose ADM, which uses diffusion-based discriminators to align latent predictions adversarially. They improve the pre-training generator through hybrid discriminators in latent and pixel spaces, incorporate a distributional loss from ODE pairs for better initialization, and combine these methods into a unified pipeline called DMDX.

Result: The proposed DMDX achieves improved one-step distillation performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 with reduced GPU usage. It also sets new benchmarks for multi-step distillation in image and video synthesis on datasets like SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX.

Conclusion: ADM effectively addresses limitations in current score distillation techniques, achieving both better performance and computational efficiency, and represents a significant step towards practical applications in image and video synthesis.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

*Xinyu Wang,Jinghua Hou,Zhe Liu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HybridTM, integrating Transformer and Mamba architectures for 3D semantic segmentation, addressing both long-range dependencies and fine-grained features effectively while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of Transformer’s quadratic complexity in large-scale point clouds and Mamba's inefficiency in 3D feature representation, and to find a way to combine their complementary strengths.

Method: The proposed HybridTM architecture integrates Transformer and Mamba frameworks, complemented by the Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy to merge attention mechanisms and Mamba capabilities at a finer granularity for enhanced feature extraction.

Result: Experiments indicate HybridTM's effectiveness and generalization across diverse datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes.

Conclusion: HybridTM successfully addresses limitations of existing methods and advances capabilities in 3D semantic segmentation. Its hybrid approach demonstrates improved efficiency and representation ability in large-scale point cloud tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,
ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks. The code will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DRWKV model for low-light image enhancement, focusing on edge fidelity and structural detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in preserving edge continuity and fine details in images under extreme low-light conditions.

Method: Proposes DRWKV with innovative components like Global Edge Retinex (GER), spiral-scanning Evolving WKV Attention, and Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) with MS2-Loss.

Result: Outperforms on five benchmarks using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE, with low computational cost, and shows improved results in low-light multi-object tracking.

Conclusion: DRWKV improves low-light image enhancement, enhances downstream tasks, and is computationally efficient, showcasing its practical utility and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

*Ye-Chan Kim,SeungJu Cha,Si-Woo Kim,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIDA, a zero-shot domain adaptation method using synthetic images instead of text descriptions for target domain styles, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced adaptation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven zero-shot domain adaptation methods face challenges in capturing complex real-world variations and have high adaptation times.

Method: The paper introduces SIDA, which utilizes synthetic images by generating source-like images and translating them to reflect target domain styles. Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer modules are used to simulate real-world variations.

Result: SIDA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in a variety of zero-shot adaptation tasks, particularly in challenging domains, while significantly reducing adaptation time.

Conclusion: SIDA's use of synthetic images and novel modules offers an efficient and effective solution to zero-shot domain adaptation, providing diverse style cues without relying on text descriptions.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

### [164] [Identifying Prompted Artist Names from Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18633)
*Grace Su,Sheng-Yu Wang,Aaron Hertzmann,Eli Shechtman,Jun-Yan Zhu,Richard Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a benchmark to evaluate how well text-to-image models can identify artists named in prompts just from generated images. It tests with 1.95M images and finds room for improvement in artist style recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study is motivated by ethical concerns and growing controversy surrounding the unauthorized use of artists’ styles in text-to-image models, driving the need for methods to identify such instances.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark dataset comprising 1.95M images involving 110 artists, exploring various generalization scenarios such as held-out artists, composite prompts, multi-artist prompts, and different models. They evaluate multiple techniques, including supervised classifiers, style descriptors, and few-shot prototypical networks.

Result: The paper finds that supervised and few-shot classifiers perform well for known artists and intricate prompts, while style descriptors transfer better for distinctive artistic styles. However, recognition involving multi-artist prompts remains challenging.

Conclusion: The benchmark uncovers critical gaps in recognizing artists' styles from generated prompts, aiming to promote accountability and ethical use in text-to-image models. The dataset and benchmark are publicly released to drive future research and advancements.

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

TL;DR: Captain Cinema is a framework for generating visually coherent and narratively consistent short movies based on detailed textual storylines. It integrates keyframe planning and video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the automated generation of high-quality short movies that maintain narrative coherence and visual consistency.

Method: The approach introduces a two-step process: (1) keyframe planning for capturing the storyline visually, (2) video synthesis for creating spatio-temporal dynamics between keyframes. It employs an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT).

Result: Experiments show that Captain Cinema effectively creates visually coherent and narratively consistent short movies in a stable and efficient manner.

Conclusion: Captain Cinema advances the narrative-driven automated movie creation process, offering a novel tool for synthesizing high-quality cinematic videos efficiently.

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces IOTA, a system improving decentralized large language model training by fostering cooperation and incentivizing fair contributions among miners to scale model sizes beyond single-machine limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) include local model constraints and competitive reward mechanisms, which hinder scalability and collaboration within decentralized pretraining networks.

Method: The authors propose IOTA, which includes a distributed, data- and pipeline-parallel orchestration system; a fair incentive mechanism; activation compression to reduce bandwidth; Butterfly All-Reduce for parameter averaging; and CLASP for fair and exploitable-resistant contribution attribution.

Result: Preliminary results demonstrate that IOTA allows model scaling beyond single-machine constraints, rewards contributors fairly, achieves communication bandwidth reductions of up to 128x, and improves training speed and scalability while enabling redundancy and collusion detection.

Conclusion: IOTA addresses SN9's issues by transforming isolated competitors into a cooperative, scalable, and incentivized network, paving the way for more efficient and fair decentralized pretraining of large language models.

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

*Kan Zhu,Haiyang Shi,Le Xu,Jiaxin Shan,Arvind Krishnamurthy,Baris Kasikci,Liguang Xie*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PolyServe, a novel system for managing diverse LLM application requests with varying latency requirements, achieving significantly improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies in serving diverse latency-sensitive requests in LLM applications, where existing systems handle latency sensitivity too coarsely, leading to suboptimal user experiences.

Method: PolyServe groups requests into bins based on latency requirements, assigns them to subsets of servers, adapts scheduling dynamically, and allows certain overlaps in resource allocation. Profiling data and innovative techniques (e.g., chunking, prefill prediction) guide its functioning.

Result: PolyServe outperforms existing policies with a significant 1.23x goodput gain and achieves up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Conclusion: PolyServe effectively addresses challenges in multi-latency scheduling scenarios, ensuring efficient resource utilization, controlled tail latency, and improved system performance for LLM-powered applications.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

*Pei-Kun Yang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study evaluates five QUBO solvers (Neal, PyTorch CPU/GPU, JAX, SciPy) by comparing solution quality, scalability, and runtime on large QUBO matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QUBO is a widely-used framework for combinatorial optimization, and understanding the trade-offs among software solvers for large problems is crucial for practical applications.

Method: The study benchmarks five QUBO solvers on matrices from 1000x1000 to 45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds, comparing their solution quality (energy) and runtime performance.

Result: Neal achieved the best solution quality but had memory limitations. PyTorch offered a good balance of scalability and runtime efficiency, while JAX performed similarly but on fewer variables. SciPy had the worst performance.

Conclusion: For large-scale QUBO problems, PyTorch is recommended due to its balance between solution quality, scalability, and runtime, especially when computational resources (GPU/CPU) are available.

Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a versatile framework
for modeling combinatorial optimization problems. This study benchmarks five
software-based QUBO solvers: Neal, PyTorch (CPU), PyTorch (GPU), JAX, and
SciPy, on randomly generated QUBO matrices ranging from 1000x1000 to
45000x45000, under six convergence thresholds from 10^-1 to 10^-6. We evaluate
their performance in terms of solution quality (energy) and computational time.
Among the solvers tested, Neal achieved the lowest energy values but was
limited to problems with up to 6000 variables due to high memory consumption.
PyTorch produced slightly higher energy results than Neal but demonstrated
superior scalability, solving instances with up to 45000 variables. Its support
for GPU acceleration and CPU multi-threading also resulted in significantly
shorter runtimes. JAX yielded energy values slightly above those of PyTorch and
was limited to 25000 variables, with runtimes comparable to PyTorch on GPU.
SciPy was the most constrained solver, handling only up to 6000 variables and
consistently producing the highest energy values with the longest computation
times. These findings highlight trade-offs between solution quality,
scalability, and runtime efficiency, and suggest that PyTorch is the most
balanced choice for large-scale QUBO problems when computational resources
permit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiencies in system integration and execution frameworks for heterogeneous architectures implementing modern CNNs, particularly in the context of deep learning accelerators and embedded platforms.

Method: The paper evaluates the integration of RISC-V Vector 1.0 extension to optimize memory and execution frameworks, experimentally identifying performance bottlenecks and showing its benefits in reducing pre-processing and fallback processing.

Result: Experiments achieved up to a 9x speedup in image pre-processing and up to a 3x improvement in YOLOv3 fallback layer execution compared to CPU-only solutions.

Conclusion: RISC-V Vector 1.0 provides a flexible programming model to improve computation and memory balance in deep learning workloads, with significant speed and power efficiency improvements on embedded platforms.

Abstract: The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting
deep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of
modern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant
development is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most
expensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural
processing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of
traditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance
tradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system
integration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these
heterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system
integration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution
in these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware
integration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory
hierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally
verify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at
runtime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator
speedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V
Vector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within
a well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and
CPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image
pre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.
We demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable
a balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs
supporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than
traditional parallel execution platforms.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiKernelBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 285 tasks for evaluating deep learning kernel generation using large language models across Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs, highlighting hardware support gaps and effective prompting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based DL kernel generation lack hardware diversity, specific task categorization, and balanced task coverage, providing an incomplete evaluation perspective.

Method: The authors created MultiKernelBench with 14 defined kernel categories, cross-platform support, and a modular backend abstraction. They introduced a category-aware one-shot prompting method to enhance generation quality.

Result: Evaluations of seven LLMs revealed variability in task difficulty, limitations in generalization for less-exposed hardware platforms, and improved generation through targeted prompting.

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench exposes critical limitations in current LLM-based kernel generation practices and suggests category-aware prompting as an effective strategy, offering a foundation for inclusive cross-platform benchmarking.

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

*Talha Mehboob,Luanzheng Guo,Nathan Tallent,Michael Zink,David Irwin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces PowerTrip, a system aimed at optimizing the power-communication trade-off in training large AI models across geo-distributed sites by dynamically selecting a subset of sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing computational and power needs of large AI models, alongside the limitations of single data centers and regional power grids, necessitate distributing workloads across multiple sites. However, this introduces communication overhead and latency as a key challenge.

Method: PowerTrip dynamically selects sites during runtime based on a power-to-cost heuristic that prioritizes high power availability and low network latency. A dynamic greedy approach is used to measure marginal gains in training efficiency, balancing computational power with network penalties.

Result: Using real-world power traces from Google, PowerTrip reduced time-to-accuracy by up to 50% compared to baseline policies, showcasing its effectiveness in optimizing large-scale AI training in power-constrained environments.

Conclusion: PowerTrip effectively addresses the challenges of power and communication overhead in geo-distributed AI training, offering significant performance gains and showcasing the potential for more efficient distributed AI workloads.

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale AI models has led to computational and
power demands that can exceed the capacity of a single data center. This is due
to the limited power supplied by regional grids that leads to limited regional
computational power. Consequently, distributing training workloads across
geographically distributed sites has become essential. However, this approach
introduces a significant challenge in the form of communication overhead,
creating a fundamental trade-off between the performance gains from accessing
greater aggregate power and the performance losses from increased network
latency. Although prior work has focused on reducing communication volume or
using heuristics for distribution, these methods assume constant homogeneous
power supplies and ignore the challenge of heterogeneous power availability
between sites.
  To address the challenge of training large models in power-constrained,
geo-distributed environments, we introduce PowerTrip, a system that dynamically
selects a subset of sites during runtime to optimize the power-communication
trade-off. Specifically, PowerTrip selects sites based on a power-to-cost
heuristic, prioritizing those with high power availability and low network
latency. PowerTrip employs a dynamic greedy approach and uses the marginal gain
in training efficiency, i.e., accuracy improvement per unit of time, to
optimize for the number of sites where the performance penalty from network
overhead negates the benefit of adding more computational power. Our
evaluation, which uses real-world Google power traces to model realistic power
capacity constraints, demonstrates that PowerTrip can reduce time-to-accuracy
by up to 50% compared to existing baseline policies.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper discusses the design of the C-Koordinator platform for handling resource competition in co-located microservices clusters using an interference metric called CPI, achieving over 90.3% prediction accuracy and improving system performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address resource competition and interference in co-located microservices clusters, which impacts application performance, especially in large-scale and diverse environments with unreliable metrics.

Method: The paper utilizes CPI (cycles per instruction) as a metric for interference measurement and adopts multi-dimensional metrics for accurate CPI prediction. It further introduces the design of an open-source platform, C-Koordinator, which is deployed on Alibaba clusters.

Result: The interference prediction models used in the study achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling effective interference mitigation. Improvements in application latency, ranging from 16.7% to 36.1% under various loads, were reported compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that interference-aware strategies using CPI can significantly enhance overall application stability and performance in co-located microservices environments.

Abstract: Microservices transform traditional monolithic applications into lightweight,
loosely coupled application components and have been widely adopted in many
enterprises. Cloud platform infrastructure providers enhance the resource
utilization efficiency of microservices systems by co-locating different
microservices. However, this approach also introduces resource competition and
interference among microservices. Designing interference-aware strategies for
large-scale, co-located microservice clusters is crucial for enhancing resource
utilization and mitigating competition-induced interference. These challenges
are further exacerbated by unreliable metrics, application diversity, and node
heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of large-scale and
co-located microservices clusters at Alibaba and further discuss why cycle per
instruction (CPI) is adopted as a metric for interference measurement in
large-scale production clusters, as well as how to achieve accurate prediction
of CPI through multi-dimensional metrics. Based on CPI interference prediction
and analysis, we also present the design of the C-Koordinator platform, an
open-source solution utilized in Alibaba cluster, which incorporates
co-location and interference mitigation strategies. The interference prediction
models consistently achieve over 90.3% accuracy, enabling precise prediction
and rapid mitigation of interference in operational environments. As a result,
application latency is reduced and stabilized across all percentiles (P50, P90,
P99) response time (RT), achieving improvements ranging from 16.7% to 36.1%
under various system loads compared with state-of-the-art system. These results
demonstrate the system's ability to maintain smooth application performance in
co-located environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoCoServe, an elastic system that optimizes LLM serving by introducing module-level scaling and migration, reducing costs and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in static deployments of LLM serving systems, which struggle with resource allocation, performance degradation, and high scaling costs under dynamic workloads.

Method: The authors propose CoCoServe, a system that enables dynamic and fine-grained scaling through module-level replication and migration. They analyze trade-offs of these operations and develop an auto-scaling mechanism for resource allocation and performance optimization.

Result: CoCoServe achieves a 46% cost reduction while maintaining availability. It reduces latency by 14%-75% and improves throughput by 1.16x-4x compared to existing systems like Hugging Face Transformers.

Conclusion: The study concludes that module-level scaling can significantly enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of LLM serving systems, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new opportunities across
various fields but has also introduced significant challenges in resource
management. Current LLM serving systems face a fundamental tension: balancing
serving demands with limited resources while adapting to unpredictable traffic
patterns. Static deployments lead to suboptimal resource utilization and
performance degradation under dynamic workloads. Furthermore, the high cost of
adjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of
efficient LLM serving.
  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates
dynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level
operations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder
layers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs
associated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that
dynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance
optimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation
demonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit
excellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining
availability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging
Face Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and
achieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and
workloads.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that Cloud Native technologies could reshape scalable LLM inference serving in cloud environments and offer valuable insights for the broader cloud computing and AI industry.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing numerous industries, but
their substantial computational demands create challenges for efficient

TL;DR: The paper introduces FCPO, a hybrid approach combining Continual RL and Federated RL to enhance real-time inference for Edge Video Analytics, yielding significant improvements in throughput, latency, convergence, and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fast-evolving nature of Edge environments creates bottlenecks for real-time inference serving systems despite the potential for intelligent applications. Current RL scheduling strategies face issues of adaptability and scalability.

Method: Proposes and implements FCPO, combining Continual Relearning (CRL) to adapt to changing environments and Federated RL (FRL) to improve generalizability and learning speed. It employs a diversity-aware experience buffer and agent-specific aggregation.

Result: Achieves over 5 times improvement in throughput, 60% latency reduction, 20% faster convergence, and up to 10 times lower memory usage compared to leading RL methods, as demonstrated in a real-world testbed.

Conclusion: The FCPO framework effectively leverages Continual and Federated RL to address scalability and adaptability issues, advancing performance and resource efficiency for Edge Video Analytics systems.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Edge Video Analytics (EVA) facilitates new kind of
intelligent applications, but creates challenges in real-time inference serving
systems. State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload
distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended
scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge
environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments
between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability
issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated
RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts
inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and
post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision
Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves
generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across
inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme
and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA
testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced
latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption
compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.

Motivation: Conventional simulation engines face scalability limits, and existing PDES implementations, like Warped2, struggle with inefficiencies in synchronization and complex entity interactions.

Method: The framework integrates asynchronous listener threads, METIS-based load balancing, a constraint-solving entity interaction mechanism, and spatial hashing to address performance bottlenecks and enhance scalability.

Result: The framework demonstrates 16x acceleration compared to baseline, 8x speedup over single-thread configurations, and reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing contributing 57% of improvements.

Conclusion: This optimized PDES framework offers substantial benefits in performance efficiency, temporal fidelity, and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale simulation scenarios.

Abstract: Rising demand for complex simulations highlights conventional
engines'scalability limits, spurring Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)
adoption.Warped2, a PDES engine leveraging Time Warp synchronization with
Pending Event Set optimization, delivers strong performance, it struggles with
inherent wargaming limitations: inefficient LP resource allocation during
synchronization and unaddressed complex entity interaction patterns. To address
these challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic
improvements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event
monitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling
mechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to
address the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3)
Entity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed
to mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome
O(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches.
Experimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant
enhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark
results show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline
implementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI
and Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration
strategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing
accounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization
factor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation
in large-scale simulation scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based strategy for data replication in cloud systems to adapt to workload changes dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable distributed systems to handle growing data volumes with high service quality has led to exploring dynamic adjustments in data replication, moving away from static threshold-based methods.

Method: The paper employs reinforcement learning to develop a dynamic data replication strategy by defining system states, actions, and reward functions.

Result: The proposed approach aims to optimize quality of service while balancing provider profit and environmental impact.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning provides an adaptive framework for smarter data replication management, enhancing cloud system performance and sustainability.

Abstract: The rapid growth of global data volumes has created a demand for scalable
distributed systems that can maintain a high quality of service. Data
replication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved
performance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on
threshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload
changes and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the
responsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,
reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and
different architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication
strategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically
learn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim
is to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off
between provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture
behind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining
the states, actions and rewards.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuaRC, a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) framework that employs coresets and advanced strategies to efficiently train low-bit quantized models on edge devices, improving accuracy while using minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for low-bit quantized models on edge devices necessitates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), but traditional QAT incurs significant computational costs and struggles with accuracy when using small datasets.

Method: QuaRC introduces 'Relative Entropy Score' for coreset selection and 'Cascaded Layer Correction' for reducing quantization errors during training, allowing efficient model retraining on edge devices.

Result: QuaRC significantly improves performance; for example, it achieves a 5.72% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K when quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using only 1% of the data.

Conclusion: QuaRC effectively addresses the challenges of training quantized models on edge devices with small datasets, offering a computationally efficient and high-accuracy solution.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper designs a generalized AI model for improved data reconstruction in semantic communication using causality-invariant learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the channel decoder for semantic communication by integrating common semantic knowledge for reliable and domain-consistent data reconstruction.

Method: A generative adversarial network with causality-invariant learning is used to extract and utilize causal representations for robust data reconstruction, alongside sparse update protocols to adapt to evolving user-collected data.

Result: The model ensures consistency across devices, excels in classification tasks for semantic communications, and achieves superior PSNR in data reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Causality-invariant learning effectively enhances the reliability, robustness, and performance of semantic communication systems while maintaining low communication overheads.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of how hidden-layer self-similarity influences weight optimization and neuron behavior in deep neural networks.

Method: Introduced complex network modeling for hidden-layer output features to analyze and adjust self-similarity across different network types.

Result: Validated improvements in classification performance with self-similarity constraints across MLP and attention architectures, achieving up to 6% performance gains.

Conclusion: Adjusting self-similarity in feature networks can play a pivotal role in improving the performance of certain deep neural network architectures.

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address computational challenges in aerodynamic optimization and explore how optimization outcomes can provide insights into desired flow-field trends.

Method: The method uses an RL-based adaptive approach incorporating surrogate-based actor-critic policy evaluation combined with MCMC. Temporal freezing of optimization parameters and local parameter changes around CFD simulations are emphasized.

Result: The proposed approach accelerates global optimization and offers a feature importance scoring framework by leveraging local neighborhood parameter adjustments under specific conditions.

Conclusion: This RL-based method is effective in reducing computational demand and guiding aerodynamic optimization using interpretable results.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

*Neil He,Hiren Madhu,Ngoc Bui,Menglin Yang,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews how hyperbolic geometry can address fundamental limitations in foundation models' performance and suggests future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models using Euclidean geometry face limitations: limited representational capacity, low adaptability, and diminishing scalability. This raises the question of whether non-Euclidean geometries like hyperbolic spaces could better align with real-world data.

Method: The authors focus on hyperbolic spaces, exploring their properties such as hierarchical structure embedding and advantages in parameter efficiency. They discuss the application of hyperbolic neural networks for enhancing diverse foundation models.

Result: Hyperbolic spaces have shown improvements across tasks like better reasoning in large language models, improved zero-shot generalization for vision-language models, and enhanced cross-modal semantic alignment, all while being parameter-efficient.

Conclusion: Integrating hyperbolic geometries into foundation models offers promise but requires further research to solve current challenges and optimize its application in real-world AI tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

### [186] [Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17788)
*Ali Vardasbi,Gustavo Penha,Claudia Hauff,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses position bias and repetition consistency in LLMs ranking tasks and proposes a dynamic early-stopping method to reduce computation costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate position bias and low repetition consistency issues in LLMs without overly increasing computational costs.

Method: The authors introduce a dynamic early-stopping mechanism that determines the necessary number of repetitions adaptively for each instance and propose a confidence-based adaptation to further optimize LLM calls.

Result: The proposed approach reduces LLM calls by an average of 81%, preserving accuracy; the confidence-based adaptation reduces calls by 87%, with minimal accuracy trade-off.

Conclusion: Dynamic repetition strategies can effectively address LLM biases with significantly reduced computational overhead, ensuring practical implementation advantages.

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CICME, a method to identify causal mechanisms from diverse data across domains and shows its robust performance in manufacturing-scenario-inspired tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for uncovering causal mechanisms from diverse datasets across multiple domains, providing insights into complex sensor systems.

Method: The paper presents CICME, a three-step causal mechanism estimation algorithm leveraging Causal Transfer Learning (CTL) to detect domain-invariant mechanisms and perform individual domain estimations.

Result: CICME was tested on linear Gaussian models in manufacturing-like scenarios and demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: CICME effectively combines pooled data analysis with individual domain analysis, advancing causal discovery methods and showcasing advantages over existing techniques in particular use cases.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoCAI, a novel framework combining generative AI, copula-based modeling, and conformal prediction for accurate multivariate time-series forecasting and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle critical challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: ensuring accurate predictions and developing robust anomaly detection methods.

Method: The proposed framework, CoCAI, employs a diffusion-based generative model for dependency capture, conformal prediction for statistical calibration, and a copula-based anomaly score technique using dimensionality reduction.

Result: Empirical evaluations on operational data from water distribution and sewerage systems demonstrate CoCAI's effectiveness in forecasting and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CoCAI delivers a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient solution adaptable for real-world applications in time-series analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Tong Li,Zhu Xiao,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSDM, a model combining diffusion models, transformers, and Large Language Models (LLMs), for better prediction of service-level mobile traffic, achieving improved accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile traffic prediction methods struggle with adaptability across urban contexts, and they fail to account for high personal traffic uncertainty, environmental details, and service dependencies.

Method: The proposed LSDM model combines diffusion models for distribution modeling, transformers for adaptive learning, and LLMs for incorporating multimodal environmental and contextual information.

Result: The model demonstrated superior accuracy and adaptability with at least a 2.83% improvement in R-squared and a minimum of 8.29% reduction in RMSE compared to other models like CSDI.

Conclusion: LSDM effectively integrates advanced modeling techniques to improve service-level traffic predictions, showing strong generalization and adaptability. Its implementation is available publicly for reproducibility.

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

*Lakshmana Sri Harsha Nemani,P. K. Srijith,Tomasz Kuśmierczyk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for efficient and robust uncertainty estimation in Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring multiple forward passes by using uncertainty-aware teacher models distilled into compact student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of computationally expensive uncertainty quantification in standard LLMs by offering a method that doesn't sacrifice model performance or efficiency.

Method: The method involves distilling uncertainty-aware teacher models into student models with the same architecture, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Two distillation strategies are compared: one with traditional softmax outputs and another with Dirichlet-distributed outputs via evidential learning.

Result: The proposed student models achieve comparable or better predictive performance and uncertainty quantification compared to their teacher models while reducing computational requirements to a single forward pass.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that robust and immediate uncertainty quantification in LLMs can be achieved using evidential distillation approaches, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenSelect, leveraging LLM comparative abilities to efficiently select solutions among multiple candidates, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative reward models either underutilize LLM comparative strengths with pointwise scoring or scale inefficiently with pairwise comparisons for reasoning tasks.

Method: GenSelect utilizes long reasoning within LLMs to select the best solution among candidates, leveraging parallel sampling for scalable comparison.

Result: For math reasoning, models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528 demonstrate superior performance in GenSelect compared to traditional scoring approaches.

Conclusion: GenSelect optimizes the selection process by combining scalability and effective utilization of LLM reasoning capabilities, enhancing reasoning task performance.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for high-resolution precipitation downscaling, emphasizing perceptual realism while slightly sacrificing conventional evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting stationary and localized heavy rainfall at high resolution remains a challenge, which is crucial to mitigate damage caused by such events.

Method: The authors apply WGAN with an optimal transport cost for precipitation downscaling. Unlike conventional neural networks that optimize mean squared error, WGAN emphasizes perceptual realism.

Result: WGAN generates visually realistic precipitation patterns with fine details, though it performs slightly worse on traditional evaluation metrics. Its critic scores align closely with human perceptions of realism.

Conclusion: The WGAN framework enhances perceptual realism in downscaling precipitation and provides tools for evaluating and quality-controlling datasets.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

*Varsha Ramineni,Hossein A. Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in fairness testing of AI models when demographic data is inaccessible, proposing the use of synthetic datasets for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI decision-making in high-stakes contexts is prone to biases, necessitating effective fairness testing, especially under regulatory requirements. However, the lack of access to demographic data poses significant challenges.

Method: The authors propose constructing synthetic datasets by leveraging overlapping datasets to simulate demographics and assess fairness. They tested the fidelity and accuracy of these synthetic datasets against real-world data.

Result: The research demonstrates that fairness metrics using synthetic data are consistent with those derived from actual demographic data.

Conclusion: Synthetic datasets can reliably enable fairness testing and serve as a substitute for demographic data, supporting independent, robust bias evaluations of AI models in contexts with limited data availability.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

TL;DR: GraphEXT, a novel explainability framework using cooperative game theory, improves fidelity and explainability for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by focusing on node interactions and structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs, while highly effective, lack inherent explainability, and current methods fail to adequately address complex node interaction patterns and structural dynamics.

Method: GraphEXT combines cooperative game theory with social externalities, creating coalitions of nodes and leveraging Shapley values adjusted for structural externalities to measure node importance.

Result: GraphEXT demonstrated enhanced performance in fidelity and explainability compared to existing methods across a range of GNN architectures using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GraphEXT significantly improves the explainability of GNNs by shifting focus to structural influences and node interactions, achieving superior fidelity in predictions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'molecular task arithmetic,' a method to generate molecules with desirable properties by leveraging only negative examples and moving models in opposite property directions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of positively-labeled molecules constrains generative molecule design, necessitating innovative approaches that bypass this limitation.

Method: The method involves training on diverse negative examples to learn property directions and subsequently generating positive molecules by moving models in opposite directions.

Result: Molecular task arithmetic outperformed models trained on positive molecules in 20 zero-shot experiments, producing more diverse and successful designs even in dual-objective and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Molecular task arithmetic is a promising transfer learning strategy for molecule design, combining simplicity, data efficiency, and effective performance.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

Motivation: To address the limitations of standard Fourier Neural Operators in handling non-periodic inputs and improve efficiency in modeling stochastic systems.

Method: Develops an MFNO architecture by adding mirror padding to the original FNO, supported by rigorous theoretical proofs using Wong-Zakai theorems and approximation techniques.

Result: MFNO demonstrates superior resolution generalization, comparable or better performance than traditional baselines like LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet, and faster sample path generation.

Conclusion: MFNO provides an efficient, accurate solution for modeling stochastic systems with non-periodic inputs, outperforming classical numerical schemes and existing neural architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of distribution shifts in combining public and private data for differentially private machine learning, finding limitations in their complementary value for Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the usefulness of combining public and private data in differentially private machine learning when the data sources exhibit significant distribution shifts.

Method: The authors analyze and extend lower bounds on the efficacy of combining public-private data in scenarios like Gaussian mean estimation and Gaussian linear regression under distribution shifts.

Result: It is found that minor distribution shifts require sufficient abundance of either public or private data, while large shifts render public data unhelpful.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of combining public and private data heavily depends on the scale of distribution shifts, with limited or no advantage in certain scenarios.

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

*Jiyue Tao,Tongsheng Shen,Dexin Zhao,Feitian Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARBoids, an approach combining reinforcement learning with the Boids model, to enhance interception of adversarial USVs even when attackers are highly maneuverable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in defending a target region from highly maneuverable adversarial USVs using autonomous defense systems.

Method: The method integrates a biologically inspired Boids model for baseline behaviors with deep reinforcement learning to refine actions using a residual learning approach.

Result: The ARBoids framework outperforms traditional methods in high-fidelity simulations and adapts well to attackers with different maneuverability.

Conclusion: ARBoids is robust, efficient, and generalizable, making it a promising solution for challenging multi-agent defense problems involving USVs.

Abstract: The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)
concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target
region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario
arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the
defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this
challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual
reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this
framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline
policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to
adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is
validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating
superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure
force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned
policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability
profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code
of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.

*Phu Thien Nguyen,Yousef Heider,Dennis M. Kochmann,Fadi Aldakheel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the inverse design of porous metamaterials via a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), which combines a variational autoencoder and a regressor to design structures with specific hydraulic properties while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational challenges in designing porous metamaterials with tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability, by leveraging deep learning methods.

Method: A property-variational autoencoder (pVAE) framework is developed and trained on synthetic microstructural datasets and CT-scanned foam images. It utilizes a CNN for property prediction and reduces simulation costs via a bottom-up approach.

Result: The framework successfully maps microstructural features into an interpretable latent space for structure-property relationships, demonstrating efficiency in interpolation and inverse design.

Conclusion: This deep learning-based generative framework enables the efficient design of porous metamaterials with user-specified properties, and its datasets and code are open-access to facilitate further research.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

*Charles H Martin,Christopher Hinrichs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) to explain the performance of state-of-the-art neural networks (SOTA NNs), using concepts from heavy-tailed self-regularization and statistical mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a formal explanation for the remarkable performance and prediction accuracies of SOTA NNs by exploring the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of heavy-tailed layer quality metrics.

Method: SETOL combines statistical mechanics, random matrix theory, and quantum chemistry techniques to derive novel mathematical preconditions for learning, introducing the ERG metric related to renormalization group techniques.

Result: SETOL's assumptions and predictions were successfully validated on a simple 3-layer MLP, and its layer quality metrics, including HTSR alpha and ERG, showed strong agreement with observed performance metrics in SOTA NNs.

Conclusion: SETOL offers a robust framework for understanding and predicting NN performance through empirical spectral density analyses, enhancing theoretical insights into NN layer qualities.

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

*Jessica Quaye,Charvi Rastogi,Alicia Parrish,Oana Inel,Minsuk Kahng,Lora Aroyo,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Seed2Harvest, a hybrid method combining human-crafted and machine-generated adversarial prompts to improve the reliability and scalability of text-to-image model evaluations under adversarial conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models require robust evaluation against adversarial attacks, but existing human-crafted or synthetic prompts suffer from either lack of scale or creativity.

Method: The authors developed a hybrid red-teaming approach called Seed2Harvest, which expands human-crafted prompts through guided machine-assisted generation.

Result: Seed2Harvest achieves higher diversity, with 535 unique geographic locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, along with comparable attack success rates.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of human-machine collaboration for enhancing adversarial robustness and safety evaluations in T2I models.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

*Hongrong Yang,Markus Schlaepfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanPulse introduces a scalable deep learning framework for fine-grained city-wide population flow predictions, leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to capture spatial structures, scale across cities, and often limit resolution by clustering POIs or restricting regions.

Method: UrbanPulse combines a graph convolutional encoder and a transformer decoder, along with a three-stage transfer learning strategy for robust predictions.

Result: Evaluations on GPS records from California cities show UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing high-resolution urban forecasting, making it deployable across diverse metropolitan areas.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

### [206] [Multimodal Fine-grained Reasoning for Post Quality Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17934)
*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MFTRR framework to improve post-quality assessment using multimodal data, addressing challenges like semantic processing and noise introduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-quality assessment struggles with unimodal categorization, multimodal data noise, and capturing semantic complexity.

Method: MFTRR reframes the task as a ranking problem using two main modules: (1) local-global semantic correlation reasoning, (2) multi-level evidential relational reasoning.

Result: MFTRR achieves significant improvements in evaluation metrics, such as up to 9.52% NDCG@3 improvement on a specific dataset compared to unimodal methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MFTRR framework effectively enhances post-quality assessment through advanced relational reasoning and noise reduction techniques.

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the prediction of brain activity patterns (fMRI) using multimodal data extracted from movies and robust model architectures.

Method: VIBE incorporates representations from multiple pre-trained models, merges them via a modality-fusion transformer, and decodes temporally using a prediction transformer with rotary embeddings, trained on a large video dataset with ensemble learning.

Result: On the Friends S07 dataset, VIBE achieves a mean Pearson correlation of 32.25, and on six out-of-distribution films, it scores 21.25. It also performed notably in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge with earlier architecture versions.

Conclusion: The proposed VIBE model demonstrates effective prediction capabilities for fMRI activity, showcasing strong generalization from in-distribution to out-of-distribution data and competitive performance in challenges.

Abstract: We present VIBE, a two-stage Transformer that fuses multi-modal video, audio,
and text features to predict fMRI activity. Representations from open-source
models (Qwen2.5, BEATs, Whisper, SlowFast, V-JEPA) are merged by a
modality-fusion transformer and temporally decoded by a prediction transformer
with rotary embeddings. Trained on 65 hours of movie data from the CNeuroMod
dataset and ensembled across 20 seeds, VIBE attains mean parcel-wise Pearson
correlations of 32.25 on in-distribution Friends S07 and 21.25 on six
out-of-distribution films. An earlier iteration of the same architecture
obtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second
overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper enhances the transformer-based GeoAggregator model for geospatial tabular data by improving computational efficiency and adding explainability features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate modeling and interpretation of geospatial tabular data, especially given the advancements in transformer-based models.

Method: Optimized the data loading and computational pipeline, integrated model ensembling, and added an explanation feature via the GeoShapley framework.

Result: The improved GA model demonstrated increased prediction accuracy, faster inference speed, and effective spatial effects capture in synthetic data experiments.

Conclusion: The work advances both the performance and explainability of the GeoAggregator model, and the pipeline is publicly available for community use.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SIFOTL, a method using summary statistics and machine learning to identify factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets, particularly in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing shifts in tabular datasets while preserving privacy and handling noisy observational data is a critical challenge, especially in sectors like healthcare.

Method: SIFOTL extracts privacy-safe summary statistics, applies twin XGBoost models to separate intervention signals from noise (with LLM support), and combines these outputs using a Pareto-weighted decision tree, offering an interpretable framework.

Result: For a Medicare drug subsidy simulation using MEPS data, SIFOTL achieved an F1 score of 0.85, outperforming baselines significantly. It also maintained F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 for clean data and >= 0.75 for noisy data across 18 EHR datasets, surpassing baselines consistently.

Conclusion: SIFOTL provides a robust, privacy-compliant, and interpretable method for identifying data shifts in tabular datasets, even in the presence of noise.

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Machine Unlearning paradigm for traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) to allow models to selectively forget sensitive or outdated data, addressing privacy and trust issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abundance of data in traffic estimation raises privacy and cybersecurity concerns. Regulations such as "right to be forgotten" demand mechanisms for removing sensitive data from machine learning models.

Method: The paper proposes a novel machine unlearning paradigm specifically designed for TSEP models, enabling selective removal of privacy-sensitive or undesired data after training.

Result: The proposed unlearning approach allows trained models to erase specific data, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of traffic prediction systems.

Conclusion: Machine Unlearning enhances the adaptability of TSEP systems by addressing privacy and data modification requirements, thereby making intelligent transportation systems more trustworthy.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs using reinforcement learning methods like GRPO requires significant computational resources, making optimization necessary.

Method: Researchers developed a predictive framework that empirically models training dynamics using scaling laws derived from experiments on Llama and Qwen models.

Result: Three phases in training dynamics were identified: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. An empirical scaling law predicts reward trajectories and suggests earlier stopping to save resources.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning across model types, optimizing compute usage without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ocean current data from sources like Copernicus lack sufficient spatial resolution for detailed local analyses such as coastal management and maritime safety.

Method: They propose a supervised deep learning framework using neural operators capable of downscaling and solving PDEs at arbitrary resolutions.

Result: The framework was tested on Copernicus ocean current data and synthetic Navier-Stokes datasets, showing promising results in improving resolution.

Conclusion: The method offers a novel approach to enhancing oceanographic data granularity through deep learning, making it a significant tool for scientific computing and oceanography.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Result: GSPO outperforms the GRPO algorithm in training efficiency and performance, stabilizes MoE RL training, and simplifies RL infrastructure.

Conclusion: GSPO has significantly contributed to advancements in Qwen3 models, showcasing its potential as a superior alternative in RL-based language model training.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the

*Ryusei Fujimoto,Yugo Nakamura,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces C-AAE, a privacy-preserving method for wearable sensor data that reduces user re-identification and shrinks data size while maintaining activity recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable sensors can compromise privacy by enabling user re-identification, necessitating methods to protect sensitive data in healthcare applications.

Method: C-AAE combines an Anonymizing AutoEncoder (AAE) to suppress identity cues with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM) for further masking identity information and reducing data size.

Result: C-AAE significantly reduces user re-identification accuracy (10-15 percentage point drop) and decreases data volume by 75% while slightly affecting activity recognition performance.

Conclusion: C-AAE is a practical solution for optimizing the balance between privacy protection and data utility in sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM offers a mixed-precision quantization framework to compress LLM weights to an average of 1.6 bits, improving performance for extremely low-bit quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce storage and computational costs when deploying LLMs motivates the exploration of ultra low-bit quantization techniques without severely degrading model performance.

Method: This paper proposes a mixed-precision PTQ framework that quantizes 80% of weights to 1-bit and 20% to 4-bits, enhanced by PBAR and FIAS innovations.

Result: Squeeze10-LLM outperforms existing PTQ methods for sub-2bit quantization by improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six tasks.

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM demonstrates that extreme compression is feasible with innovative techniques, closing gaps in performance typically observed in ultra-low-bit quantized models.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

### [216] [Learning from Hard Labels with Additional Supervision on Non-Hard-Labeled Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18098)
*Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving classification models when training data is limited by incorporating additional supervision beyond hard labels, like confidence scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the context of limited training data, using additional label supervision can potentially improve the accuracy of classification models. The paper seeks to identify what forms of additional supervision are beneficial and how they enhance generalization.

Method: A theoretical framework is proposed where both hard labels and additional supervision are modeled as probability distributions. Soft labels are created by combining these elements, analyzed via generalization error bounds and experimental validations.

Result: The crucial factor for additional supervision is the distribution over non-hard-labeled classes, not merely confidence scores. Soft label refinement benefits from the interplay of additional supervision and mixing coefficients, which impact error bounds and improve results.

Conclusion: The theoretical insights and experimental results emphasize that carefully designed additional supervision significantly enhances classification accuracy, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

*Peyman Tehrani,Anas Alsoliman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a solution for efficient resource allocation in an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture using a Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL) approach, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the vital issue of efficient radio access network (RAN) slicing in O-RAN architectures, where multiple MVNOs compete for limited resources while maintaining delay constraints.

Method: The authors devise a reward function derived from the law of large numbers (LLN), adapt it for real-world scenarios, propose the PDA-DRL solution, and introduce a reward-based personalization method for sharing model weights among MVNOs.

Result: The PDA-DRL approach achieves a 38% reduction in average delay compared to baseline models, while the reward-based personalization method outperforms traditional methods like federated averaging.

Conclusion: The proposed PDA-DRL model and reward-based personalization strategy significantly improve delay reductions and resource allocation in a multi-MVNO environment, setting a new benchmark for RAN slicing in O-RAN.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for adversarial attacks on RL systems without modifying the environment, relying on Large Language Models to generate tailored adversarial rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adversarial attacks in reinforcement learning systems without relying on impractical environment or policy modifications.

Method: The authors propose a reward iteration optimization framework using Large Language Models to craft adversarial rewards, along with a state identification algorithm to target system vulnerabilities.

Result: Experiments across different environments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in forcing reinforcement learning agents into suboptimal actions.

Conclusion: The approach presents a practical and superior alternative for adversarial attacks on RL systems by exploiting an agent's vulnerabilities directly.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

*Matthias Otth,Jonas Hübotter,Ido Hakimi,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores how self-improvement mechanisms in language models can enhance mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing a model's prefix-based confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to optimize language model performance for mathematical reasoning tasks without relying on external feedback mechanisms.

Method: They introduced a prefix-confidence scaling approach, where the most promising attempt is chosen using prefix-confidence over multiple datasets, and test-time training is evaluated.

Result: Prefix-confidence scaling proved effective across five datasets, achieving better accuracy-compute trade-offs and reduced susceptibility to length biases compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Prefix-confidence scaling is an efficient and accurate mechanism for improving language model performance in mathematical reasoning tasks, surpassing traditional methods like BoN and test-time training.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

### [221] [When Noisy Labels Meet Class Imbalance on Graphs: A Graph Augmentation Method with LLM and Pseudo Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18153)
*Riting Xia,Rucong Wang,Yulin Liu,Anchen Li,Xueyan Liu,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GraphALP, a framework addressing node classification in class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels using LLM-driven oversampling and pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap where existing approaches for class-imbalanced graph node classification fail to account for noisy labels, which are common in real-world graphs.

Method: Introduces GraphALP, which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for oversampling synthetic minority nodes and dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling to handle noise. A secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism adjusts for skew introduced by pseudo labels.

Result: GraphALP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on class-imbalanced graphs containing noisy labels in experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed GraphALP framework effectively handles label noise and class imbalance in graphs, showcasing its practical applicability.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents ChronoSelect, a framework to handle noisy labels in training datasets using a unique temporal memory approach, showing superior results across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of noisy labels in real-world datasets, which hinder generalization performance by being memorized by over-parameterized models.

Method: The paper introduces ChronoSelect, which utilizes a four-stage memory architecture with a sliding update mechanism that emphasizes recent learning patterns while retaining essential historical data. It also partitions samples into clean, boundary, and noisy subsets using trajectory analysis and dual-branch consistency.

Result: ChronoSelect achieves state-of-the-art performance on noisy label problems in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, with theoretical convergence and stability guarantees.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages temporal dynamics and memory mechanisms to address noisy labels, providing a robust tool for improving neural network training with noisy datasets.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Graph Neural Network for better trajectory prediction of traffic participants, aiming at improved generalization to unseen areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires accurate prediction of traffic participants' future states, which current models struggle with in new environments.

Method: The paper proposes a GNN utilizing a heterogeneous graph combining traffic participant data and vectorized road networks with a multi-staged approach to classify trajectory goals.

Result: Cross-dataset evaluation demonstrates improved effectiveness and generalization, performing well across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances trajectory prediction in autonomous driving systems, showcasing improved adaptability to diverse environments.

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework for graph learning, addressing inefficiencies in synchronous communication and limitations of current asynchronous methods in handling graph data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Federated Graph Learning (FGL) approaches are inefficient due to reliance on synchronous communication, and existing asynchronous methods fail to handle unique graph data properties, leading to model inconsistencies.

Method: FedSA-GCL incorporates inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological characteristics using a novel ClusterCast mechanism for improved semi-asynchronous training.

Result: FedSA-GCL outperforms 9 baselines across multiple real-world graph datasets, showing robustness and efficiency with an average performance improvement of 2.92% (Louvain split) and 3.4% (Metis split).

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL is a robust and efficient solution for federated graph learning, leveraging semi-asynchronous communication and graph-specific features for improved collaborative training outcomes.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new library optimization mechanism (LOM) for the SINDy framework to improve the reliability and interpretability of models used for identifying dynamical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge in SINDy of designing an appropriate library of candidate basis functions, which can be difficult for many dynamical systems.

Method: The method introduces a two-layer optimization approach: an inner layer for sparse regression and an outer layer for optimizing basis functions based on recursive long-term prediction accuracy. Basis functions are parametrized to facilitate this optimization.

Result: The method achieves improved interpretability and usability, reduces user burden through library optimization, and improves model reliability by considering long-term prediction accuracy. Demonstration on a complex diesel engine airpath system validates the approach.

Conclusion: The SINDy-LOM framework offers a more robust and user-friendly way of identifying dynamical systems, showcasing enhanced predictive performance and reduced reliance on user input for library design.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Motivation: Boosting methods based on linear programming lack empirical studies despite their theoretical promise, motivating a comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Large-scale experiments were performed on six LP-based boosting formulations, including NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20 datasets using heuristic and optimal base learners.

Result: LP-based methods showed competitive or superior accuracy to XGBoost and LightGBM with shallow trees, produced sparser ensembles, and were effective at thinning pre-trained ensembles without performance loss.

Conclusion: Totally corrective LP-based boosting methods can match or exceed state-of-the-art heuristics in certain scenarios, offering advantages around sparsity and applicability to ensemble thinning, though optimal decision trees have limitations.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

TL;DR: SiamSA-PPM combines Siamese learning with statistical augmentation to improve Predictive Process Monitoring using enriched event log data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning approaches for Predictive Process Monitoring struggle with low variability and limited data size in event logs.

Method: SiamSA-PPM employs self-supervised learning with statistically grounded transformations to augment event log data and uses a Siamese architecture for representation learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive or superior performance in prediction tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods, with statistical augmentation enhancing data variability.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM provides a promising avenue for training data enrichment and improved process prediction in business workflows.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demand of modern numerical simulations by minimizing problem sizes without compromising accuracy.

Method: The algorithm combines k-means clustering, autodifferentiation, and stochastic minimization to coarsen unstructured grids.

Result: In tests on a linear parabolic equation and wave equation, the algorithm reduced grid points by up to 10 times while preserving the dynamics of interest.

Conclusion: The method is versatile and can be applied to simulate various systems modeled by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of

*Daniele Ghiani,Daniele Angioni,Giorgio Piras,Angelo Sotgiu,Luca Minnei,Srishti Gupta,Maura Pintor,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses security regression in continually learning malware detectors and proposes a new method leveraging Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to reduce regression while maintaining detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware detection systems require continuous updates to keep up with rapidly evolving threats. Traditional retraining on massive datasets is impractical, making continual learning a scalable alternative. However, an often-overlooked risk, security regression, can reintroduce previously detected threats, which compromises trust in the update mechanisms.

Method: The authors formalize and quantify security regression within continual learning for malware detection. They propose adapting Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to mitigate regression in a model-agnostic manner while preserving prior predictive behavior.

Result: Experiments conducted on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce security regression across different continual learning scenarios without sacrificing malware detection performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical issue of security regression in continual learning malware detectors and offers a novel solution that effectively balances regression mitigation with strong detection capabilities.

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

*Janak M. Patel,Milad Ramezankhani,Anirudh Deodhar,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TIDSIT, an innovative architecture for accurately estimating battery State of Health (SoH), outperforming existing models significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating the State of Health (SoH) of batteries is critical due to degradation that affects energy efficiency and safety, with existing machine learning models struggling to process irregular discharge cycle data effectively.

Method: The study introduces TIDSIT (Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer), which uses continuous time embeddings and padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled, variable-length discharge cycle data without losing information.

Result: TIDSIT demonstrated superior performance, reducing prediction error by over 50% and achieving SoH prediction errors below 0.58% in experiments using the NASA battery degradation dataset.

Conclusion: TIDSIT is a highly accurate and generalizable solution for battery health monitoring, particularly effective for irregular time-series data, and holds potential for broader applications in health monitoring.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

### [231] [Remembering the Markov Property in Cooperative MARL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18333)
*Kale-ab Abebe Tessera,Leonard Hinckeldey,Riccardo Zamboni,David Abel,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques that the success of current cooperative MARL methods may come from learning simple conventions rather than effective signal recovery. It calls for better benchmark environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current cooperative MARL benchmarks which allow agents to succeed through brittle, co-adapted conventions rather than addressing core Dec-POMDP challenges.

Method: The paper conducts a targeted case study to analyze the behavior of co-adaptive agents and the rootedness of their policies in their observations and memories.

Result: Findings reveal that agents rely on brittle conventions that fail with non-adaptive partners. However, when task design emphasizes grounded behavior, agents can learn robust policies.

Conclusion: The study advocates for designing MARL environments that test observation-grounded behaviors and memory-based reasoning to develop robust, skillful cooperation rather than fragile conventions.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

*Etienne Zeudong,Elsa Cardoso-Bihlo,Alex Bihlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets, a physics-informed machine learning framework using low-rank adaptation to improve efficiency and accuracy of HyperDeepONets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HyperDeepONets, despite their enhanced expressivity for operator learning, face high memory and computational costs due to the large number of output parameters required.

Method: The study applies low-rank adaptation (LoRA) by decomposing the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank matrices to reduce complexity and enhance regularization.

Result: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70% reduction in parameters and consistently outperform HyperDeepONets in predictive accuracy and generalization for solving differential equations.

Conclusion: The proposed variation offers a more efficient and effective architecture for physics-informed operator learning, resolving issues tied to computational inefficiency and enhancing model performance.

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

TL;DR: The paper reviews how diffusion models, a type of AI technology, are advancing various aspects of smart agriculture, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness but facing challenges in computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With global population growth and scarce arable land, smart agriculture and precision farming require advanced AI technologies to improve efficiency and overcome challenges.

Method: The paper reviews the usage of diffusion models, highlighting advancements in crop monitoring, pest detection, remote sensing, and resource management, and compares them to GANs.

Result: Experimental results show that diffusion models enhance accuracy, robustness, and data diversity, especially in challenging agricultural environments.

Conclusion: Diffusion models have strong potential in smart agriculture, despite computational and generalization challenges, contributing to sustainable global agricultural development.

Abstract: With the global population growing and arable land resources becoming
increasingly scarce,smart agriculture and precision agriculture have emerged as
key directions for the future ofagricultural development.Artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly deep learning models, have found
widespread applications in areas such as crop monitoring and pest detection. As
an emerging generative model, diffusion models have shown significant promise
in tasks like agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote
sensing. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
diffusion models offer superior training stability and generation quality,
effectively addressing challenges such as limited agricultural data and
imbalanced image samples. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the
application of diffusion models in agriculture, focusing on their potential in
crop pest and disease detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth
prediction, and agricultural resource management. Experimental results
demonstrate that diffusion models significantly improve model accuracy and
robustness in data augmentation, image generation, and denoising, especially in
complex environments. Despite challenges related to computational efficiency
and generalization capabilities, diffusion models are expected to play an
increasingly important role in smart and precision agriculture as technology
advances, providing substantial support for the sustainable development of
global agriculture.

### [234] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HYPER, a novel method combining multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing, that enhances flood prediction, especially in data-scarce regions, while optimizing computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in achieving accurate and efficient flood prediction in areas with limited river discharge observations and data scarcity.

Method: HYPER combines Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) over 43 uncalibrated hydrological models with reservoir computing (RC) for error correction, and generalizes predictions to ungauged basins using gauged basin attributes.

Result: HYPER performed comparably to LSTM in data-rich scenarios (KGE 0.56 vs. 0.55) with 5% of computational time, and outperformed LSTM in data-scarce scenarios, maintaining a robust KGE of 0.55 vs. LSTM's -0.04.

Conclusion: HYPER offers a scalable, computationally efficient, and robust solution for hydrological prediction, outperforming other methods in ungauged and data-limited regions.

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

*Leiji Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Xin Li,Yao-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies shortcomings in the conventional bisimulation metric used for reinforcement learning and proposes a revised metric with improved methods for reward gap measurement and adaptive updates, validated theoretically and experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address imprecise reward gap definitions and reliance on static weights in bisimulation metrics which limit their effectiveness in capturing task distinctions and varying training stages in reinforcement learning.

Method: They introduce a revised bisimulation metric using adaptive coefficients and a new definition of reward gaps. The approach includes theoretical convergence guarantees and extensive experimental validation on key benchmarks.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates improved representation distinctiveness and practical performance on benchmarks such as DeepMind Control and Meta-World.

Conclusion: The paper successfully resolves key limitations of conventional bisimulation metrics, providing a theoretically grounded and experimentally validated framework for enhanced representation learning in reinforcement learning tasks.

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

*Zhongtian Sun,Anoushka Harit,Alexandra Cristea,Christl A. Donnelly,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLANCE is a framework enhancing Graph Neural Network (GNN) performance on heterophilous graphs through logic layers, attention-based pruning, and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of GNNs' poor performance on heterophilous graphs characterized by dissimilar connected nodes due to indiscriminate aggregation and lack of higher-order structure utilization.

Method: The proposed GLANCE framework includes logic-guided reasoning for interpretability, attention-based edge pruning for graph refinement, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global structural patterns.

Result: GLANCE outperformed existing methods on several benchmark datasets like Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, proving its competitiveness in handling heterophilous graphs.

Conclusion: GLANCE is a lightweight, interpretable, adaptable solution that delivers robust performance in graph learning tasks involving heterophilous data structures.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

*Magnus Bengtsson,Kenneth Östberg*

TL;DR: C2G-KD is a data-free knowledge distillation framework that trains a generator to create synthetic data using a frozen teacher model and PCA-based constraints, without real training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a knowledge distillation framework that avoids relying on real training data while maintaining topological consistency and diversity in data generation.

Method: A generator is trained to produce synthetic samples using a frozen teacher model, semantic and structural losses, and PCA-based geometric constraints derived from minimal real data for each class (as few as two examples).

Result: The proposed framework successfully generated synthetic samples with topological consistency, showing its effectiveness in experiments on MNIST with minimal class structure.

Conclusion: C2G-KD demonstrates that minimal class-specific structure is sufficient to construct useful synthetic training pipelines, offering a promising approach for data-free knowledge distillation.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [238] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal law, called the force-metric-bias (FMB) law, that unifies learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection under a common mathematical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diverse learning algorithms and biological processes appear distinct, they share underlying principles. The goal is to identify and formalize these shared principles to enhance understanding and cross-disciplinary innovation.

Method: The author reformulates the Price equation with a notational partitioning approach to introduce the FMB law, which generalizes the dynamics of parameter change using terms such as force, metric, bias, and noise.

Result: The FMB law unifies processes like natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, and optimization algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Adam) under one theoretical framework.

Conclusion: This unified framework simplifies the comparison, understanding, and development of different learning algorithms and provides insights into the natural emergence of mathematical principles like Fisher information and Kullback-Leibler divergence in learning dynamics.

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

*Jiale Chen,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes and explains the GPTQ quantization method by linking it to Babai's algorithm for solving the closest vector problem, providing both theoretical insights and error guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to better understand and improve the GPTQ method for quantizing large language models, which currently relies on algebraic updates but lacks clear geometric interpretation and theoretical guarantees.

Method: The paper establishes a mathematical equivalence between GPTQ and Babai’s nearest plane algorithm for the closest vector problem, leveraging the structure of the Hessian matrix of inputs.

Result: The analysis reveals that GPTQ gains a geometric interpretation and inherits error guarantees from Babai's algorithm under specific conditions, offering new insights into its workings.

Conclusion: By placing GPTQ on a strong theoretical foundation, this work enables the use of advanced lattice algorithms to enhance future quantization methods for large-scale language models.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new SE(2) invariant transformer architecture for spatial data processing in autonomous driving tasks, offering linear memory efficiency and improved performance over non-invariant methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatial data processing in autonomous driving tasks, by addressing the inefficiency of quadratic memory requirements in prior SE(2) invariant methods.

Method: The paper proposes a mechanism for SE(2) invariant scaled dot-product attention, employed within a transformer architecture, to achieve linear memory scaling relative to the number of scene objects.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed architecture is practical to implement and outperforms non-invariant architectures in spatial data processing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SE(2) invariant transformer architecture is effective and scalable, providing enhanced performance and practical utility for autonomous driving learning tasks.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model for de novo protein design, integrating sequence and structure information, along with a new evaluation metric called Protein-MMD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reliably generating novel and functional protein sequences using conditional diffusion models, considering proteins require integration of sequence and structure for biological functionality.

Method: A multi-level conditional diffusion model is introduced that simultaneously generates sequence-based and structure-based representations, capturing hierarchical relations between protein levels. Additionally, Protein-MMD is proposed as a metric to evaluate generated proteins’ quality and consistency.

Result: The model shows efficacy in generating high-quality proteins that meet conditional requirements, as validated by experimental results on benchmark datasets. Protein-MMD effectively captures distributional and functional similarities.

Conclusion: The framework and evaluation metric collectively advance de novo protein design, demonstrating improved reliability and quality in protein generation tasks using conditional diffusion models.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

TL;DR: This paper presents a benchmark called 'Moving Out' for studying human-AI collaboration in physically constrained environments and proposes a new method, BASS, which outperforms current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of embodied agents (like robots) in collaborating with humans by adapting to complex physical constraints and continuous dynamics in real-world environments.

Method: The authors introduced 'Moving Out,' a human-AI collaboration benchmark, designed tasks within it, and collected human interaction data. They developed a novel approach called BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection) to better model diverse behaviors and action outcomes in physical environments.

Result: The proposed BASS method demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in tasks involving both AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of addressing physical dynamics and diverse human behaviors for effective human-AI collaboration, proposing 'Moving Out' as a valuable benchmark and BASS as an effective method to tackle these challenges.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates neuromorphic computing (NMC) as a low-power, general-purpose alternative to conventional processing systems, suited for scalable and sparse algorithms rather than dense numerical operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the computational advantages and clarify the application potential of neuromorphic computing compared to conventional von Neumann architectures.

Method: The researchers compare the scaling properties (time, space, and energy) of NMC and theoretically infinite processor conventional systems, and analyze the relevance of NMC architectures for specific classes of algorithms.

Result: NMC matches conventional systems in time and space scaling but exhibits a distinct energy scaling advantage, making it better suited for sparse and scalable algorithms driven by objective functions.

Conclusion: Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling energy-efficient architectural alternative, especially for tasks requiring iterative optimization and large-scale sampling, marking a shift from traditional dense numerical workloads.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power
alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central
processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the
computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable
even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program
architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to
that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the
energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of
conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of
neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique
characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes
of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been
optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast,
the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and
sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such
as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

*Felix Arnold,Maxence Bouvier,Ryan Amaudruz,Renzo Andri,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a power-efficient design for fixed-point multipliers by decomposing them into different components, showing significant reductions in switching activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a power-efficient multiplier unit for AI workloads, where inputs are typically centered around zero.

Method: The method involves encoding operands using sign magnitude representation, performing computation in this format, and returning results to the original format, while synthesizing components independently.

Result: The approach achieves up to 12.9% switching activity reduction for a realistic input stream and up to 33% reduction for a smaller input range, with additional gains using switching-activity-driven optimizations.

Conclusion: Decomposition and power-aware synthesis ensure improved power-efficiency without impacting the logic equivalence of fixed-point multipliers.

Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point
multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder
block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude
representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute
operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows
to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the
multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two
components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to
significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly
encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis
simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching
activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved
while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall
circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly
smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to
33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on
switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10%
improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

### [246] [Contraction, Criticality, and Capacity: A Dynamical-Systems Perspective on Echo-State Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18467)
*Pradeep Singh,Lavanya Sankaranarayanan,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper unifies multiple theories to rigorously analyze Echo-State Networks (ESNs), focusing on stability, memory, and expressive power, and offers concrete design guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address fragmented understanding across disciplines regarding the stability, memory, and computational power of ESNs, inspired by neurobiological insights.

Method: It utilizes tools from functional analysis, random attractor theory, and neuroscientific insights, proving theoretical properties like fading-memory and universality and analyzing computational trade-offs using Lyapunov spectra and other metrics.

Result: Key results include proofs of fading-memory, universality with stochastic inputs, and computational resource trade-offs, alongside an understanding of dynamics at the edge of chaos in ESNs.

Conclusion: Modest-sized ESNs can rival fully trained recurrent networks due to their inherent universal and stable properties, grounded in rigorous mathematical and neurobiological principles.

Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly
recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can
transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental
questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across
disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves
together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent
neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we
prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together
with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property
(geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate
activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds,
covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a
Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with
polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of
causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to
stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via
memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute
delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the
\textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical
systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive
conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical
criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input
gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and
neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully
trained recurrent networks in practice.

### [247] [Higher-Order Behavioural Conformances via Fibrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18509)
*Henning Urbat*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper presents a categorical framework for Howe's method to uniformly address behavioural conformance in higher-order languages with probabilistic features, ensuring program congruence under general conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a general and robust categorical foundation for reasoning about program behavioural conformance, especially for quantitative features like probabilistic languages, where traditional methods are complex.

Method: Introduces abstract higher-order specifications (AHOS) for modeling operational semantics and uses fibrations to characterize behavioural conformance, culminating in a fundamental congruence theorem.

Result: Under defined categorical and operational conditions, the greatest behavioural conformance forms a congruence, verified for bisimilarity and behavioural pseudometrics in probabilistic higher-order languages.

Conclusion: The developed framework simplifies and generalizes the application of Howe's method, enabling uniform treatment of behavioural conformance and congruence in quantitative program languages.

Abstract: Coinduction is a widely used technique for establishing behavioural
equivalence of programs in higher-order languages. In recent years, the rise of
languages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions
of coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most
notably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive
reasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a
program congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the
language. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as
\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific
language and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a
uniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal
dimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled
by an \emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very
general categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of
behavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via
fibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental
congruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the
categorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an
AHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a
congruence. We illustrate our theory by deriving congruence of bisimilarity and
behavioural pseudometrics for probabilistic higher-order languages.

*Mingfeng Yuan,Letian Wang,Steven L. Waslander*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework that uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to enable robots to decode and act upon complex language-based navigation instructions in real-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigation for robots using natural language in the open world is limited by challenges in converting complex instructions into actionable tasks, especially beyond pre-set motion primitives. The authors seek to address this gap.

Method: The proposed method leverages MLLMs' cross-modal understanding and code-generation capabilities, combined with vision-language perception models, to create 2D value maps. These maps integrate semantic and spatial understanding for executing navigation tasks.

Result: The framework demonstrated zero-shot efficacy in navigating based on natural language instructions, validated through autonomous vehicle datasets and experiments with a Husky robot in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between complex language-based instructions and robotic navigation actions, proving its robustness in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

### [251] [Modular Robot and Landmark Localisation Using Relative Bearing Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18070)
*Behzad Zamani,Jochen Trumpf,Chris Manzie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular least squares filtering approach for systems with independent subsystems, especially in robot-landmark localization problems, integrating the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm to avoid information double-counting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and modularity of nonlinear least squares filtering in systems comprising independent subsystems, particularly in scenarios involving relative measurements spanning multiple subsystems.

Method: The authors introduce a modular filtering method that updates the state and error covariance for each subsystem independently. They integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm, derived from least squares estimation, ensuring no double-counting of shared information. The approach is demonstrated specifically for robot-landmark localization scenarios.

Result: The method, compared to a monolithic joint state filter in a randomized simulation, showed its respective trade-offs and advantages, including variants with graceful performance degradation under constrained communication and bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed modular filtering approach provides an effective and scalable alternative for systems like robot-landmark localization, balancing performance, modularity, and communication efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach
for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance
estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative
measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We
integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in
order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates
with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least
squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the
proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,
noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position
measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation
problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized
simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic
joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we
also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful
degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth
requirements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robust locomotion framework combining model-based and learning-based methods was developed to improve control performance and learning efficiency. It was tested successfully in real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address performance challenges in locomotion caused by model mismatches and uncertainties by integrating adaptive frameworks.

Method: They designed a modular structure combining residual modules with model-based footstep planning and dynamic modeling, utilizing model predictive control on a quadrupedal robot.

Result: The framework demonstrated robust control capabilities even under high uncertainty, improving both performance and learning efficiency.

Conclusion: The modular combination approach not only enhances locomotion but also boosts controller robustness and facilitates successful operation in uncertain real-world conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that combines the advantages of both
model-based and learning-based frameworks to achieve robust locomotion. The
residual modules are integrated with each corresponding part of the model-based
framework, a footstep planner and dynamic model designed using heuristics, to
complement performance degradation caused by a model mismatch. By utilizing a
modular structure and selecting the appropriate learning-based method for each
residual module, our framework demonstrates improved control performance in
environments with high uncertainty, while also achieving higher learning
efficiency compared to baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that our
proposed methodology not only enhances control performance but also provides
additional benefits, such as making nominal controllers more robust to
parameter tuning. To investigate the feasibility of our framework, we
demonstrated residual modules combined with model predictive control in a real
quadrupedal robot. Despite uncertainties beyond the simulation, the robot
successfully maintains balance and tracks the commanded velocity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based system for detecting, recognizing, and tracking individuals during search and rescue missions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance search and rescue operations by developing a UAV-based system capable of real-time human detection, recognition, and tracking.

Method: Integration of UAV with ROS2 framework, deployment of YOLOv11 CNN models for tracking, dlib CNN for face recognition, and PD controllers for autonomous navigation of UAV.

Result: Initial experiments with 14 individuals show successful real-time operation of the system, utilizing keypoints for tracking and maintaining safe distance.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates potential for real-time rescue operations, with plans to extend capabilities via larger UAVs and GPS-guided control in field testing.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a subsystem, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
for search and rescue missions, focusing on people detection, face recognition
and tracking of identified individuals. The proposed solution integrates a UAV
with ROS2 framework, that utilizes multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for search missions. System identification and PD controller deployment are
performed for autonomous UAV navigation. The ROS2 environment utilizes the
YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN
for face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face
recognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV
operator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and
immediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on
specific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN
model. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a
safe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is
performed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system
parameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to
estimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.
The initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that
the proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time. The next step
involves implementing the system on a large experimental UAV for field use and
integrating autonomous navigation with GPS-guided control for rescue operations
planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoRPI-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework, to enable accurate inertial-based navigation for mobile robots, achieving over 85% improvement in accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurate navigation for mobile robots in scenarios where satellite navigation or camera-based systems are unavailable, and inertial sensors alone cause drift due to noise and errors.

Method: MoRPI-PINN integrates physical laws and constraints into a neural network training process, enhancing navigation accuracy by mitigating inertial drift. The framework is designed to be lightweight and suitable for edge devices.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrated that MoRPI-PINN achieves over 85% accuracy improvement in inertial-based mobile robot navigation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN is a robust and efficient solution for drift reduction in mobile robot navigation, leveraging physics-informed neural networks for better accuracy. Its lightweight design makes it applicable for real-world mobile robot systems.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the MediaPipe facial landmark detection algorithm under controlled conditions involving a robotic arm and surgical lighting and explores its potential in medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in facial landmark detection for medical applications, such as lighting variability and flexible positioning, enabling better localization of patients.

Method: Experiment using MediaPipe algorithm under surgical lighting with a robotic arm, ensuring fixed phantom and light positions, to evaluate detection accuracy across angles.

Result: Higher accuracy observed in facial landmark detection under surgical lighting for larger yaw and pitch angles; however, increased detection dispersion in certain cases due to landmark imprecisions.

Conclusion: Integrating MediaPipe facial detection into medical procedures shows promise, though attention to mitigating detection dispersion is necessary.

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

TL;DR: ReSem3D proposes a framework for robotic manipulation in complex environments using hierarchical reasoning by integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing robotic manipulation methods, including coarse semantic granularity, absence of real-time planning, and reduced robustness in diverse environments.

Method: The framework leverages hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs combined with VFMs to construct fine-grained 3D spatial constraints from natural language and RGB-D inputs. These constraints are encoded for real-time optimization.

Result: ReSem3D demonstrates its performance in various scenarios with zero-shot learning, showing strong adaptability and generalization in manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The system effectively integrates semantic reasoning and 3D spatial constraints for robust, real-time robot manipulation across diverse environments.

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

TL;DR: AdaRPG is a framework that utilizes foundation models to enhance robots' ability to manipulate diverse articulated objects by focusing on part-level affordances and leveraging high-level control reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in manipulating articulated objects due to their unseen internal structures, geometric diversity, and functional variations.

Method: AdaRPG employs foundation models to extract part-level affordances, supported by a dedicated dataset, and uses this understanding to generate high-level control codes for adaptive manipulation.

Result: Simulations and real-world experiments validate AdaRPG's strong generalization capabilities across novel articulated object categories.

Conclusion: AdaRPG addresses key challenges in articulated object manipulation by utilizing part-based affordance understanding and leveraging foundational knowledge for adaptive control, resulting in superior robotic generalization.

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AF-RLIO, an adaptive fusion method integrating radar, LiDAR, IMU, and GPS for robust robotic navigation in challenging environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of single-sensor robotic navigation systems in complex environments like smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather.

Method: The method includes three key modules: (1) A pre-processing module uses radar to aid LiDAR in removing dynamic points and identifying degraded environments. (2) A dynamic-aware multimodal odometry employs scan-to-map matching tightly coupled with IMU via an Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. (3) A factor graph optimization module balances odometry and GPS weights for pose graph optimization.

Result: The method was tested on datasets and robotic environments, showing superior performance in challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed AF-RLIO demonstrates robustness and effectiveness for precise pose estimation and navigation in complex, dynamic environments.

Abstract: In robotic navigation, maintaining precise pose estimation and navigation in
complex and dynamic environments is crucial. However, environmental challenges
such as smoke, tunnels, and adverse weather can significantly degrade the
performance of single-sensor systems like LiDAR or GPS, compromising the
overall stability and safety of autonomous robots. To address these challenges,
we propose AF-RLIO: an adaptive fusion approach that integrates 4D
millimeter-wave radar, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and GPS to
leverage the complementary strengths of these sensors for robust odometry
estimation in complex environments. Our method consists of three key modules.
Firstly, the pre-processing module utilizes radar data to assist LiDAR in
removing dynamic points and determining when environmental conditions are
degraded for LiDAR. Secondly, the dynamic-aware multimodal odometry selects
appropriate point cloud data for scan-to-map matching and tightly couples it
with the IMU using the Iterative Error State Kalman Filter. Lastly, the factor
graph optimization module balances weights between odometry and GPS data,
constructing a pose graph for optimization. The proposed approach has been
evaluated on datasets and tested in real-world robotic environments,
demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages over existing methods in
challenging conditions such as smoke and tunnels.

TL;DR: The paper introduces G2S-ICP SLAM, a real-time RGB-D SLAM system using geometry-aware Gaussian-based representation for superior localization accuracy and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D SLAM methods using isotropic uncertainty often struggle with consistent depth interpretation and geometric fidelity in multi-view reconstruction.

Method: The proposed system implements surface-aligned Gaussian representations embedded in a Generalized ICP framework, supported by a geometry-aware loss function supervising photometric, depth, and normal consistency.

Result: Experiments on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets show that G2S-ICP SLAM surpasses existing methods in localization accuracy and reconstruction completeness, while ensuring high rendering quality.

Conclusion: The integration of a geometry-aware Gaussian representation enhances SLAM performance, providing real-time operation without compromising visual or geometric fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel geometry-aware RGB-D Gaussian Splatting
SLAM system, named G2S-ICP SLAM. The proposed method performs high-fidelity 3D
reconstruction and robust camera pose tracking in real-time by representing
each scene element using a Gaussian distribution constrained to the local
tangent plane. This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk
aligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth
interpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D
ellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this
representation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian
disks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance
prior without altering the underlying registration formulation. Furthermore we
propose a geometry-aware loss that supervises photometric, depth, and normal
consistency. Our system achieves real-time operation while preserving both
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that G2S-ICP SLAM outperforms prior SLAM systems
in terms of localization accuracy, reconstruction completeness, while
maintaining the rendering quality.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) to enhance vehicle trajectory tracking accuracy and stability, outperforming traditional methods while requiring less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vehicle modeling approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency and the ability to capture nonlinear dynamics, which limits trajectory tracking performance and driving safety.

Method: The proposed RKMPC framework combines a Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) for baseline control with a neural network-based correction term for compensation. This hybrid design leverages mechanistic models for reliability and uses residual modeling for performance optimization.

Result: Experimental results show RKMPC requires 80% less training data compared to traditional KMPC and significantly improves trajectory tracking by reducing lateral error (11.7%-22.1%), heading error (8.9%-15.8%), and enhancing front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%.

Conclusion: RKMPC achieves superior vehicle trajectory tracking performance while addressing data and model limitations, offering a practical and efficient control strategy for real-world applications.

Abstract: In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure
Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy
fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control
actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its
control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling.
Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between
capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often
resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework.
This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a
Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input
based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC
calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by
adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and
interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance
optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the
Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH
racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the
training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC)
while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC,
RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by
8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%. The

### [261] [Evaluating the Pre-Dressing Step: Unfolding Medical Garments Via Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18436)
*David Blanco-Mulero,Júlia Borràs,Carme Torras*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for unfolding folded garments using imitation learning and a visual classifier, aiming to address the gap in robotic-assisted dressing settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robotic-assisted dressing by addressing the challenge of unfolding folded garments, a critical step before dressing assistance in medical settings.

Method: The method employs imitation learning to learn three manipulation primitives for motions and a visual classifier to categorize garment states as either closed, partly opened, or fully opened.

Result: Empirical evaluation reveals that a combination of high and low acceleration motions effectively enhances the opening of folded garments, while highly dynamic motions alone are less effective.

Conclusion: The study contributes a practical pre-dressing step to existing robotic-assisted dressing frameworks, improving garment preparation efficiency in medical applications.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly aid both
patients as well as healthcare personnel, reducing the workload and improving
the efficiency in clinical settings. While substantial progress has been made
in robotic dressing assistance, prior works typically assume that garments are
already unfolded and ready for use. However, in medical applications gowns and
aprons are often stored in a folded configuration, requiring an additional
unfolding step. In this paper, we introduce the pre-dressing step, the process
of unfolding garments prior to assisted dressing. We leverage imitation
learning for learning three manipulation primitives, including both high and
low acceleration motions. In addition, we employ a visual classifier to
categorise the garment state as closed, partly opened, and fully opened. We
conduct an empirical evaluation of the learned manipulation primitives as well
as their combinations. Our results show that highly dynamic motions are not
effective for unfolding freshly unpacked garments, where the combination of
motions can efficiently enhance the opening configuration.

### [262] [A Novel Monte-Carlo Compressed Sensing and Dictionary Learning Method for the Efficient Path Planning of Remote Sensing Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18462)
*Alghalya Al-Hajri,Ejmen Al-Ubejdij,Aiman Erbad,Ali Safa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on a novel method for robotic environmental sensing using Compressed Sensing (CS), improving both travel efficiency and data accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance environmental monitoring with autonomous robots by reducing data collection efforts and robot travel distances, while maintaining or improving the quality of the reconstructed sensory data.

Method: The authors propose a Monte Carlo optimization framework that designs measurement matrices to minimize robot traversal length and signal reconstruction error, with Dictionary Learning (DL) used to improve reconstruction accuracy and minimize required samples.

Result: The proposed method achieves a reduction in robot travel distance to less than 10% of a full-coverage path and significantly improves reconstruction accuracy—over five times better compared to traditional CS methods and two times better compared to prior Informative Path Planning (IPP) methods.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel framework that optimizes both path efficiency and reconstruction accuracy, establishing significant advancements in robotic environmental data collection using CS principles.

Abstract: In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a
technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements
than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous
robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular
tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including
measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context,
this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into
how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design
optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We
propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement
matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the
signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is
the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying
transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the
number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution
maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce
robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while
improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to
traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by
a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP)
methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper compares two humanoid robot control methods—ID-WBC (task acceleration space) and PB-WBC (task force space). They are tested experimentally for robustness under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the robustness and comparative performance of two whole-body control formulations for humanoid robots in non-ideal conditions.

Method: Experimental comparison of ID-WBC and PB-WBC through tasks like swing foot control, squatting, and jumping under conditions like unmodeled disturbances and added weights.

Result: The study highlights performance differences between the two controllers, discusses their robustness, and identifies scenarios where each method excels or struggles.

Conclusion: Both control methods have specific advantages and disadvantages, and the findings help link observed behavior with their theoretical formulations.

Abstract: This paper studies the experimental comparison of two different whole-body
control formulations for humanoid robots: inverse dynamics whole-body control
(ID-WBC) and passivity-based whole-body control (PB-WBC). The two controllers
fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task
acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity
considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal
conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction,
sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact
conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the
two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and
orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights,
and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic
differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's
advantages and disadvantages.

*Vahid Garousi,Zafar Jafarov*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores how software engineers interact with AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, introducing a process model and decision framework informed by industry observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how software engineers use AI tools in daily tasks, particularly regarding trust, refinement, or rejection of AI-generated outputs.

Method: Developed a pragmatic process model and a 2D decision framework, grounded in practitioner feedback and observations from three industry settings.

Result: The models illustrate engineers' decision-making with AI tools, balancing human oversight and AI assistance.

Conclusion: Structured guidance supports effective AI use in software engineering and enhances understanding of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform Software
Engineering (SE) by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and decision support.
Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have given rise to "vibe coding"-an
exploratory, prompt-driven development style. Yet, how software engineers
engage with these tools in daily tasks, especially in deciding whether to
trust, refine, or reject AI-generated outputs, remains underexplored. This
paper presents two complementary contributions. First, a pragmatic process
model capturing real-world AI-assisted SE activities, including prompt design,
inspection, fallback, and refinement. Second, a 2D decision framework that
could help developers reason about trade-offs between effort saved and output
quality. Grounded in practitioner reports and direct observations in three
industry settings across Turkiye and Azerbaijan, our work illustrates how
engineers navigate AI use with human oversight. These models offer structured,
lightweight guidance to support more deliberate and effective use of AI tools
in SE, contributing to ongoing discussions on practical human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 11 automated tools designed to check transparency and rigor in scientific reporting, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and offers recommendations for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reproducibility crisis stems from poor standardization and transparency in scientific reporting, leading to unreliable research. Automated tools can help address this by enforcing rigor criteria.

Method: The authors compare 11 automated tools across 9 rigor criteria, analyzing their performance individually and in combination to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

Result: Certain tools excel at specific tasks, such as detecting open data, while combinations of tools outperform individual tools for other criteria like inclusion/exclusion detection. Areas for improvement were pinpointed.

Conclusion: The study provides insights and actionable recommendations for enhancing these tools and improving scientific transparency. Resources for replication are openly shared.

Abstract: The causes of the reproducibility crisis include lack of standardization and
transparency in scientific reporting. Checklists such as ARRIVE and CONSORT
seek to improve transparency, but they are not always followed by authors and
peer review often fails to identify missing items. To address these issues,
there are several automated tools that have been designed to check different
rigor criteria. We have conducted a broad comparison of 11 automated tools
across 9 different rigor criteria from the ScreenIT group. We found some
criteria, including detecting open data, where the combination of tools showed
a clear winner, a tool which performed much better than other tools. In other
cases, including detection of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the combination
of tools exceeded the performance of any one tool. We also identified key areas
where tool developers should focus their effort to make their tool maximally
useful. We conclude with a set of insights and recommendations for stakeholders
in the development of rigor and transparency detection tools. The code and data

*Xiang Echo Chen,Wenhan Zhu,Guoshuai Albert Shi,Michael W. Godfrey*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores how generative AI (GenAI) is adopted in open-source game development by analyzing GitHub issue discussions, comparing it with traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited empirical understanding of how generative AI technologies are adopted and integrated by developers in open-source game development communities.

Method: The authors constructed a dataset of open-source game repositories discussing AI-related topics. They employed open card sorting and thematic analysis on a sample of GitHub issues to label and analyze content by type and topic.

Result: The study provided a comparative analysis of GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI topics, uncovering usage patterns, developer concerns, and integration practices for each group.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into how generative AI is transforming workflows, usage, and challenges in open-source game development, distinguishing it from traditional AI and non-AI topics.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) have begun to reshape how
games are designed and developed, offering new tools for content creation,
gameplay simulation, and design ideation. While prior research has explored
traditional uses of AI in games, such as controlling agents or generating
procedural content. There is limited empirical understanding of how GenAI is
adopted by developers in real-world contexts, especially within the open-source
community. This study aims to explore how GenAI technologies are discussed,
adopted, and integrated into open-source game development by analyzing issue
discussions on GitHub. We investigate the tools, tasks, and challenges
associated with GenAI by comparing GenAI-related issues to those involving
traditional AI (TradAI) and NonAI topics. Our goal is to uncover how GenAI
differs from other approaches in terms of usage patterns, developer concerns,
and integration practices. To address this objective, we construct a dataset of
open-source game repositories that discuss AI-related topics. We apply open
card sorting and thematic analysis to a stratified sample of GitHub issues,
labelling each by type and content. These annotations enable comparative
analysis across GenAI, TradAI, and NonAI groups, and provide insight into how
GenAI is shaping the workflows and pain points of open-source game developers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help software organizations mitigate software supply chain attacks by aligning structured tasks from MITRE ATT&CK with P-SSCRM and integrating multiple frameworks.

Method: Mapping was performed using four independent strategies to ensure consistency and agreement, effectively linking tasks across MITRE ATT&CK, P-SSCRM, and other prominent frameworks.

Result: The outcome is a task mapping framework connecting MITRE ATT&CK techniques to P-SSCRM tasks and simultaneously integrating 10 other industry and government frameworks.

Conclusion: The mapping facilitates better proactive defense mechanisms against software supply chain attacks by leveraging multiple aligned frameworks.

Abstract: The MITRE Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (MITRE ATT&CK)
Attack Technique to Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework
(P-SSCRM) Task mapping described in this document helps software organizations
to determine how different tasks mitigate the attack techniques of software
supply chain attacks. The mapping was created through four independent
strategies to find agreed-upon mappings. Because each P-SSCRM task is mapped to
one or more tasks from the 10 frameworks, the mapping we provide is also a
mapping between MITRE ATT&CK and other prominent government and industry
frameworks.

### [268] [Factors Impacting Faculty Adoption of Project-Based Learning in Computing Education: a Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18039)
*Ahmad D. Suleiman,Yiming Tang,Daqing Hou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines what influences computing educators to adopt project-based learning in curricula, revealing critical barriers and enablers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors want to understand persistent issues and identify strategies for scaling the use of project-based learning in computing education.

Method: The study employs a mixed-methods approach combining surveys with quantitative statistical analysis and qualitative thematic analysis.

Result: Findings show barriers such as planning, resource limitations, and institutional deficits. Enablers include peer support, industry collaboration, and professional development.

Conclusion: For broader adoption, systemic institutional support is essential to address key barriers and enable faculty experimentation with project-based learning practices.

Abstract: This research full paper investigates the factors influencing computing
educators' adoption of project-based learning (PjBL) in software engineering
and computing curricula. Recognized as a student-centered pedagogical approach,
PjBL has the potential to enhance student motivation, engagement, critical
thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Despite these benefits,
faculty adoption remains inconsistent due to challenges such as insufficient
institutional support, time constraints, limited training opportunities,
designing or sourcing projects, and aligning them with course objectives. This
research explores these barriers and investigates the strategies and resources
that facilitate a successful adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, data
from 80 computing faculty were collected through an online survey comprising
closed-ended questions to quantify barriers, enablers, and resource needs,
along with an open-ended question to gather qualitative insights. Quantitative
data were analyzed using statistical methods, while qualitative responses
underwent thematic analysis. Results reveal that while PjBL is widely valued,
its adoption is often selective and impacted by challenges in planning and
managing the learning process, designing suitable projects, and a lack of
institutional support, such as time, funding, and teaching assistants. Faculty
are more likely to adopt or sustain PjBL when they have access to peer
collaboration, professional development, and institutional incentives. In
addition, sourcing projects from research, industry partnerships, and borrowing
from peers emerged as key facilitators for new projects. These findings
underscore the need for systemic support structures to empower faculty to
experiment with and scale PjBL practices.

*Edward Abrokwah,Taher A. Ghaleb*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates GitHub Actions workflows in open-source projects to analyze their complexity, structure, and adherence to best practices across programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GitHub Actions is a popular CI service, little is known about how open-source workflows align with its best practices. This understanding is essential to mitigate unnecessary complexity and streamline CI processes.

Method: The study uses a large dataset of GitHub Actions workflows from Java, Python, and C++ repositories. It analyzes workflow complexity, structural patterns, compliance with best practices, and cross-language variations.

Result: The research identifies both adherence to and deviation from GHA best practices, highlighting structural and complexity-related patterns in open-source CI workflows.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the need for better guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI services like GitHub Actions to promote simplicity and alignment with best practices in open-source repositories.

Abstract: Continuous Integration (CI) has evolved from a tooling strategy to a
fundamental mindset in modern CI engineering. It enables teams to develop,
test, and deliver software rapidly and collaboratively. Among CI services,
GitHub Actions (GHA) has emerged as a dominant service due to its deep
integration with GitHub and a vast ecosystem of reusable workflow actions.
Although GHA provides official documentation and community-supported best
practices, there appears to be limited empirical understanding of how
open-source real-world CI workflows align with such practices. Many workflows
might be unnecessarily complex and not aligned with the simplicity goals of CI
practices. This study will investigate the structure, complexity,
heterogeneity, and compliance of GHA workflows in open-source software
repositories. Using a large dataset of GHA workflows from Java, Python, and C++
repositories, our goal is to (a) identify workflow complexities, (b) analyze
recurring and heterogeneous structuring patterns, (c) assess compliance with
GHA best practices, and (d) uncover differences in CI pipeline design across
programming languages. Our findings are expected to reveal both areas of strong
adherence to best practices and areas for improvement where needed. These
insights will also have implications for CI services, as they will highlight
the need for clearer guidelines and comprehensive examples in CI documentation.

TL;DR: Study establishes a taxonomy for categorizing identifier name similarity in code and explores its impact on software comprehension and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poorly chosen identifier names can lead to increased cognitive load and miscommunication, especially when names resemble others in structure or functionality.

Method: Authors conducted an exploratory study and developed a taxonomy categorizing different types of identifier name similarity.

Result: The study introduced a preliminary taxonomy intended to assist in understanding and analyzing identifier name similarity.

Conclusion: The initial taxonomy provides a foundation for further research into how identifier name similarity affects comprehension, maintainability, and collaborative efforts in software projects.

Abstract: Identifier names, which comprise a significant portion of the codebase, are
the cornerstone of effective program comprehension. However, research has shown
that poorly chosen names can significantly increase cognitive load and hinder
collaboration. Even names that appear readable in isolation may lead to
misunderstandings in contexts when they closely resemble other names in either
structure or functionality. In this exploratory study, we present our
preliminary findings on the occurrence of identifier name similarity in
software projects through the development of a taxonomy that categorizes
different forms of identifier name similarity. We envision our initial taxonomy
providing researchers with a platform to analyze and evaluate the impact of
identifier name similarity on code comprehension, maintainability, and
collaboration among developers, while also allowing for further refinement and
expansion of the taxonomy.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive dataset and analysis for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) supply chain security, highlighting key challenges and recommendations for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most risk assessments for LLM-based systems narrowly focus on models or data, overlooking vulnerabilities in the broader supply chain. There is a gap in benchmarks for systematic research on LLM supply chain risks.

Method: The paper collects data on 3,859 real-world LLM applications, identifying interdependencies among 109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. It performs empirical analysis of dependencies and security risks using public vulnerability databases.

Result: The study finds deeply nested dependencies and significant vulnerabilities in the supply chain of LLM systems, with 1,555 risk-related issues identified across applications, models, datasets, and libraries.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of comprehensive supply chain security analysis for LLM systems and provides practical recommendations for researchers and developers to enhance system safety and trustworthiness.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment
of LLM-based systems across diverse domains. As these systems proliferate,
understanding the risks associated with their complex supply chains is
increasingly important. LLM-based systems are not standalone as they rely on
interconnected supply chains involving pretrained models, third-party
libraries, datasets, and infrastructure. Yet, most risk assessments narrowly
focus on model or data level, overlooking broader supply chain vulnerabilities.
While recent studies have begun to address LLM supply chain risks, there
remains a lack of benchmarks for systematic research.
  To address this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset for
analyzing and benchmarking LLM supply chain security. We collect 3,859
real-world LLM applications and perform interdependency analysis, identifying
109,211 models, 2,474 datasets, and 9,862 libraries. We extract model
fine-tuning paths, dataset reuse, and library reliance, mapping the ecosystem's
structure. To evaluate security, we gather 1,555 risk-related issues-50 for
applications, 325 for models, 18 for datasets, and 1,229 for libraries from
public vulnerability databases.
  Using this dataset, we empirically analyze component dependencies and risks.
Our findings reveal deeply nested dependencies in LLM applications and
significant vulnerabilities across the supply chain, underscoring the need for
comprehensive security analysis. We conclude with practical recommendations to
guide researchers and developers toward safer, more trustworthy LLM-enabled
systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in natural language-driven no-code development tasks. It reveals current LLMs perform poorly in these tasks, achieving a success rate of only 15.79%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the ability of LLMs to perform natural language-driven software development and feature additions based on software documentation.

Method: The authors created NoCode-bench, a dataset of 634 tasks, to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating code based on documentation updates. It includes validated test cases and a subset of high-quality human-verified tasks.

Result: Despite high token usage, the best LLM achieved only a 15.79% task success rate, with challenges in cross-file editing, understanding codebases, and calling external tools.

Conclusion: LLMs are not yet ready for fully natural language-driven no-code development, but NoCode-bench provides a foundation for future benchmarks and improvements in this area.

Abstract: Natural language-driven no-code development allows users to specify software
functionality using natural language (NL) instead of editing source code,
promising increased productivity and democratized development. Large language
models (LLMs) show potential in enabling this paradigm. In this context,
software documentation acts as an NL specification for functionality. This work
introduces NoCode-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on real-world
NL-driven feature addition tasks, consisting of 634 tasks across 10 projects
and 114k code changes. Each task pairs documentation updates with corresponding
code implementations, validated by developer-written test cases. A subset of
114 high-quality, human-verified instances, NoCode-bench Verified, ensures
reliable evaluation. Our experiments reveal that, despite high token usage, the
best LLMs achieve a task success rate of only 15.79%, highlighting challenges
in cross-file editing, codebase understanding, and tool calling. These findings
indicate that LLMs are not yet ready for fully NL-driven no-code development.
NoCode-bench lays the foundation for future advances in this area.

Method: The paper presents SMECS, a tool that extracts metadata from online repositories like GitHub and provides an interactive interface for researchers to curate and export metadata in CodeMeta format.

Result: Usability experiments confirmed that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience and assists in simplifying the metadata creation process.

Conclusion: SMECS supports the adoption of FAIR principles by simplifying and enhancing the efficiency of creating metadata for research software.

Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in adopting the FAIR principles for research
software and enables findability and reusability. However, creating
high-quality metadata can be resource-intensive for researchers and research
software engineers. To address this challenge, we developed the Software
Metadata Extraction and Curation Software (SMECS) which integrates the
extraction of metadata from existing sources together with a user-friendly
interface for metadata curation. SMECS extracts metadata from online
repositories such as GitHub and presents it to researchers through an
interactive interface for further curation and export as a CodeMeta file. The
usability of SMECS was evaluated through usability experiments which confirmed
that SMECS provides a satisfactory user experience. SMECS supports the
FAIRification of research software by simplifying metadata creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and accelerate the development and testing processes for ADAS systems, ensuring regulatory compliance and shorter cycles.

Method: Leveraging LLMs and RAG for requirements summarization, simulation code, hardware-specific implementations, and regulation-based test generation using MDE.

Result: The approach produces consistent requirements, generates both simulation and hardware-specific code, and accelerates compliance and development cycles.

Conclusion: By integrating GenAI and MDE techniques, the proposed method significantly enhances efficiency and reduces development complexity for autonomous driving software.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of EAIR system bugs, which hampers the development of debugging practices for reliable EAIR system deployment.

Method: A systematic study of 885 bugs from 80 EAIR system projects, classifying bugs based on symptoms, underlying causes, and affected modules, followed by constructing mappings to guide diagnostics.

Result: The paper identifies 15 symptoms, 18 causes, and 13 modules affected by EAIR system bugs, revealing 8 EAIR-specific symptoms and 8 EAIR-specific causes primarily related to AI-agent reasoning and decision-making.

Conclusion: The study offers insights to improve bug diagnostics and repair, enabling researchers to focus on modules prone to specific types of bugs and advancing EAIR system reliability.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence Robots (EAIR) is an emerging and rapidly
evolving technological domain. Ensuring their program correctness is
fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth
understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the
development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs.
  To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR
system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their
symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes
considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15
distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new
interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research
on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified
symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is
characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards.
Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the
majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and
decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction,
detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and
the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to
focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.

### [276] [Scheduzz: Constraint-based Fuzz Driver Generation with Dual Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18289)
*Yan Li,Wenzhang Yang,Yuekun Wang,Jian Gao,Shaohua Wang,Yinxing Xue,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique, improves automated fuzz driver generation by leveraging LLMs to understand library usage and implementing a resource-efficient scheduling system. It outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in coverage and bug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic library fuzzing techniques generate irrational drivers and waste resources because they fail to adhere to proper library usage conventions and lack efficient execution scheduling.

Method: Scheduzz uses LLMs to understand library usage and derive API combination constraints. It implements a dual scheduling framework to select and execute efficient fuzz drivers while treating the problem as an online optimization challenge.

Result: Scheduzz was tested on 33 real-world libraries, yielding significantly higher coverage (1.62x to 1.89x) than other approaches and uncovering 33 new bugs, including 3 CVEs.

Conclusion: Scheduzz demonstrates that combining LLM-based API understanding with dual scheduling optimizes library fuzzing, leading to better resource utilization, coverage, and bug discovery.

Abstract: Fuzzing a library requires experts to understand the library usage well and
craft high-quality fuzz drivers, which is tricky and tedious. Therefore, many
techniques have been proposed to automatically generate fuzz drivers. However,
they fail to generate rational fuzz drivers due to the lack of adherence to
proper library usage conventions, such as ensuring a resource is closed after
being opened. To make things worse, existing library fuzzing techniques
unconditionally execute each driver, resulting in numerous irrational drivers
that waste computational resources while contributing little coverage and
generating false positive bug reports.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel automatic library fuzzing
technique, Scheduzz, an LLM-based library fuzzing technique. It leverages LLMs
to understand rational usage of libraries and extract API combination
constraints. To optimize computational resource utilization, a dual scheduling
framework is implemented to efficiently manage API combinations and fuzz
drivers. The framework models driver generation and the corresponding fuzzing
campaign as an online optimization problem. Within the scheduling loop,
multiple API combinations are selected to generate fuzz drivers, while
simultaneously, various optimized fuzz drivers are scheduled for execution or
suspension.
  We implemented Scheduzz and evaluated it in 33 real-world libraries. Compared
to baseline approaches, Scheduzz significantly reduces computational overhead
and outperforms UTopia on 16 out of 21 libraries. It achieves 1.62x, 1.50x, and
1.89x higher overall coverage than the state-of-the-art techniques CKGFuzzer,
Promptfuzz, and the handcrafted project OSS-Fuzz, respectively. In addition,
Scheduzz discovered 33 previously unknown bugs in these well-tested libraries,
3 of which have been assigned CVEs.

### [277] [YATE: The Role of Test Repair in LLM-Based Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18316)
*Michael Konstantinou,Renzo Degiovanni,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Mike Papadakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces YATE, a method combining rule-based static analysis and re-prompting to fix incorrect unit tests generated by language models, improving both line and branch coverage, as well as mutant killing effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models generate incorrect unit tests, which are often discarded despite their potential value when fixed. Enhancing these tests could improve program logic testing and serve as seeds for further test generation.

Method: YATE employs rule-based static analysis coupled with re-prompting to repair syntactically and semantically incorrect tests produced by language models, comparing its efficacy to four other LLM-based methods.

Result: YATE outperforms existing methods, achieving 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage, and killing 20% more mutants while maintaining a comparable cost in LLM calls.

Conclusion: The technique effectively transforms incorrect tests into valuable additions to the testing suite, significantly enhancing coverage and reliability compared to plain LLM-based methods and alternatives.

Abstract: Recent advances in automated test generation utilises language models to
produce unit tests. While effective, language models tend to generate many
incorrect tests with respect to both syntax and semantics. Although such
incorrect tests can be easily detected and discarded, they constitute a "missed
opportunity" -- if fixed, they are often valuable as they directly add testing
value (they effectively target the underlying program logic to be tested) and
indirectly form good seeds for generating additional tests. To this end, we
propose a simple technique for repairing some of these incorrect tests through
a combination of rule-based static analysis and re-prompting. We evaluate this
simple approach, named YATE, on a set of 6 open-source projects and show that
it can effectively produce tests that cover on average 32.06% more lines and
kill 21.77% more mutants than a plain LLM-based method. We also compare YATE
with four other LLM-based methods, namely HITS, SYMPROMPT, TESTSPARK and
COVERUP and show that it produces tests that cover substantially more code.
YATE achieves 22% higher line coverage, 20% higher branch coverage and kill 20%
more mutants at a comparable cost (number of calls to LLMs).

### [278] [Gotta catch 'em all! Towards File Localisation from Issues at Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18319)
*Jesse Maarleveld,Jiapan Guo,Daniel Feitosa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper focuses on developing a dataset for issue file localisation without specific selection of issue types, evaluating traditional methods, and investigating biases from bug localisation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create methods for file localisation that work across all types of issues, addressing gaps in current research that concentrates mainly on bugs or selected issue types.

Method: This study develops a flexible data pipeline to create comprehensive issue file localisation datasets, tests baseline methods, and conducts statistical analysis on biases affecting performance.

Result: Bug-specific file localisation heuristics fail on general issue datasets; small but significant variations exist among issue types; identifiers slightly impact performance, with project-specific distinctions.

Conclusion: General-purpose file localisation methods are needed, as results suggest current models tailored for bugs are inadequate. Customised approaches for different projects are encouraged.

Abstract: Bug localisation, the study of developing methods to localise the files
requiring changes to resolve bugs, has been researched for a long time to
develop methods capable of saving developers' time. Recently, researchers are
starting to consider issues outside of bugs. Nevertheless, most existing
research into file localisation from issues focusses on bugs or uses other
selection methods to ensure only certain types of issues are considered as part
of the focus of the work. Our goal is to work on all issues at large, without
any specific selection.
  In this work, we provide a data pipeline for the creation of issue file
localisation datasets, capable of dealing with arbitrary branching and merging
practices. We provide a baseline performance evaluation for the file
localisation problem using traditional information retrieval approaches.
Finally, we use statistical analysis to investigate the influence of biases
known in the bug localisation community on our dataset.
  Our results show that methods designed using bug-specific heuristics perform
poorly on general issue types, indicating a need for research into general
purpose models. Furthermore, we find that there are small, but statistically
significant differences in performance between different issue types. Finally,
we find that the presence of identifiers have a small effect on performance for
most issue types. Many results are project-dependent, encouraging the
development of methods which can be tuned to project-specific characteristics.

### [279] [FMI Meets SystemC: A Framework for Cross-Tool Virtual Prototyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18339)
*Nils Bosbach,Meik Schmidt,Lukas Jünger,Matthias Berthold,Rainer Leupers*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for integrating SystemC-based Virtual Platforms with FMI for improved co-simulation and software testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern systems require thorough testing and prototyping using multiple tools, but SystemC lacks FMI support, limiting integration for co-simulation.

Method: A framework is developed to connect SystemC-based VPs with external tools via FMI, enabling realistic environmental input simulation.

Result: A case study shows a simulated temperature sensor receiving environmental data from external tools, facilitating realistic software testing.

Conclusion: The framework enables earlier certification processes like ISO 26262 by allowing pre-testing of software using Virtual Platforms before hardware availability.

Abstract: As systems become more complex, the demand for thorough testing and virtual
prototyping grows. To simulate whole systems, multiple tools are usually needed
to cover different parts. These parts include the hardware of a system and the
environment with which the system interacts. The Functional Mock-up Interface
(FMI) standard for co-simulation can be used to connect these tools.
  The control part of modern systems is usually a computing unit, such as a
System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Microcontroller Unit (MCU), which executes software
from a connected memory and interacts with peripherals. To develop software
without requiring access to physical hardware, full-system simulators, the
so-called Virtual Platforms (VPs), are commonly used. The IEEE-standardized
framework for VP development is SystemC TLM. SystemC provides interfaces and
concepts that enable modular design and model exchange. However, SystemC lacks
native FMI support, which limits the integration into broader co-simulation
environments.
  This paper presents a novel framework to control and interact with
SystemC-based VPs using the FMI. We present a case study showing how a
simulated temperature sensor in a SystemC simulation can obtain temperature
values from an external tool via FMI. This approach allows the unmodified
target software to run on the VP and receive realistic environmental input data
such as temperature, velocity, or acceleration values from other tools. Thus,
extensive software testing and verification is enabled. By having tests ready
and the software pre-tested using a VP once the physical hardware is available,
certifications like ISO 26262 can be done earlier.

### [280] [Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476)
*Busra Icoz,Goksel Biricik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning and large language models (LLMs) to improve automated code review processes. Testing on the CodexGlue dataset demonstrated its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code review is subjective and time-intensive, and AI-driven automation has limitations, especially in logical reasoning. Integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs aims to address these challenges.

Method: The study uses a hybrid approach that combines symbolic reasoning with LLMs, testing on the CodexGlue dataset with models like CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT to evaluate performance.

Result: The proposed approach showed improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of automated code reviews when compared to other models.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning techniques with LLMs offers a promising solution to augment the capabilities of automated code review systems, making them more effective.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

### [281] [A Deep Dive into Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Code Completion: Experience on WeChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18515)
*Zezhou Yang,Ting Peng,Cuiyun Gao,Chaozheng Wang,Hailiang Huang,Yuetang Deng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for code completion in an industrial-scale closed-source codebase, finding similarity-based RAG with advanced retrieval techniques achieves the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for code completion and the challenges posed by distribution shifts between open-source and closed-source codebases, which existing RAG research has not addressed.

Method: The authors conducted an empirical study comparing identifier-based and similarity-based RAG methods across 26 LLMs of varying sizes on WeChat's codebase, supplemented with different retrieval techniques, including lexical (BM25) and semantic (GTE-Qwen) methods.

Result: The study found that similarity-based RAG outperformed identifier-based RAG in the closed-source environment. Advanced retrieval techniques, like BM25 and GTE-Qwen, further enhanced performance, and their combination yielded the best results. These findings were validated with a developer survey.

Conclusion: Similarity-based RAG, especially with advanced retrieval techniques and their combination, is highly effective for code completion in closed-source repositories, demonstrating its practicality for real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: Code completion, a crucial task in software engineering that enhances
developer productivity, has seen substantial improvements with the rapid
advancement of large language models (LLMs). In recent years,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising method to
enhance the code completion capabilities of LLMs, which leverages relevant
context from codebases without requiring model retraining. While existing
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG on public repositories and
benchmarks, the potential distribution shift between open-source and
closed-source codebases presents unique challenges that remain unexplored. To
mitigate the gap, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the performance
of widely-used RAG methods for code completion in the industrial-scale codebase
of WeChat, one of the largest proprietary software systems. Specifically, we
extensively explore two main types of RAG methods, namely identifier-based RAG
and similarity-based RAG, across 26 open-source LLMs ranging from 0.5B to 671B
parameters. For a more comprehensive analysis, we employ different retrieval
techniques for similarity-based RAG, including lexical and semantic retrieval.
Based on 1,669 internal repositories, we achieve several key findings: (1) both
RAG methods demonstrate effectiveness in closed-source repositories, with
similarity-based RAG showing superior performance, (2) the effectiveness of
similarity-based RAG improves with more advanced retrieval techniques, where
BM25 (lexical retrieval) and GTE-Qwen (semantic retrieval) achieve superior
performance, and (3) the combination of lexical and semantic retrieval
techniques yields optimal results, demonstrating complementary strengths.
Furthermore, we conduct a developer survey to validate the practical utility of
RAG methods in real-world development environments.

*Semih Eren,Deniz Kucukahmetler,Nico Scherf*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel multimodal recurrent model capable of predicting cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli by integrating video, audio, and language inputs to achieve promising benchmarks in a competitive setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model that can accurately predict cortical responses to complex and naturalistic stimuli by combining visual, auditory, and semantic modalities over time.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained embeddings (video, audio, and language) to fMRI time series. This design features bidirectional RNNs for modality-specific dynamics, a fusion mechanism, and subject-specific output heads. The training uses a composite loss and a curriculum learning strategy to emphasize different brain regions gradually.

Result: The proposed system scored third in the Algonauts competition with a Pearson correlation of 0.2094, including the highest single-parcel performance (mean r = 0.63). It performed especially well for the most challenging subject (Subject 5).

Conclusion: The research provides a robust and extensible benchmark method for multimodal brain-encoding and demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of integrating temporal dynamics from multiple modalities for neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future
multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Motivation: Investigating how to perform effective CCA analysis in a streaming data context to identify correlated features in real-time, especially for high-dimensional datasets.

Method: Extends CCA into an online setting with a sliding window approach, leverages a streaming PCA algorithm for backend processing to estimate CCA components in real-time.

Result: Numerical simulations were conducted to characterize performance, and theoretical guarantees are provided. SWICCA is shown to scale to extremely high-dimensional data and demonstrated with real-world data.

Conclusion: SWICCA is a scalable and effective method for online, real-time CCA in high-dimensional, streaming data applications, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated
sets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
extension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window
Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a
streaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses
these outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the
CCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide
numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a
theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable
to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that
demonstrates this capability.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new two-armed bandit framework to enhance A/B testing by using a three-step process involving doubly robust estimation, bandit framework-created test statistics, and permutation-based p-value computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B testing is crucial for policy evaluation and product deployment, but current methods can be improved in terms of statistical power.

Method: The method involves three steps: (i) generation of pseudo-outcomes using doubly robust estimation, (ii) construction of the test statistic within a two-armed bandit framework, and (iii) calculation of p-values using a permutation-based approach.

Result: Using asymptotic theories, numerical simulations, and real-world data from a ridesharing company, the proposed approach demonstrated superior efficacy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed two-armed bandit framework improves A/B testing power, offering a more effective analytical approach for technology companies.

Abstract: A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing
methods.

*Stefan Klus,Jason J. Bramburger*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores how stochastic processes in signals relate to random walks on graphons, proposing methods to estimate transfer operators and perform clustering using eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance the understanding and analysis of stochastic signals by drawing parallels to random walks on graphons, a less explored infinite-dimensional representation of graph structures.

Method: Transfer operators like Koopman and Perron-Frobenius are introduced; these are estimated from signal data for eigenanalysis, clustering, and reconstruction of graphons and transition densities.

Result: The proposed methods are effective for clustering and reconstructing signal-based stochastic processes, demonstrated through applications on synthetic and real-world data such as temperature records and stock indices.

Conclusion: The study extends spectral clustering techniques to graphons, providing a novel approach for analyzing stochastic signals in various fields.

Abstract: Many signals evolve in time as a stochastic process, randomly switching
between states over discretely sampled time points. Here we make an explicit
link between the underlying stochastic process of a signal that can take on a
bounded continuum of values and a random walk process on a graphon. Graphons
are infinite-dimensional objects that represent the limit of convergent
sequences of graphs whose size tends to infinity. We introduce transfer
operators, such as the Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators, associated with
random walk processes on graphons and then illustrate how these operators can
be estimated from signal data and how their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can
be used for detecting clusters, thereby extending conventional spectral
clustering methods from graphs to graphons. Furthermore, we show that it is
also possible to reconstruct transition probability densities and, if the
random walk process is reversible, the graphon itself using only the signal.
The resulting data-driven methods are applied to a variety of synthetic and
real-world signals, including daily average temperatures and stock index
values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address security risks in machine learning models caused by training data reconstruction attacks.

Method: The authors propose a mathematical framework, utilize maximum mean discrepancy equivalence, and develop a score matching framework for reconstructing data in Bayesian and non-Bayesian models.

Result: The study offers insights into vulnerable features in training data and provides reconstruction methods for Bayesian and non-Bayesian models.

Conclusion: Modern machine learning methods are susceptible to training data reconstruction attacks, and effective mathematical and analytical approaches can significantly mitigate risks.

Abstract: Publicly releasing the specification of a model with its trained parameters
means an adversary can attempt to reconstruct information about the training
data via training data reconstruction attacks, a major vulnerability of modern
machine learning methods. This paper makes three primary contributions:
establishing a mathematical framework to express the problem, characterising
the features of the training data that are vulnerable via a maximum mean
discrepancy equivalance and outlining a score matching framework for
reconstructing data in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, the former is a
first in the literature.

*Miguel Aspis,Sebastián A. Cajas Ordónez,Andrés L. Suárez-Cetrulo,Ricardo Simón Carbajo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents DriftMoE, an adaptive online Mixture-of-Experts model for concept drift in data streams with better specialization and resource efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adaptive ensemble methods in non-stationary data streams suffer from coarse adaptation mechanisms and inefficient knowledge utilization, necessitating a more specialized and efficient approach.

Method: DriftMoE employs a co-training framework combining a neural router with Hoeffding tree experts. The router dynamically assigns tasks to experts while updating itself and experts through a symbiotic feedback loop for specialized learning.

Result: DriftMoE performs competitively with state-of-the-art adaptive ensemble models across nine benchmark datasets, handling abrupt, gradual, and real-world concept drifts effectively.

Conclusion: DriftMoE introduces a specialized and resource-efficient adaptive mechanism for handling concept drift, validated by its performance across various benchmarks. Code and resources are made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive
ensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift
adaptation. All code, data pipelines, and reproducibility scripts are available
in our public GitHub repository: https://github.com/miguel-ceadar/drift-moe.

*Keyi Li,Yuval Kluger,Boris Landa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops a method to estimate noise magnitudes and correct pairwise Euclidean distances affected by heteroskedastic noise, offering theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pairwise Euclidean distance is distorted in real-world applications due to heteroskedastic noise, which disrupts data geometry and accuracy in machine learning tasks.

Method: The paper introduces a principled, hyperparameter-free approach to jointly estimate noise magnitudes and correct distorted distances, supported by theoretical bounds on estimation errors.

Result: The proposed approach showed success in synthetic data experiments and improved computations in real-world scenarios like single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Conclusion: The method reliably corrects distances under noise, enhancing the robustness of algorithms dependent on accurate distance measures.

Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to explore how automated systems, such as TxGraffiti, can contribute to mathematical discovery and spark curiosity among mathematicians and AI researchers.

Method: The conjectures were generated by the TxGraffiti system using symbolic pattern recognition and heuristic-defined processes, validated empirically across hundreds of graphs, and refined through human-augmented dialogues.

Result: The generated conjectures are concise, grounded in natural graph invariants, and remain unresolved despite exhaustive efforts to prove or disprove them.

Conclusion: The conjectures serve as a call to action for both humans and AI to engage with and reflect on the role of machines in advancing mathematical thought and creativity.

Abstract: We present four open conjectures in graph theory generated by the automated

in natural graph invariants, and empirically validated across hundreds of
graphs. Despite extensive effort, these statements remain unresolved--defying
both proof and counterexample. They are not only mathematical challenges but
creative expressions--born of symbolic pattern recognition and
mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and
now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures
invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke
wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By
highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI
systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it
means when machines participate meaningfully in the creative process of
mathematical thought.

### [291] [Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-π): A physics-data hybrid-driven approach for discovering dimensionless parameter combinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18332)
*Mingkun Xia,Haitao Lin,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper presents Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-π), a method combining dimensional analysis and symbolic regression to identify key dimensionless parameters in high-dimensional systems, applied successfully to cases in fluid mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the application of dimensional analysis to high-dimensional systems by eliminating redundant dimensionless parameters and achieving more meaningful physical descriptions.

Method: The Hi-π method integrates dimensional analysis with symbolic regression, employing a physics-data hybrid-driven approach to automatically identify critical dimensionless parameters.

Result: The method was tested on several fluid mechanics examples, accurately extracting key dimensionless parameters such as the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, Reynolds number, relative roughness, and compressibility correction formulations.

Conclusion: Hi-π demonstrates a powerful capability to uncover intrinsic physical laws and dimensional hierarchies, balancing accuracy and complexity, and is validated across diverse multiscale fluid mechanics systems.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into a Digital Twin (DT) framework to enable efficient bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations, demonstrated through a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transitioning Digital Twins from academia to industry is hindered due to a lack of standardized frameworks, highlighting the need for improved knowledge transfer in DT lifecycle management.

Method: The study integrates a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an existing DT framework, supported by data pipelines connecting the module to a historical repository and simulation model.

Result: The proposed integration successfully manages sim-to-real and real-to-sim knowledge transfer without sacrificing efficiency, demonstrated in a case study on a pedestrian bridge.

Conclusion: Improving knowledge transfer via an RGA module and data pipelines enhances the functionality and lifecycle management of Digital Twins, bridging the gap between academic concepts and industrial applications.

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

*Andrew Jeyathasan,Swati Banerjee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores multisensory integration (MSI), emphasizing the complexity of interactions between more than two sensory modalities and proposing design factors for effective MSI studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of multisensory integration, especially when involving three or more sensory modalities, as these scenarios are relatively underexplored compared to unimodal or bimodal studies.

Method: The authors analyze critical factors influencing MSI studies such as cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive load, and stimulus timing, while applying these insights to design study protocols.

Result: The paper provides insights into the challenges and considerations involved in studying MSI with multiple modalities, contributing guidelines for effectively designing research in this domain.

Conclusion: Multisensory integration involving multiple modalities is a complex area requiring structured and carefully designed study protocols that account for nuanced variables like timing and cognitive load.

Abstract: We experience the world through multiple senses that work together to create
a cohesive perception, whether in daily life or immersive technologies.
Understanding this multisensory integration (MSI) requires examining the
interactions between sensory modalities, each with unique temporal dynamics and
characteristics. While most research focuses on unimodal or bimodal cues, the
integration of three or more modalities remains underexplored. MSI studies must
account for factors like cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive
load, and stimulus timing, which become increasingly complex as modalities
multiply. This article examines these key factors and how they can be applied
to 8 design effective MSI study protocols.

### [294] [Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17943)
*Shu-Yuan Liu,Johan Engström,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient algorithm to estimate brake onset in automated driving systems (ADS) by using vehicle longitudinal time-series data, bypassing the need for vehicle control signal availability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to assess response timing in ADS and human drivers during collision avoidance scenarios. Traditional methods relying on vehicle control signals or manual annotation are inadequate for large-scale datasets, particularly with ADS log data that observe road users via onboard sensors.

Method: The authors developed an algorithm using a piecewise linear acceleration model to estimate brake onset. They also proposed a manual annotation method as ground truth for validation and used R2 as a confidence metric to evaluate the algorithm's accuracy.

Result: The algorithm, validated using naturalistic collision avoidance data from both ADS and human drivers, demonstrated accuracy and robustness against manual annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, generalizable, and applicable to various road user and scenario types, though it has certain limitations.

Abstract: Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated
driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not
limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver
response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human
driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and
a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual
annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal
movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data
where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for
the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding
road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques
for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are
not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a
piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that
can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal
time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake
onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence
metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification
performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both
ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.
Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,
generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly
configurable.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of different communication strategies among dual Large Language Model agents in a mathematical problem-solving environment, finding peer-to-peer collaboration to be the most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how communication strategies among AI agents impact their problem-solving efficiency in an educational setting.

Method: The study used four communication modes—teacher-student interaction, peer-to-peer collaboration, reciprocal peer teaching, and critical debate—in a dual-agent mathematical problem-solving environment powered by the OpenAI GPT-4o model.

Result: The dual-agent setups outperformed single agents, with peer-to-peer collaboration achieving the highest accuracy in problem-solving on the MATH dataset.

Conclusion: Dual-agent frameworks improve computational tasks, and effective communication strategies are central to addressing complex problems in AI-aided education.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

Result: Demonstrates how AI tools can actively contribute to ideation, conceptualization, and decision-making in design.

Conclusion: AI's integration as a creative agent in design processes necessitates a rethinking of traditional human-centered design workflows.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve from a back-end
computational tool into an interactive, generative collaborator, its
integration into early-stage design processes demands a rethinking of
traditional workflows in human-centered design. This paper explores the
emergent paradigm of human-AI co-creation, where AI is not merely used for
automation or efficiency gains, but actively participates in ideation, visual

large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as
Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles
of proposal, critique, and revision.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study analyzes over 140,000 teacher-AI interactions from a generative AI platform by employing a human-AI collaborative methodology, revealing key educator goals and the advanced qualitative coding performance of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how educators practically use generative AI tools in instruction and teacher reflection, as well as develop scalable methods to study these interactions at scale.

Method: A four-phase coding pipeline combining inductive theme discovery, codebook development, annotation, and model benchmarking, applied to analyze 140,000 educator-AI messages using a hierarchical codebook based on teacher evaluation frameworks.

Result: LLMs, especially Claude 3.5 Haiku, showed reliability in theme discovery and outperformed open-weight models in coding tasks. Teachers used AI for goals like instructional enhancement (79.7%), content adaptation (76.1%), and tailored instruction for students (43.3%).

Conclusion: Generative AI can significantly support teacher practices, and the collaborative methodology offers a scalable, effective model for qualitative research into AI's role in education.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

TL;DR: PosterMate is an AI-driven poster design assistant using persona agents, facilitating collaborative feedback and edits on poster designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of gathering audience feedback for poster design are challenging due to coordination issues and diverse perspectives.

Method: PosterMate simulates feedback via persona agents created from marketing documents, moderates discussions among them, and suggests synthesized design edits.

Result: PosterMate was found effective in capturing overlooked viewpoints and providing persona-relevant feedback in two studies with 112 participants.

Conclusion: PosterMate enhances poster design by simulating human-like feedback processes, improving collaboration and design iteration efficiency.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

Conclusion: This scalable and interpretable framework advances cognitive modeling, offering potential applications in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and educational analytics.

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for visualizing multi-dimensional data face issues like occlusion and lack computational efficiency for lossless high-dimensional representation.

Method: The authors present a framework based on Concentric Coordinates, a generalization of Parallel and Circular Coordinates, enabling effective and interpretable visualization.

Conclusion: Using Concentric Coordinates improves upon traditional approaches by addressing occlusion and enhancing computational capabilities in data visualization.

Abstract: The visualization of multi-dimensional data with interpretable methods
remains limited by capabilities for both high-dimensional lossless

*Zeqiang Zhang,Ruxin Chen*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: This paper explores the conflict between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and economic equilibrium theory, addressing discrepancies through a modified Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional economic models assume agents act passively under equilibrium theory, but RL agents often behave as manipulators, deviating from equilibrium outcomes.

Method: The authors introduce a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that adjusts the cost function and embeds agents in a fixed macroeconomic field to align behavior with competitive equilibrium.

Result: The proposed framework successfully addresses RL's conflicts with economic modeling, demonstrating convergence to policies consistent with competitive equilibrium.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical and theoretically sound method for integrating learning agents into economic modeling while preserving equilibrium assumptions.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces can reveal the relationships and encoded linguistic properties, but exploring these spaces manually demands significant effort.

Method: The authors propose a framework with an organized taxonomy for mapper graph elements and customizable LLM-based agents that apply perturbation for scalable and automated analysis within a visual analytics workspace.

Result: The framework enabled replication of prior findings on BERT's embeddings and revealed new observations about linguistic properties in topological neighborhoods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the exploration of LLM embeddings by automating annotation processes and enabling insights into linguistic properties.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

*Liyuan Chen,Shuoling Liu,Jiangpeng Yan,Xiaoyu Wang,Henglin Liu,Chuang Li,Kecheng Jiao,Jixuan Ying,Yang Veronica Liu,Qiang Yang,Xiu Li*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: This paper surveys Financial Foundation Models (FFMs), categorizing them into FinLFMs, FinTSFMs, and FinVLFMs, while addressing challenges and future opportunities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of general-purpose foundation models like GPT-4 highlights both their potential and limitations in addressing unique financial domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning and regulatory compliance.

Method: The authors provide a taxonomy for FFMs, reviewing their architectures, training processes, datasets, and applications in three modalities. They also identify key challenges and propose directions for future research.

Result: The paper categorizes FFMs into three types and provides an in-depth analysis of their design, training, and applications. It also highlights gaps in data, scalability, and infrastructure for FFMs.

Conclusion: This work offers an extensive reference for understanding and innovating in the FFM space, with additional resources available online.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with
strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial
engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have
demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report
summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications
remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,
regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related
publications and resources will be maintained on our website

*Rodrigo Moreira,Larissa F. Rodrigues Moreira,Flávio de Oliveira Silva*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates DDoS impacts on 5G core network functions and explores resource management and monitoring strategies for efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in resource provisioning and DDoS impact on 5G core network functions.

Method: Analyzes effects of DDoS workloads and evaluates kernel-based packet monitoring for resource and threat management.

Result: Chaotic workloads impact User Equipment registration performance, and monitoring methods indicate the importance of resource diversity and scalable defense strategies.

Conclusion: Diverse resource profiles and kernel-based monitoring enhance SLA compliance and threat defense in 5G core deployments.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents
significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent
resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on
analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using
mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This
paper elucidates the effects of chaotic workloads, generated by Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) on different Network Functions (NFs) on User Equipment
registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in
large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture
approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable
security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights
into the effective deployment of 5G NFs in complex scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RECALLED, a method for exploiting visual inputs to conduct Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) on large vision-language models, revealing significant vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to RCAs through visual inputs, yet existing defenses lack adequate strategies to mitigate such attacks.

Method: The paper employs Vision Guided Optimization to generate adversarial perturbations in visual data and Multi-Objective Parallel Losses to enable universal templates for parallel attacks.

Result: RECALLED significantly increases service response latency (26%) and GPU/memory consumption (20%) while exposing security vulnerabilities in LVLMs.

Conclusion: RECALLED effectively demonstrates the potential for RCAs in LVLMs via visual inputs, necessitating improved defensive frameworks.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cybersecurity risks posed by phishing emails and improve ML model performance by creating a high-quality, diverse phishing email dataset.

Method: The authors created a phishing email dataset called MeAJOR by merging samples from multiple sources, integrating diverse phishing and legitimate tactics and testing its utility using four ML models.

Result: The dataset demonstrated high efficacy, achieving a 98.34% F1 score with the XGB model, and addressed issues like class imbalance and generalisability.

Conclusion: MeAJOR represents a valuable reusable resource for phishing email detection, enhancing detection capabilities and overcoming common ML challenges.

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by
exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious
payloads. While Machine Learning (ML) models are effective at detecting
phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity
of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from
Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email
dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It
integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and
legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated
the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic
experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple
categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while
addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and
reproducibility.

### [310] [LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302)
*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reveals that Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning in language models (LMs) is susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs), despite common assumptions of reduced risk. They provide an evaluation framework (LoRA-Leak) for assessing privacy risks, introduce improved attack methods, and suggest mitigations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked privacy risks associated with the fine-tuning of language models using LoRA, particularly due to the use of pre-trained models that increase susceptibility to membership inference attacks (MIAs).

Method: The authors developed LoRA-Leak, a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines existing and enhanced MIAs to study how LoRA fine-tuning impacts privacy. They tested their framework on three LMs using various NLP tasks and explored defensive strategies.

Result: LoRA-Leak demonstrates that LoRA fine-tuned LMs exhibit vulnerability to MIAs, with high attack success rates under certain settings (e.g., 0.775 AUC). Among defenses, dropout and excluding specific layers during fine-tuning were found effective for mitigating risks without significant utility loss.

Conclusion: LoRA-based fine-tuning introduces heightened privacy risks due to the reliance on pre-trained models, making existing membership inference threats more impactful. The study offers insights into protective measures and raises awareness for specialized LM providers to prioritize privacy considerations.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

### [311] [Information Security Based on LLM Approaches: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18215)
*Chang Gong,Zhongwen Li,Xiaoqi Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance various aspects of information security, but challenges remain such as transparency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional information security methods struggle to handle evolving, complex threats, motivating the exploration of LLMs for more intelligent and adaptable solutions.

Method: The paper reviews the application of LLMs in areas like malicious behavior prediction and vulnerability detection, examines their technical foundation in neural networks and Transformers, and evaluates their performance improvement in security tasks.

Result: The use of LLMs enhances detection accuracy and reduces false alarm rates in security systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in natural language processing-related security tasks.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise in information security, further work is required to address issues like transparency, interpretability, and adaptability to fully realize their potential.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

### [312] [NWaaS: Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service for X-to-Image DNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18036)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Yu Guo,Hangcheng Cao,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel trustless paradigm for watermarking called Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service (NWaaS) and its implementation, ShadowMark, which embeds watermarks into model outputs without modifying parameters or structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intrusive nature of existing DNN watermarking methods, which modify model parameters or structure, causing shifts in behavior, additional costs, and limiting practical adoption in Watermarking as a Service systems.

Method: The paper hypothesizes that watermarks can be embedded into model outputs without altering the model. ShadowMark uses a side channel in the model's API with a key encoder and watermark decoder to achieve this nonintrusive approach.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple model types demonstrate that ShadowMark delivers absolute fidelity, robustness against attacks, and effectiveness for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ShadowMark provides a robust and practical solution for nonintrusive DNN watermarking, eliminating the fidelity-robustness trade-off and supporting various DNN architectures.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

### [313] [VERIRAG: Healthcare Claim Verification via Statistical Audit in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17948)
*Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shusen Liu,Christine Klymko,Shashank Kushwaha,Derek Shi,Wesam Sakla,Sainyam Galhotra,Ruben Glatt*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The VERIRAG framework is introduced to improve retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for clinical decision support by assessing the scientific rigor of retrieved evidence, using an 11-point checklist, a Hard-to-Vary Score, and a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a key limitation in RAG systems for clinical decision support: their inability to assess the scientific rigor or credibility of retrieved evidence, which can lead to the use of low-quality or even retracted studies in decision-making.

Method: The paper proposes VERIRAG, which includes a checklist (the Veritable) to evaluate methodological rigor, a quantitative Hard-to-Vary Score to aggregate evidence quality and diversity, and a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold to adjust evidence requirements based on claim extraordinariness. Its performance was evaluated across four datasets.

Result: The VERIRAG approach achieved F1 scores of 0.53 to 0.65, outperforming baselines by 10-14 points on four diverse datasets, encompassing retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and resolved scientific evidence.

Conclusion: VERIRAG demonstrates a robust improvement in assessing the credibility of evidence in RAG systems, offering enhanced tools for clinical decision support. All materials will be made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes leveraging LLM-based text embedders for Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) in legal systems, addressing limitations of lengthy input handling and lack of training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of legal cases in common law systems makes effective retrieval of past cases critical. Traditional IR methods like BM25 dominate, but state-of-the-art deep learning methods face challenges with lengthy legal text and limited training data.

Method: State-of-the-art LLM-based text embedders are used in an unsupervised manner to overcome text length and training data constraints. LLMs facilitate longer input handling without training data requirements.

Result: LLM-based text embedders outperform traditional BM25 and supervised transformer-based models across four PCR benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The use of LLM-based text embedders offers an effective solution for PCR, addressing major challenges and yielding better performance compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

*Maria Vlachou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel user simulator, Fashion-AlterEval, with improved evaluation capabilities for Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), addressing limitations of existing simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current CRS evaluation methods, specifically their focus on a single target item and reliance on simulated users with unlimited patience, which do not reflect real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset with human judgments on alternative items for fashion CRS datasets, alongside two meta-user simulators capable of critiquing alternative items, changing preferences, and varying patience levels.

Result: Using real datasets (Shoes, Fashion IQ) and existing CRS models, the researchers show that alternative-aware simulators provide richer evaluations, demonstrating prior methods underestimate CRS effectiveness and that considering alternatives better aligns with user satisfaction.

Conclusion: Alternative-aware simulators improve CRS evaluation by enabling adaptive user behavior, suggesting a shift in evaluation practices to better reflect real-world user dynamics and preferences.

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR.EHR, dense retrieval models tailored for EHR data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in clinical information retrieval and question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EHR retrieval systems face challenges due to the semantic gap and insufficient medical knowledge in existing dense retrieval models.

Method: The study develops a two-stage pipeline: stage one uses medical entity extraction and biomedical knowledge injection, while stage two generates diverse training data via large language models. They train two DR.EHR variants (110M and 7B parameters).

Result: The DR.EHR models outperform existing dense retrievers on the CliniQ benchmark and generalize well on EHR QA datasets, handling complex queries involving multiple entities.

Conclusion: DR.EHR provides a significant leap in EHR retrieval systems, offering robust and accurate solutions tailored for clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework using three generative models to compute the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address discrepancies in theoretical and experimental results for hydrogen's thermodynamic properties in the warm dense matter region.

Method: They use a deep variational free energy framework with three neural networks: a normalizing flow model for nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for electron excitation distribution, and a permutational equivariant flow model for electron coordinates. These are optimized jointly to minimize the variational free energy.

Result: Their model provides computation of the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen, with results compared against theoretical and experimental data on the deuterium Hugoniot curve.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully benchmarks deuterium's properties in the warm dense matter region, helping to reconcile prior discrepancies.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense
matter region.

*Arindam Ghosh,Mark Fuhs,Bongjun Kim,Anurag Chowdhury,Monika Woszczyna*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper focuses on extending end-to-end speaker-role diarization (RD) models, particularly for applications like doctor vs. patient roles, by making key training and modeling improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speaker-role diarization is more application-relevant compared to generic speaker diarization, offering clarity in contexts like doctor-patient interactions or host-guest setups.

Method: The study proposes simplifying RD model training using forced alignment and cross-entropy loss, separating predictors for different tasks, and leveraging RD posterior activity for enhanced ASR performance.

Result: The extended RD framework demonstrates improvement by addressing small-word deletion errors and tailoring predictors to suit specific speech and role prediction needs.

Conclusion: Tailored RD-specific approaches are feasible, improving role-based interaction modeling and audio transcription accuracy.

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of

### [319] [Recent Trends in Distant Conversational Speech Recognition: A Review of CHiME-7 and 8 DASR Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18161)
*Samuele Cornell,Christoph Boeddeker,Taejin Park,He Huang,Desh Raj,Matthew Wiesner,Yoshiki Masuyama,Xuankai Chang,Zhong-Qiu Wang,Stefano Squartini,Paola Garcia,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper discusses the CHiME-7 and 8 challenges on distant speech recognition (DASR), analyzing trends and developments in ASR and diarization systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to advance distant speech recognition and diarization methods, especially for challenging conversational speech scenarios.

Method: The authors review the design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems of the challenges and analyze participant submissions to identify significant trends.

Result: Key results include the dominance of end-to-end ASR systems due to pre-trained models, reliance on guided source separation over neural SSE, the importance of diarization refinement, and challenges in spontaneous speech transcription despite advancements.

Conclusion: Spontaneous speech transcription in complex environments remains a challenge, and future work should focus on refining diarization and enhancing neural SSE techniques.

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

*Davide Ghia,Gabriele Ciravegna,Alkis Koudounas,Marco Fantini,Erika Crosetti,Giovanni Succo,Tania Cerquitelli*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores using Explainable AI (XAI) for diagnosing voice disorders to enhance model interpretability, focusing on concept-based methods like CBM and CEM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice disorder diagnostics require automated, non-invasive techniques to improve patient wellbeing. Trustworthiness of current AI models in clinical settings needs improvement.

Method: Investigation of concept-based models like Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept Embedding Model (CEM) to enhance model transparency without compromise on performance.

Result: The concept-based models showed performance on par with deep learning methods, offering interpretable decision-making processes.

Conclusion: CBM and CEM can advance the clinical use of AI by providing explainability alongside high diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how key opinion leaders (KOLs) on social media predict and shape perceptions of emerging technology futures by analyzing 1.5 million posts using advanced text mining techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how public discourse, influenced by social media figures, frames the future of emerging technologies during times of heightened uncertainty.

Method: The paper uses techniques like BERTopic modeling, sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and attitude analysis on posts by 400 KOLs from 2021-2023 to identify 100 related topics.

Result: Positive emotions like Hope dominate discussions on AI-related topics, while Anxiety arises in topics like Climate Change and geopolitical issues. KOLs influence societal narratives by framing technologies as solutions to current challenges.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical role of KOLs in bridging the gap between imagined technological futures and societal realities, significantly influencing anticipatory discourse in uncertain times.

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper compares Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures—Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs)—for toxicity prediction across datasets of varying sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limited exploration of different GNN architectures in AI-driven cheminformatics, focusing on their performance in predicting toxicological assay outcomes.

Method: The research utilized pre-processed molecular graphs and performed binary classification on seven datasets. Each dataset was split into 5 folds with class balance and stratification, followed by Bayesian optimization for each GNN type and dataset (21 optimizations).

Result: GINs consistently outperformed GCNs and GATs on data-abundant assays, while GATs outperformed the others on data-scarce assays. AUC performance averaged between 0.728 to 0.849.

Conclusion: GINs are optimal for data-rich environments, whereas GATs excel in data-scarce scenarios. The distinct nature of GIN architecture is further highlighted by its hyperparameter behavior.

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CM-UNet, a model utilizing self-supervised pre-training to achieve accurate coronary artery segmentation with minimal annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges in accurate coronary artery segmentation due to limited annotated datasets, impacting disease diagnosis and management.

Method: The proposed CM-UNet combines self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets with transfer learning on limited annotated data. The model was fine-tuned with only 18 annotated images, and its performance was compared to baseline models.

Result: CM-UNet showed a smaller drop in Dice score (15.2%) compared to baseline models (46.5%) when trained on 18 annotated images, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: CM-UNet improves segmentation accuracy and reduces dependence on large datasets, enhancing clinical workflows and potentially improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

*Milad Taghipour,Bane Vasic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper applies reinforcement learning (RL) to improve decoding performance for linear block codes, introducing methods such as truncated MDPs, action-list decoding, and feedback-based techniques, with experiments on LDPC codes showcasing its efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and performance of decoding procedures for linear block codes, which are critical for error correction in communications.

Method: The authors map iterative decoding processes to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), introducing techniques like truncated MDPs for state reduction, action-list decoding using Deep-Q networks, and feedback-based reinforcement learning to enhance existing decoders.

Result: Experimental results on LDPC codes over Binary Symmetric Channels (BSC) validate the proposed methods, demonstrating better decoding performance and reduced complexity in RL techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed RL-based decoding methods, including new MDP strategies, action-list decoding, and feedback augmentation, are effective for improving code performance and can be applied across various classes of codes.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

### [325] [Minimax Data Sanitization with Distortion Constraint and Adversarial Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17942)
*Amirarsalan Moatazedian,Yauhen Yakimenka,Rémi A. Chou,Jörg Kliewer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper examines a privacy-preserving data-sharing model where sanitized data is shared with authorized and unauthorized parties, optimizing data reconstruction accuracy for authorized users while maximizing the difficulty for adversaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in data sharing by creating a framework that balances reconstruction accuracy for authorized users and adversaries' inability to reconstruct private data accurately.

Method: The paper adopts a constrained data-driven minimax optimization approach, using a training procedure that alternates updates between the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries. Special cases include Gaussian and binary scenarios for theoretical analysis.

Result: Theoretical results for Gaussian and binary cases provide benchmarks, demonstrating optimal solutions. The proposed minimax training approach validates its efficacy in real-world data-sharing settings.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances accurate reconstruction for collaborators with privacy protection against adversaries, offering a practical, theoretically grounded solution for privacy-preserving data sharing.

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the evolution of AI/ML integration in 5G RAN, addressing its lifecycle management challenges and proposing a standardized framework for adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and lack of transparency, which hinder large-scale adoption of AI/ML models in 5G RAN.

Method: The study reviews 3GPP Releases 16-20 that standardized AI/ML interfaces and lifecycle management, proposing a five-block architecture for effective model transfer, monitoring, and vendor collaboration.

Result: Key advancements include performance monitoring mechanisms, CSI-compression, vendor-agnostic profiles, and collaboration schemes for AI/ML adoption in 5G RAN.

Conclusion: These developments foster AI-native transceivers and establish foundational technologies for enabling 6G networks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

### [327] [Trek-Based Parameter Identification for Linear Causal Models With Arbitrarily Structured Latent Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18170)
*Nils Sturma,Mathias Drton*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new criterion for certifying identifiability of causal effects in linear structural equation models with latent variables using a graphical approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying causal effects in linear structural equation models often rely on restrictive assumptions about independent latent factors. This paper aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: The authors propose a novel latent-subgraph criterion, a purely graphical condition, and develop an algorithm based on solving an integer linear program to check this criterion.

Result: The criterion and algorithm enable the identification of causal effects in models involving observed and latent variables. Additionally, they simplify models with latent variables, making other tools applicable.

Conclusion: The latent-subgraph criterion expands the scope of causal effect identifiability in linear structural equation models, particularly in cases involving complex latent variable structures.

Abstract: We develop a criterion to certify whether causal effects are identifiable in
linear structural equation models with latent variables. Linear structural
equation models correspond to directed graphs whose nodes represent the random
variables of interest and whose edges are weighted with linear coefficients
that correspond to direct causal effects. In contrast to previous
identification methods, we do not restrict ourselves to settings where the
latent variables constitute independent latent factors (i.e., to source nodes
in the graphical representation of the model). Our novel latent-subgraph
criterion is a purely graphical condition that is sufficient for
identifiability of causal effects by rational formulas in the covariance
matrix. To check the latent-subgraph criterion, we provide a sound and complete
algorithm that operates by solving an integer linear program. While it targets
effects involving observed variables, our new criterion is also useful for
identifying effects between latent variables, as it allows one to transform the
given model into a simpler measurement model for which other existing tools
become applicable.

### [328] [Zeroth-order log-concave sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18021)
*Yunbum Kook*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new variant of the proximal sampler for efficiently sampling from log-concave distributions using membership oracles, achieving improved query complexities. It also proposes an annealing scheme for generating warm starts and extends the results to general log-concave distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the efficiency of uniform sampling from convex bodies and log-concave distributions, which play an essential role in optimization, statistics, and machine learning. This effort focuses on minimizing the zeroth-order query complexity while maintaining accuracy guarantees.

Method: The method centers on a variant of the proximal sampler that aligns query complexity with R\'enyi divergence metrics. Additionally, the authors introduce an annealing scheme to generate warm starts using a multi-step approach and employ hypercontractivity principles to relay warmness across the annealing scheme.

Result: The proposed proximal sampler achieves a query complexity involving $\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. The annealing scheme for warm starts requires $\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$ queries, interpolating between existing bounds for total variation and R\'enyi-infinity divergence.

Conclusion: The results contribute to state-of-the-art methods for log-concave sampling by reducing query complexity in both warm-start generation and sampling phases. The findings generalize to broader log-concave distributions and provide deeper insights into hypercontractivity and mixing guarantees.

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

*Elyar Tourani,Brian J. Edwards,Bamin Khomami*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning workflow for identifying and analyzing polymer crystallization pathways, overcoming biases in traditional methods through advanced feature selection and labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of current methods in identifying crystallization pathways in polymers, such as reliance on single order parameters and systematic biases.

Method: An integrated machine learning workflow was developed using atomistic molecular dynamics data. High-dimensional feature vectors were created for atoms, low-dimensional embeddings were used to find structural fingerprints, and unsupervised clustering identified crystalline and amorphous atoms. Supervised learning techniques were also used to identify a minimal set of order parameters.

Result: The study demonstrated that three order parameters are sufficient to accurately capture crystallization labels, achieving over 0.98 classification performance (AUC). The crystallinity index (C-index) was developed for efficient on-the-fly crystallinity computation.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow provides a robust data-driven strategy for identifying order parameters and monitoring structural changes in large-scale polymer simulations. It also supports the hypothesis about entropy and symmetry roles during crystallization stages.

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

TL;DR: Biomedical Foundation Models exhibit vulnerabilities to non-biological features, affecting clinical deployment safety, and the paper proposes a benchmark framework for evaluating and improving their robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the risk of clinical errors in AI-enabled healthcare from non-biological technical features that Foundation Models might learn.

Method: Developed PathoROB benchmark with novel metrics and datasets, applying robustness evaluation experiments to 20 FMs.

Result: Identified robustness deficits in all evaluated FMs, highlighting consequential diagnostic and clinical risks.

Conclusion: Robustness must be a core consideration in Foundation Model design, and PathoROB provides tools for systematic robustness evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

*Binghua Li,Ziqing Chang,Tong Liang,Chao Li,Toshihisa Tanaka,Shigeki Aoki,Qibin Zhao,Zhe Sun*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TenVOO, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for 3D U-Net-based DDPMs in MRI image generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the lack of research on parameter-efficient representations for 3D convolution operations in DDPMs, important for MRI image generation.

Method: The method, named TenVOO, uses tensor network modeling to represent 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with fewer parameters.

Result: TenVOO outperforms existing methods in MS-SSIM on three MRI datasets (ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021) while using only 0.3% of the original model's trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TenVOO is highly effective for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in 3D convolution-based DDPMs, combining state-of-the-art performance with significant parameter savings.

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the diagnostic challenges posed by the heterogeneity of glioblastoma and enhance diagnostic accuracy using deep learning.

Method: Leverage and fine-tune a pre-trained model on the BraTS-Path training dataset for validation via the Synapse platform.

Result: The model achieves an accuracy, recall, and F1-score of 0.392229, a specificity of 0.898704, and an MCC of 0.255267, placing second in the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024 testing phase.

Conclusion: Though the model demonstrates strengths in specificity, its overall predictive power remains limited, illustrating both promise and areas for improvement.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study develops models using hyperspectral imaging and machine learning to predict nitrogen concentration in grapevine leaves and canopies, achieving moderate prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in accurately estimating nitrogen concentration in grapevine leaves due to the spatial and temporal variability of soil nitrogen and to guide site-specific fertilization.

Method: Hyperspectral imaging (400-1000 nm) was utilized on four grapevine cultivars over two growing seasons. Image data underwent feature selection to identify optimal spectral bands, and two machine learning models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, were trained to predict nitrogen levels.

Result: The ML models achieved R-squared values of 0.49 for canopy-level data and 0.57 for leaf-level data, with spectral regions around 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm identified as critical for prediction.

Conclusion: The integration of hyperspectral imaging and ML techniques shows promise for monitoring nitrogen levels in vineyards, though predictive accuracy is moderate and different spectral bands are used for leaf- and canopy-level analyses.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis, while clinically
valuable, faces standardization challenges due to subjective interpretation and

facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice
through standardized, high-quality diagnostic data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid method involving MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model for enhancing atomic crystal imaging, achieving a significant improvement in image reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current multislice electron ptychography (MEP) algorithms, which are time-consuming and yield suboptimal solutions in reconstructing atomic crystal structures.

Method: The authors developed MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on a large crystal structure database, and integrated it into existing reconstruction methods using Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS).

Result: The hybrid approach significantly improved 3D volume reconstruction quality, with a reported 90.50% increase in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MEP-Diffusion proves to be an effective generative prior for MEP, addressing the ill-posed nature of the problem, and offers substantial advancements in computational atomic imaging.

Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that
computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over
existing methods.

*Dou Hoon Kwark,Shirui Luo,Xiyue Zhu,Yudu Li,Zhi-Pei Liang,Volodymyr Kindratenko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical diffusion framework for pseudo-healthy image inpainting in brain MRI, combining 2D models along axial and coronal planes for improved realism and volumetric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in slice-wise 2D models and fully 3D models for brain MRI inpainting, including discontinuities and extensive data requirements.

Method: Uses a hierarchical diffusion framework with axial coarse inpainting followed by coronal detailed refinement, leveraging adaptive resampling for data efficiency and consistency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method's superior realism and volumetric consistency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective solution for pseudo-healthy brain MRI inpainting, balancing realism, consistency, and data efficiency.

Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining
perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data
efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric
consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image
inpainting. Code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks three state-of-the-art MRI abdominal segmentation models and introduces ABDSynth, a synthetic segmentation model trained on CT data, evaluating their accuracy and generalizability across diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in MRI abdominal segmentation due to signal variability and the effort required for annotating datasets, highlighting the need for robust and generalizable segmentation methods.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking of three state-of-the-art models using public datasets with diverse conditions and introducing ABDSynth, a model trained only on widely available CT segmentations for MRI segmentation.

Result: MRSegmentator is identified as the best-performing and most generalizable model. ABDSynth performs slightly less accurately but is a viable alternative due to reduced training data requirements.

Conclusion: MRSegmentator is the leading MRI abdominal segmentation tool in terms of performance and generalizability, while ABDSynth offers a practical solution when annotation resources are limited. Additional resources are provided for future benchmarking and usage.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights

*Hang Xu,Alexandre Bousse,Alessandro Perelli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new deep learning approach, DEcomp-MoD, for superior material decomposition in Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of material decomposition in DECT yield suboptimal results due to inaccuracies caused by post-reconstruction beam-hardening effects, necessitating a method that directly operates on projection data.

Method: The proposed DEcomp-MoD integrates knowledge of the spectral DECT model into the training loss and utilizes a score-based denoising diffusion prior. The method performs inference optimization that directly maps sinogram data to material images through a conditional diffusion model.

Result: Evaluation on synthetic DECT sinograms from the AAPM dataset demonstrated both quantitative and qualitative superiority of DEcomp-MoD over unsupervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DEcomp-MoD outperforms existing approaches, showing promise for deployment in clinical scenarios for effective material decomposition.

Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UniSegDiff, a novel framework based on diffusion probabilistic models, improves lesion segmentation across multiple imaging modalities and organs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show promise in addressing challenges like blurring in medical images, making them potentially effective for lesion segmentation. However, existing methods have issues with uneven timestep attention, leading to inefficiency.

Method: UniSegDiff introduces staged training and inference, dynamically adjusting predictions to ensure attention across all timesteps. The framework also pre-trains a feature extraction network.

Result: UniSegDiff significantly outperforms previous SOTA methods for lesion segmentation across six organs and various imaging modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances the diffusion model’s effectiveness by addressing inefficiencies, achieving unified lesion segmentation and advancing the state of the art in medical image analysis.

Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust framework for gastrointestinal pathology image analysis by improving dataset quality, introducing explicit intermediate reasoning, and utilizing advanced post-training methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of noise and incomplete annotations in existing datasets for gastrointestinal pathology, and to overcome factual hallucinations and lack of reasoning transparency in vision-language models.

Method: A large-scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset was built, integrating a prompt argumentation strategy for lesion classification and anatomical site information, along with a fine-tuning process using supervised methods and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: The proposed method achieved significant improvements in diagnostic report quality, showing 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% better structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors compared to existing models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the proposed approaches lead to superior diagnostic accuracy and clinical applicability, setting a new benchmark for multimodal pathology image analysis.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding that enables efficient, zero-shot deployment despite data scarcity, achieving substantial performance benefits and reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based precoding solutions for mMIMO systems demand high-quality local data, which can be challenging to obtain at deployment sites.

Method: Introduce a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding, augmented with a data augmentation method utilizing cosine similarity to select training samples resembling the target distribution.

Result: The foundation model achieves zero-shot deployment, surpasses zero forcing, nearly reaches weighted MMSE performance with 8x less complexity, and adapts dynamically to user-specific rate demands.

Conclusion: The proposed model addresses challenges like data scarcity and computational complexity, enabling practical implementation of DL-based precoding while facilitating higher-level resource control for energy and spectral efficiency.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

TL;DR: Kit Fine explored logical properties of ignorance, introducing terms like Rumsfeld ignorance. This paper refines definitions to resolve trivialities in axiomatization and builds a formal framework to analyze Fine's results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing definitions of Rumsfeld ignorance rely on identical accessibility relations as standard ignorance, making some results trivial and limiting the ability to differentiate between types of ignorance.

Method: The paper assumes different accessibility relations for implicit knowledge operators in ignorance and Rumsfeld ignorance, allowing one relation to be an arbitrary subset of the other, and establishes axiomatizations across bi-frame classes.

Result: Developed axiomatizations for new definitions over proper bi-frame classes and provided a framework for analyzing previous findings by Kit Fine.

Conclusion: The refined model successfully separates the logical properties of ignorance types while maintaining earlier validities and addressing definability limitations.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study evaluates the impact of personalized instructional sequences on diagnostic reasoning in scenario-based learning using PharmaSim, finding that problem-solving followed by instruction (PS-I) enhances transfer tasks more effectively than instruction-first (I-PS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving diagnostic reasoning among novices, who often face cognitive biases like premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.

Method: A between-groups study design was used with an online SBL environment called PharmaSim, comparing the effects of two instructional sequences: instruction-before-problem-solving (I-PS) and problem-solving-before-instruction (PS-I).

Result: Both instructional sequences improved learning, but the PS-I sequence resulted in significantly better performance on transfer tasks.

Conclusion: Problem-solving followed by instruction (PS-I) is more effective for improving diagnostic reasoning and transfer learning in scenario-based training than instruction followed by problem-solving (I-PS).

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key
challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable approach integrating technical and socio-political factors for broad deployment of automated driving systems across diverse environments and vehicle types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient scalability in automated driving systems arises from the demand to reduce costs, enhance safety, conserve resources, and align with varying global laws, cultural norms, and ethical paradigms.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage fine-tuning process: first, adapting systems to specific environments using a country-specific reward model, and second, employing vehicle-specific transfer learning to ensure compatibility and validate design decisions.

Result: The presented concept integrates technological and socio-political requirements, making scalable deployment of automated driving feasible across various technical, legal, cultural, and ethical contexts.

Conclusion: The study offers a data-driven approach that addresses challenges in adapting automated driving systems effectively across diverse configurations and environments, highlighting the integration of socio-political adaptations and technical scalability.

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.

### [347] [Rapid Modeling Architecture for Lightweight Simulator to Accelerate and Improve Decision Making for Industrial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17990)
*Takumi Kato,Zhi Li Hu*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Rapid Modeling Architecture (RMA) for an industrial simulator to reduce modeling time by 78.3% compared to conventional simulators while retaining critical system details for better decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In industrial system design, early decision-making is hindered by limited information, leading to less accurate designs that are hard to adjust later. Current simulators are too time-consuming to meet agile decision-making needs.

Method: The paper introduces a Rapid Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight simulator. It prioritizes ease of modeling while keeping essential details intact. The prototype simulator is tested on real factory layout design problems.

Result: The prototype simulator demonstrated a 78.3% reduction in modeling time compared to existing simulators, significantly easing the modeling process without sacrificing necessary design details.

Conclusion: The proposed RMA-based simulator effectively accelerates industrial system modeling, making early decision-making more efficient and accurate by reducing time constraints and maintaining essential design fidelity.

Abstract: Designing industrial systems, such as building, improving, and automating
distribution centers and manufacturing plants, involves critical
decision-making with limited information in the early phases. The lack of
information leads to less accurate designs of the systems, which are often
difficult to resolve later. It is effective to use simulators to model the
designed system and find out the issues early. However, the modeling time
required by conventional simulators is too long to allow for rapid model
creation to meet decision-making demands. In this paper, we propose a Rapid
Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator that
mitigates the modeling burden while maintaining the essential details in order
to accelerate and improve decision-making. We have prototyped a simulator based
on the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem. We also
compared the modeling time of our simulator to that of an existing simulator,
and as a result, our simulator achieved a 78.3% reduction in modeling time
compared to conventional simulators.

*Mario Beraha,Stefano Favaro*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable version of the Ewens--Pitman model for microclustering and applies it to efficient entity resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard Ewens--Pitman model lacks scalability in partitioning large datasets while maintaining desired clustering properties.

Method: The authors scale the strength parameter of the Ewens--Pitman model with the sample size and link it with the Pitman--Yor process to develop variational inference schemes for posterior computation.

Result: The proposed method delivers a three-orders-of-magnitude speed-up in entity resolution tasks compared to existing Bayesian methods while retaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: The microclustering Ewens--Pitman model successfully enables scalable and efficient data partitioning, showcasing its utility in entity resolution.

Abstract: We introduce the microclustering Ewens--Pitman model for random partitions,
obtained by scaling the strength parameter of the Ewens--Pitman model linearly
with the sample size. The resulting random partition is shown to have the
microclustering property, namely: the size of the largest cluster grows
sub-linearly with the sample size, while the number of clusters grows linearly.
By leveraging the interplay between the Ewens--Pitman random partition with the
Pitman--Yor process, we develop efficient variational inference schemes for
posterior computation in entity resolution. Our approach achieves a speed-up of
three orders of magnitude over existing Bayesian methods for entity resolution,
while maintaining competitive empirical performance.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates the vulnerabilities of Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models by introducing Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), revealing sub-lexical data memorization and phonetic-to-visual regurgitation risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and demonstrate the vulnerabilities in training data memorization and copyright concerns in Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) and text-to-video generative models.

Method: Introduced Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a technique involving homophonic substitutions to alter lyrics while maintaining their acoustic properties, and analyzed the impact on LS2 and text-to-video models using metrics like CLAP, AudioJudge, and CoverID.

Result: LS2 models regenerate outputs resembling training content despite adversarial prompts, and text-to-video models visually reconstruct elements from original music videos using phoneme-altered prompts. This issue spans languages and genres.

Conclusion: This research reveals critical vulnerabilities in transcript-conditioned generative models, exposing memorization flaws that lead to potential copyright and safety violations, urging a need for more secure generative systems.

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

*Florian List,Yujin Park,Nicholas L. Rodd,Eve Schoen,Florian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: A neural network-based approach was employed to explore the Galactic Center Excess (GCE), revealing possible explanations for its nature, either as diffuse emission or requiring a much larger number of point sources than previously analyzed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the mystery of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which remains unclear whether it's due to dark matter or a population of dim point sources.

Method: The researchers implemented a neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach to incorporate both spatial and spectral data for studying the GCE, surpassing prior spatial-only analysis limitations.

Result: Energy data revealed that the sources in the GCE are significantly dimmer than previously thought. If point sources are the explanation, the analysis predicts over 35,000 or up to 100,000 sources—far more than earlier studies suggested.

Conclusion: The results challenge the point source hypothesis by showing either the GCE is diffuse in nature or requires an exceptionally high number of dim sources, making it consistent with dark matter under certain models.

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

*Sara Giordano,Kornikar Sen,Miguel A. Martin-Delgado*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework using tabular Q-learning to efficiently synthesize quantum circuits that produce target quantum states while optimizing resources like depth and gate counts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently synthesizing quantum circuits for specified states in both NISQ and future fault-tolerant quantum computing, tackling the exponential growth of state dimensions.

Method: Tabular Q-learning combined with state-space discretization, sparse matrix representations, and a hybrid reward mechanism that includes static guides and dynamic penalties to optimize circuits.

Result: The framework discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts for tasks like graph-state preparation for up to seven qubits and adapts to universal gate sets.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach effectively explores complex quantum state spaces and synthesizes resource-efficient circuits, showing scalability, robustness, and adaptability for quantum circuit optimization.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical model-based reinforcement learning method, achieving faster planning in partially observable environments with sparse Bayesian networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to leverage quantum computational advancements to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments, especially aiming for speedups in inference and planning processes.

Method: The authors propose QBRL, which combines quantum rejection sampling with amplitude amplification for efficient belief updates. They provide a fault-tolerant, oracle-free complexity analysis and demonstrate its application in model-based RL.

Result: They show sub-quadratic speedups in near-optimal planning for environments with sparse Bayesian networks, supported by numerical simulations comparing QBRL with classical RL methods.

Conclusion: QBRL offers a significant computational advantage over classical methods in specific settings, particularly in partially observable environments with sparse structures, but its effectiveness varies with deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: The paper applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict multipactor susceptibility, overcoming computational challenges in RF and accelerator design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the prediction of multipactor susceptibility, a phenomenon that affects high-power RF device performance, using machine learning.

Method: Regression models (Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptrons) were trained on simulation data to predict electron growth rates across different materials.

Result: Tree-based models outperformed MLPs in generalization, while optimized MLPs showed better results under specific multi-objective training functions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the strengths and limitations of ML for multipactor prediction and supports its potential for accelerating RF and accelerator system design processes.

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

TL;DR: This paper presents a zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models, eliminating the need for per-instance fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scalability limitations of existing methods which require per-instance fine-tuning for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video generation.

Method: The authors use structured 2x2 video grids and lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and composition, along with a Grid Fill module for completing layouts during inference.

Result: The framework achieves high-quality, temporally coherent, and identity-preserving video generation for unseen dynamic concepts without requiring test-time optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot method enables efficient and scalable personalization in text-to-video models while generalizing effectively to unseen concepts.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

TL;DR: GeoAvatar improves 3D head avatar generation with adaptive geometrical Gaussian splatting, emphasizing reconstruction precision and animation fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance identity preservation and realistic animations because of their inability to handle geometrical deviations across distinct facial regions.

Method: GeoAvatar uses an Adaptive Pre-allocation Stage (APS) for segmenting Gaussians and introduces a novel mouth structure with part-wise deformation strategy, along with a regularization loss for accurate rigging.

Result: GeoAvatar demonstrates superior quality in both identity reconstruction and animation across novel poses, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar effectively resolves challenges in 3D head avatar generation by improving adaptability in Gaussian representation and enhancing animation precision, especially for dynamic facial expressions.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach for real-time, on-device facial animation using machine learning by employing hybrid knowledge distillation to train compact models, making these animations feasible without large datasets or pre-trained encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for speech-driven 3D facial animation rely on large datasets and models that lack practicality for real-time or on-device applications in areas like game development.

Method: The authors use hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling to train smaller student models from a robust teacher model using only standard convolutional and fully-connected layers.

Result: The proposed approach reduces the memory footprint to as low as 3.4 MB and future audio context to just 81 ms, while retaining high-quality facial animations.

Conclusion: The work enables practical, on-device, real-time facial animation, potentially advancing realistic digital characters in applications like game development.

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

Motivation: Inverse rendering methods under fixed lighting are limited in accuracy, and current methods with multi-view photometric stereo are computationally inefficient. This paper aims to address this gap with a novel approach.

Method: The proposed method (PS-GS) uses Gaussian splatting to initialize geometry and incorporates deferred inverse rendering using the full rendering equation with a lighting-computing neural network. It also applies 2D Gaussian ray-tracing to refine lighting and leverages multi-view and multi-light images with photometric stereo-based regularization to improve optimization.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that PS-GS surpasses prior methods in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PS-GS offers a robust and efficient solution to 3D reconstruction by integrating geometry, material, and lighting estimation, making it suitable for tasks like novel-view synthesis and material editing.

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

### [362] [Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control I: Penalty Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18114)
*Lechen Feng,Xun Li,Yuan-Hua Ni*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified nonconvex optimization framework for designing group-sparse feedback controllers for large-scale linear-quadratic (LQ) problems, offering a penalty-based PALM algorithm with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study focuses on addressing scalable and structure-aware control challenges in large-scale systems, specifically in distributed LQ and sparse feedback LQ problems.

Method: The authors formulate the controller synthesis as a finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $
abla l_{0}$-norm penalization and propose a penalty-based proximal alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm.

Result: The approach ensures efficient solving of subproblems, guarantees global convergence to critical points, and caters to general sparsity patterns without relying on convex relaxations or restrictive assumptions.

Conclusion: The research provides a robust framework with theoretical guarantees for the direct design of group-sparse feedback controllers, advancing scalable and systematic designs beyond conventional limitations.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

### [363] [Enabling Scalability in Asynchronous and Bidirectional Communication in LPWAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17905)
*Mahbubur Rahman*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper focuses on enhancing the scalability and efficiency of SNOW, an LPWAN technology, to handle massive IoT and CPS applications with numerous asynchronous sensors transmitting and receiving data simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing scalability challenges in LPWANs, particularly for emerging IoT and CPS applications that require efficient and low-latency communication among a large number of sensors.

Method: The authors propose leveraging Gold code-based PN sequences and distributed OFDM subcarriers. This facilitates concurrent decoding and data reception/transmission among asynchronous sensors on both the same and different subcarriers.

Result: The proposed solution achieves approximately 9x scalability improvements in SNOW, with enhanced timeliness in data collection at the base station and better energy efficiency for sensors.

Conclusion: The advancements enable SNOW to effectively support IoT and CPS applications involving tens of thousands of sensors, allowing for longer sensor battery life and timely data-driven decision-making.

Abstract: LPWANs have become ubiquitous due to their ability to connect sensors over
large geographic areas in a single hop. It is, however, very challenging to
achieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data
efficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may
require. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly
advancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel
reception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a
different subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by
enabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on
the same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well.
Additionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data
from the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data
parallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold
code-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering
within and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the
set for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive
concurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve
approximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection
at the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and
CPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery
life and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.

*Arijit Shaw,Kuldeep S. Meel*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'pact,' a novel hashing-based SMT model counter for hybrid formulas, which significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of success rate and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to enhance SMT solvers' capabilities for model counting in hybrid formulas, as existing methods like bit-blasting are insufficient for counting solutions projected on the discrete domain.

Method: The authors propose 'pact,' an approximate model counting method for hybrid formulas that utilizes hashing-based techniques with optimized hash functions, offering theoretical solution guarantees and requiring logarithmic SMT calls.

Result: The 'pact' method successfully finished 603 instances out of 14,202 benchmarks, vastly outperforming the baseline method, which completed only 13 instances.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that 'pact' is a highly effective tool for SMT model counting in hybrid formulas, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches and setting a new standard in performance and applicability.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning,
solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent
progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities
toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches,
like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the
challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid
formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses
hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical
guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the
projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves
significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of
benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished
on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.
