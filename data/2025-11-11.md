### [1] [Evidence-Bound Autonomous Research (EviBound): A Governance Framework for Eliminating False Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05524)
*Ruiying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EviBound framework prevents false claims by LLM-based agents through dual governance gates that validate execution and results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address false claims made by autonomous research agents in reporting tasks and results.

Method: EviBound implements two governance gates: pre-execution approval (validates schema compliance) and post-execution verification (checks artifacts, metrics, and run IDs).

Result: Evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks, EviBound achieved 0% false claims, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Research integrity can be guaranteed through governance architecture rather than relying solely on model improvements.

Abstract: LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked "complete" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.
  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.
  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.
  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale.

### [2] [SMAGDi: Socratic Multi Agent Interaction Graph Distillation for Efficient High Accuracy Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05528)
*Aayush Aluru,Myra Malik,Samarth Patankar,Spencer Kim,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMAGDi distills a multi-agent system's debate dynamics into a smaller student model using interaction graphs and Socratic methods, achieving efficiency and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems provide high reasoning accuracy but can be computationally expensive, necessitating efficient alternatives.

Method: SMAGDi utilizes directed interaction graphs to represent debate dynamics and trains its student model using a composite objective to retain fluency and reasoning structure.

Result: SMAGDi compresses a large multi-agent system into a smaller model with 88% accuracy retention, outperforming prior distillation methods.

Conclusion: SMAGDi demonstrates that modeling interaction graphs and Socratic decomposition enables efficient and accurate student models for real-world use.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) often achieve higher reasoning accuracy than single models, but their reliance on repeated debates across agents makes them computationally expensive. We introduce SMAGDi, a distillation framework that transfers the debate dynamics of a five-agent Llama-based MAS into a compact Socratic decomposer-solver student. SMAGDi represents debate traces as directed interaction graphs, where nodes encode intermediate reasoning steps with correctness labels and edges capture continuity and cross-agent influence. The student is trained with a composite objective combining language modeling, graph-based supervision, contrastive reasoning, and embedding alignment to preserve both fluency and structured reasoning. On StrategyQA and MMLU, SMAGDi compresses a 40B multi-agent system into a 6B student while retaining 88% of its accuracy, substantially outperforming prior distillation methods such as MAGDi, standard KD, and fine-tuned baselines. These results highlight that explicitly modeling interaction graphs and Socratic decomposition enable small models to inherit the accuracy benefits of multi-agent debate while remaining efficient enough for real-world deployment.

### [3] [From Prompts to Power: Measuring the Energy Footprint of LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05597)
*Francisco Caravaca,Ángel Cuevas,Rubén Cuevas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates inference energy consumption in Large Language Models (LLMs), presenting extensive measurements and a predictive model to estimate energy usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The energy demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, have drastically increased, prompting the need for systematic analysis and awareness of their environmental impact.

Method: A measurement-based study involving 32,500 inference energy usage measurements across diverse GPU setups and models, analyzed using the vLLM inference engine to quantify energy at the prompt level.

Result: Insights into energy usage patterns were derived, and a predictive model was developed to estimate unseen inference energy consumption effectively.

Conclusion: LLM inference requires significant energy, motivating awareness and optimization. The predictive model and browser extension aim to highlight environmental implications and guide efficient deployment.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented energy demands, extending beyond training to large-scale inference workloads that often dominate total lifecycle consumption. Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.

### [4] [CoT-X: An Adaptive Framework for Cross-Model Chain-of-Thought Transfer and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05747)
*Ziqian Bi,Kaijie Chen,Tianyang Wang,Junfeng Hao,Xinyuan Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to compress reasoning traces for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, improving efficiency and accuracy in resource-constrained settings while maintaining critical reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning improves LLM problem-solving but increases inference costs, posing challenges in resource-constrained environments. Efficient methods are needed for CoT transfer across models.

Method: The authors propose adaptive reasoning summarization using semantic segmentation, importance scoring, dynamic compression based on budget, and coherence reconstruction to reduce token usage while preserving key reasoning steps.

Result: Experiments demonstrate up to a 40% accuracy improvement over truncation for medical exam questions under identical token constraints. Evaluation validates strong transferability across 64 model pairs (spanning 1.5B-32B parameters) and reveals model size correlates with robustness.

Conclusion: Efficient CoT transfer through reasoning summarization enables advanced reasoning capabilities with lower computational costs, providing practical solutions for resource-constrained LLM deployment.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but leads to substantial inference overhead, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints. Code will be released upon publication.

### [5] [Anchors in the Machine: Behavioral and Attributional Evidence of Anchoring Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05766)
*Felipe Valencia-Clavijo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study examines anchoring bias in large language models (LLMs), revealing that this cognitive bias is robust, measurable, and linked to model sensitivity and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether observed biases in LLMs like anchoring are due to superficial imitation or inherent probability shifts, and to understand their internal mechanisms.

Method: The authors employed a log-probability-based behavioral analysis, Shapley-value attribution, and developed an Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score across six open-source models to measure anchoring effects.

Result: The study found strong anchoring bias in models like Gemma-2B and Llama-2-7B and determined that model scale affects sensitivity to this bias; attribution effects were model-dependent and varied with prompt designs.

Conclusion: Anchoring bias is demonstrated to be a robust phenomenon in LLMs, though its behavior varies with model size and design. This work advances the understanding of cognitive biases in LLMs while addressing safety and interpretability risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.

### [6] [DiagnoLLM: A Hybrid Bayesian Neural Language Framework for Interpretable Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05810)
*Bowen Xu,Xinyue Zeng,Jiazhen Hu,Tuo Wang,Adithya Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiagnoLLM, a hybrid framework for interpretable and accurate disease diagnosis combining Bayesian modeling, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build trustworthy clinical AI systems through transparent and biologically grounded analyses that enhance human trust and support in diagnostics.

Method: The method includes the GP-unmix model for gene profiling, eQTL-driven neural classifiers for Alzheimer's detection, and LLMs for generating tailored diagnostic reports.

Result: DiagnoLLM achieved 88% accuracy in Alzheimer's detection and generated evaluated diagnostic reports that were actionable and audiences-specific.

Conclusion: LLMs, used as post-hoc interpreters, can amplify transparency and trustworthiness in hybrid diagnostic pipelines, supporting medical stakeholders effectively.

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

### [7] [Can a Small Model Learn to Look Before It Leaps? Dynamic Learning and Proactive Correction for Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05854)
*Zepeng Bao,Shen Zhou,Qiankun Pi,Jianhao Chen,Mayi Xu,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hallucination in LLMs is addressed through a novel framework (LEAP) that dynamically learns and adapts strategies for hallucination detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their safe deployment. Existing detection methods rely on fixed strategies or costly and limited alternatives, leading to inefficacy in dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed LEAP framework uses a teacher-student architecture for dynamic strategy learning. The teacher generates and adapts planning strategies, which are distilled into a student model. The student employs proactive corrections for optimized strategies.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks show that the LEAP framework surpasses current state-of-the-art hallucination detection methods.

Conclusion: The LEAP framework enhances adaptability and effectiveness in hallucination detection while mitigating costs, pushing the boundaries of safe and dynamic LLM application.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to their safe deployment. Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods require pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the quality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too costly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student architecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent tuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with a dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and inappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address the problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative ``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an efficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction capabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the hallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We first employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic learning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures. We then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student model via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model adopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and optimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate through experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [8] [An Empirical Study of Reasoning Steps in Thinking Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05874)
*Haoran Xue,Gias Uddin,Song Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies reasoning quality in large language models (LLMs) for code generation, evaluating six models on various tasks and identifying areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess the reasoning chains produced by thinking LLMs in code generation to understand their effectiveness, transparency, and areas for enhancement.

Method: The study involves empirical evaluation of six LLMs across 100 code generation tasks with varying difficulties, analyses reasoning structure and success rates, conducts step-budget interventions, and performs human evaluations of efficiency, correctness, and completeness.

Result: Step-count interventions show varying impacts on success rates. Incompleteness is found as a dominant reasoning failure mode, particularly in harder tasks. Reasoning stability is observed with logical structure consistency across effort levels.

Conclusion: Thinking LLMs show promise for code generation with strengths in logical consistency and self-correction, but struggle in completeness especially for complex tasks.

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces before final answers, potentially improving transparency, interpretability, and solution accuracy for code generation. However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering.

### [9] [Unveiling Modality Bias: Automated Sample-Specific Analysis for Multimodal Misinformation Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05883)
*Hehai Lin,Hui Liu,Shilei Cao,Jing Li,Haoliang Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in multimodal misinformation benchmarks by proposing three methods to detect modality bias at the sample level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal misinformation benchmarks are biased toward specific modalities, making detectors rely on one modality, and current methods lack scalability and insights at the sample level.

Method: Three bias quantification methods are proposed: coarse-grained evaluation, medium-grained information flow analysis, and fine-grained causality analysis.

Result: Human evaluation on benchmarks revealed the key findings: importance of combining multiple views, susceptibility of automated analysis to detector fluctuations, and differing efficacy of views depending on sample bias.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for multimodal approaches and provides insights for enhancing unbiased benchmarks and robust automated bias evaluation techniques.

Abstract: Numerous multimodal misinformation benchmarks exhibit bias toward specific modalities, allowing detectors to make predictions based solely on one modality. While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

### [10] [Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience for Plan-Guided Policy Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05931)
*Hiroaki Hayashi,Bo Pang,Wenting Zhao,Ye Liu,Akash Gokul,Srijan Bansal,Caiming Xiong,Semih Yavuz,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a framework allowing language model agents to self-improve by learning from their own past task executions, significantly boosting their task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model-based agents for software engineering tasks lack a mechanism to learn and improve from their previous executions, limiting their performance to the capabilities of their base design and models.

Method: The proposed SAGE framework enables agents to distill concise plan abstractions from their task experiences, capturing essential steps, dependencies, and constraints, which are then used as contextual guidance to refine their subsequent executions.

Result: SAGE demonstrates consistent performance improvements across various agent architectures and LLM backbones, including a 7.2% improvement over a strong baseline and high success rates on the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark.

Conclusion: The SAGE framework enables significant enhancement in language model agent performance by introducing a mechanism for self-learning from past experiences, making it adaptable for diverse agent frameworks and language models in software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents are increasingly used to tackle software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and code modification, demonstrating promising yet limited performance. However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone. SAGE further achieves strong overall performance on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reaching 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates with the Mini-SWE-Agent and OpenHands CodeAct agent framework, respectively.

Conclusion: Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge demonstrates the effectiveness of combining SFT and RL for training robust agentic models, contributing significantly to open-source advancements.

Abstract: Despite the proliferation of powerful agentic models, the lack of critical post-training details hinders the development of strong counterparts in the open-source community. In this study, we present a comprehensive and fully open-source pipeline for training a high-performance agentic model for interacting with external tools and environments, named Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge, starting from the Qwen3-8B base model. We design effective supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic data followed by multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to unlock the potential for multiple diverse agentic tasks. We perform exclusive experiments on various agentic benchmarks in both tool use and coding domains. Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance among LLMs of similar size and remains competitive with significantly larger models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge traditional approaches in existing literature by introducing a framework treating agent awareness as knowledge.

*Lianrui Li,Dakuan Lu,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScRPO is a reinforcement learning framework enhancing large language models on mathematical tasks through error reflection and correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving large language models in solving difficult mathematical problems with limited external feedback.

Method: ScRPO involves a two-stage process: first, trial-and-error learning using GRPO, collecting errors; second, self-correction learning that focuses on error reflection.

Result: Experiments across benchmarks demonstrate ScRPO’s superior performance compared to other post-training methods.

Conclusion: ScRPO represents a promising approach for self-improvement in AI models, enhancing reliability and capabilities with minimal external intervention.

Abstract: We propose Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance large language models on challenging mathematical problems by leveraging self-reflection and error correction. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage: training the model with GRPO and collecting incorrect answers along with their corresponding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous answers were wrong. Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The experimental results demonstrate that ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings highlight ScRPO as a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way toward more reliable and capable AI systems.

### [14] [Maestro: Learning to Collaborate via Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization for Multi-Agent LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06134)
*Wei Yang,Jiacheng Pang,Shixuan Li,Paul Bogdan,Stephen Tu,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Maestro, a multi-agent framework for solving complex problems using large language models, aiming to improve on existing issues like premature consensus and poor credit assignment. Incorporating a novel reinforcement learning approach (CLPO), it shows significant accuracy improvements over other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle key challenges in multi-agent systems built on large language models, such as balancing exploration and synthesis, avoiding premature consensus, and solving credit assignment problems.

Method: The proposed method, Maestro, uses separate agents for exploration (Execution Agents) and synthesis (Central Agent). It employs Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles strategic and tactical signals for improved decision-making.

Result: Experiments show that Maestro paired with CLPO outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent systems, with accuracy gains averaging 6% and reaching up to 10%.

Conclusion: Maestro successfully addresses critical limitations in multi-agent systems built on large language models by introducing a structured approach to cognitive tension and strategic decision-making, advancing the field of complex problem-solving.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to approach complex problems and can surpass single model inference. However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.

*Stefano Ferraro,Akihiro Nakano,Masahiro Suzuki,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DLPWM, which is an object-centric world model designed to enhance compositional generalization in reinforcement learning by learning disentangled object-level representations from pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether disentangled object-level representations can localize relevant information and improve policy performance for reinforcement learning across varying feature combinations.

Method: DLPWM is a fully unsupervised object-centric world model that directly learns object-level latents from pixels to improve visual reconstruction, prediction, and handle OOD variations.

Result: DLPWM demonstrated robust visual modeling capabilities but underperformed in policy learning compared to DreamerV3. Representation shift during multi-object interactions was identified as causing unstable policy learning.

Conclusion: While object-centric perception enhances visual modeling, stable reinforcement learning control requires addressing latent drift and representation shift.

Abstract: Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose visual scenes into object-level representations, providing structured abstractions that could improve compositional generalization and data efficiency in reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.

### [16] [MALinZero: Efficient Low-Dimensional Search for Mastering Complex Multi-Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06142)
*Sizhe Tang,Jiayu Chen,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MALinZero, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach for multi-agent systems leveraging low-dimensional representations to handle the exponential growth of action spaces and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of handling large combinatorial action spaces in multi-agent planning, which hampers effective exploration and exploitation in traditional MCTS.

Method: Develops MALinZero, which projects joint-action returns into a low-dimensional space using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation solved with smooth loss functions. It introduces LinUCT for tree exploration and offers a submodular (1-1/e)-approximation for joint action selection.

Result: MALinZero achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks (e.g., matrix games, SC2-based environments like SMAC and SMACv2), outperforming current model-based and model-free methods with faster learning and superior results.

Conclusion: MALinZero enables efficient MCTS in multi-agent settings by reducing complexity with low-dimensional representations, achieving faster, more effective multi-agent planning.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which leverages Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCTs) to balance exploration and exploitation through randomized sampling, is instrumental to solving complex planning problems. However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective. MALinZero demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks such as matrix games, SMAC, and SMACv2, outperforming both model-based and model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.

### [17] [Evaluating Implicit Biases in LLM Reasoning through Logic Grid Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06160)
*Fatima Jahara,Mark Dredze,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PRIME, a framework using logic puzzles to evaluate implicit social biases in LLMs during reasoning tasks, focusing on gender stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety approaches for language models fail to address subtle social biases that emerge in complex reasoning tasks. A systematic evaluation method is needed to address this gap.

Method: PRIME employs logic grid puzzles categorized into stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral variants, enabling controlled testing of biases with models across varying puzzle complexities.

Result: The evaluation findings show LLMs exhibit more accurate reasoning when solutions align with social stereotypes, highlighting underlying bias in their deductive processes.

Conclusion: PRIME is effective in diagnosing and quantifying subtle biases in LLMs' reasoning processes, especially where fairness is crucial.

Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.

*Boxuan Wang,Zhuoyun Li,Xinmiao Huang,Xiaowei Huang,Yi Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Alignment Score metric for assessing and improving reasoning consistency in LLMs, and proposes the SCOS method to optimize reasoning with reduced errors, enhancing longer reasoning chain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance reasoning consistency in Large Language Models, particularly in Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Method: A new metric called Alignment Score to measure semantic alignment in reasoning, and SCOS, a sampling method optimizing chains with minimal alignment errors.

Result: SCOS improves Alignment Scores by reducing alignment errors, achieving an average improvement of 29.84% in tasks with longer reasoning chains.

Conclusion: The framework and SCOS method provide effective tools to improve reasoning consistency and semantic alignment in LLMs, especially for extended reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for evaluating and optimizing reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a new metric, the Alignment Score, which quantifies the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks.

### [19] [CSP4SDG: Constraint and Information-Theory Based Role Identification in Social Deduction Games with LLM-Enhanced Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06175)
*Kaijie Xu,Fandi Meng,Clark Verbrugge,Simon Lucas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework (CSP4SDG) for role inference in social deduction games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately identifying hidden roles in social deduction games, a key determinant of performance for both humans and AI.

Method: CSP4SDG integrates game events, dialogue, and four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes, using probabilistic reasoning, hard/soft constraints, and entropy-based weightings to infer roles.

Result: CSP4SDG outperforms LLM-based baselines in inference tasks and improves LLM performance when used as an auxiliary tool.

Conclusion: Probabilistic reasoning frameworks like CSP4SDG present a scalable and interpretable alternative or supplement to neural models in social deduction games.

Abstract: In Social Deduction Games (SDGs) such as Avalon, Mafia, and Werewolf, players conceal their identities and deliberately mislead others, making hidden-role inference a central and demanding task. Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time. Experiments on three public datasets show that CSP4SDG (i) outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario, and (ii) boosts LLMs when supplied as an auxiliary "reasoning tool." Our study validates that principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory is a scalable alternative-or complement-to heavy-weight neural models for SDGs.

Leveraging large language model (LLM) reasoning and grounded validation, Data Agent automatically performs data cleaning, hierarchical routing, and feature-level optimization through dual feedback loops. It embodies three core principles: automatic, safe, and non-expert friendly, which ensure end-to-end reliability without human supervision. This demo showcases the first practical realization of an autonomous Data Agent, illustrating how raw data can be transformed "From Data to Better Data."

### [21] [Reasoning with Confidence: Efficient Verification of LLM Reasoning Steps via Uncertainty Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06209)
*Jingwei Ni,Ekaterina Fadeeva,Tianyi Wu,Mubashara Akhtar,Jiaheng Zhang,Elliott Ash,Markus Leippold,Timothy Baldwin,See-Kiong Ng,Artem Shelmanov,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight methodology for verifying reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs) using uncertainty quantification (UHeads), outperforming larger Process Reward Models (PRMs) in multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning step verification methods in LLMs either require extensive computational resources, domain-specific adaptations, or large-scale annotations, limiting scalability and generalization.

Method: The authors proposed training data-driven transformer-based uncertainty heads (UHeads) that leverage frozen LLM internal states for estimating uncertainty during reasoning. It employs either self-supervised labels or labels generated by larger LLMs.

Result: UHeads are effective, lightweight (with less than 10M parameters), and exhibit comparable or superior performance to larger PRMs (up to 810x larger) across various domains like mathematics, planning, and question answering.

Conclusion: Internal states of LLMs encode uncertainty, offering a scalable and generalizable approach to introspective reasoning verification for complex tasks.

Abstract: Solving complex tasks usually requires LLMs to generate long multi-step reasoning chains. Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VibeThinker-1.5B challenges the notion that small models lack robust reasoning by demonstrating superior reasoning and efficiency compared to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies and cost concerns of scaling model parameters while achieving high reasoning capabilities.

Method: Developed using the Spectrum-to-Signal Principle, which applies Diversity-Exploring Distillation and MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization.

Result: VibeThinker-1.5B outperforms larger closed-source models on math and code benchmarks, with reduced training costs.

Conclusion: Small models like VibeThinker-1.5B can rival larger models in reasoning tasks, promoting cost-effective and accessible AI research.

Abstract: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

### [23] [ROAR: Robust Accident Recognition and Anticipation for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06226)
*Xingcheng Liu,Yanchen Guan,Haicheng Liao,Zhengbing He,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study introduces ROAR, a method for accurate accident anticipation in autonomous vehicles, addressing real-world challenges such as sensor failures and environmental noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for accident anticipation in AVs fail to account for sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and variability in driver behavior, leading to poor performance in real-world conditions.

Method: ROAR utilizes Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for feature extraction, a self-adaptive object-aware module for spatial-temporal relationships, and dynamic focal loss to address class imbalance.

Result: ROAR outperforms existing baselines on datasets such as DAD, CCD, and A3D, showing improved Average Precision and mean Time to Accident under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: ROAR is robust in real-world conditions, offering a reliable solution for accident anticipation, even with degraded sensors and imbalanced data.

Abstract: Accurate accident anticipation is essential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.

*Siming Zhao,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes GAIA, a governance-first framework for using LLMs in B2B negotiation focused on safety, accountability, and human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of deploying AI systems in high-stakes B2B scenarios, emphasizing the need for governance to prevent unauthorized actions, ensure informed decisions, and maintain human oversight.

Method: The GAIA framework introduces three essential roles (Principal, Delegate, Counterparty) and mechanisms like information-gated progression, dual feedback integration, and authorization boundaries to ensure safe AI delegation.

Result: GAIA provides structured mechanisms for separating screening tasks from negotiation, integrating AI and human corrections, and setting boundaries for AI autonomy.

Conclusion: The framework ensures safe, efficient, and accountable delegation of tasks to AI systems in B2B workflows and can be adapted to various industries like procurement, real estate, and staffing.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly exploring delegation of screening and negotiation tasks to AI systems, yet deployment in high-stakes B2B settings is constrained by governance: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining effective human oversight and auditability. Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-improving framework to enhance financial reasoning by using synthetic data generation and optimization techniques to refine prompts for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in financial reasoning with LLMs, including the fixed dataset dependency and expensive manual labeling, through a dynamic approach.

Method: A closed-loop framework involving synthetic data generation, validation through verifiers, and iterative prompt optimization.

Result: The model achieved higher accuracy and robustness on the DocMath-Eval benchmark compared to standard prompt methods.

Conclusion: Synthetic data-driven prompt refinement is effective in improving numerical reasoning for financial tasks in large language models.

Abstract: Financial documents like earning reports or balance sheets often involve long tables and multi-page reports. Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A lack of publicly available tabular datasets for evaluating STI systems in the security domain prompted the creation of a new dataset.

Method: The authors constructed the Secu-Table dataset using security data from CVE and CWE sources, annotated utilizing Wikidata and the SEPSES CSKG.

Result: The dataset consists of 1500+ tables and 15,000+ entities, publicly released alongside code for research in the SemTab challenge.

Conclusion: Secu-Table provides researchers with a robust dataset for testing STI systems and drives progress in tabular semantic interpretation within the cybersecurity domain.

Abstract: Evaluating semantic tables interpretation (STI) systems, (particularly, those based on Large Language Models- LLMs) especially in domain-specific contexts such as the security domain, depends heavily on the dataset. However, in the security domain, tabular datasets for state-of-the-art are not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce Secu-Table dataset, composed of more than 1500 tables with more than 15k entities constructed using security data extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data sources and annotated using Wikidata and the SEmantic Processing of Security Event Streams CyberSecurity Knowledge Graph (SEPSES CSKG). Along with the dataset, all the code is publicly released. This dataset is made available to the research community in the context of the SemTab challenge on Tabular to Knowledge Graph Matching. This challenge aims to evaluate the performance of several STI based on open source LLMs. Preliminary evaluation, serving as baseline, was conducted using Falcon3-7b-instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct, two open source LLMs and GPT-4o mini one closed source LLM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an autonomous environment where AI agents can independently conduct scientific research without centralized coordination, aiming to drive emergent scientific discovery beyond traditional optimization paradigms.

Method: The authors develop STATION, enabling AI agents to undertake independent tasks such as hypothesis generation, peer interaction, code execution, and publishing results, fostering emergent behavior in a multi-agent context.

Result: The AI agents in STATION perform better than state-of-the-art benchmarks, exemplified by advancements in areas like computational biology and machine learning, while organically developing novel methods like density-adaptive algorithms for scRNA-seq.

Conclusion: STATION represents a breakthrough in autonomous scientific discovery, emphasizing emergent behavior and open-ended exploration beyond rigid scientific workflows.

Abstract: We introduce the STATION, an open-world multi-agent environment that models a miniature scientific ecosystem. Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration. The Station marks a first step towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in an open-world environment, representing a new paradigm that moves beyond rigid optimization.

*MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury,Moazzem Hossain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ALIGN, a framework for inferring accident coordinates from text and map cues to improve crash data geolocation in low- and middle-income countries, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of accurate geospatial crash data in low- and middle-income countries, especially in multilingual and unstructured text environments.

Method: ALIGN combines optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification using a multi-stage pipeline integrating large vision-language models.

Result: ALIGN achieves improved geolocation accuracy in Bangla-language news data compared to traditional geoparsing methods.

Conclusion: ALIGN enhances automated crash mapping in low-data regions, supporting road safety policies and multimodal AI integration in transportation analytics.

Abstract: Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Method: LPFQA benchmark was created using authentic professional forums across academic and industrial fields, integrating innovative evaluation dimensions, hierarchical difficulty levels, realistic user personas, and interdisciplinary knowledge.

Result: Significant performance disparities were observed among 12 mainstream LLMs evaluated with LPFQA, particularly in specialized reasoning tasks, confirming its discriminative evaluation properties.

Conclusion: LPFQA serves as a robust benchmark that advances LLM evaluation, addresses gaps in testing for real-world application performance, and aids in future model enhancement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in reasoning, question answering, and professional applications; however, their true capabilities remain difficult to evaluate using existing benchmarks. Current datasets often focus on simplified tasks or artificial scenarios, overlooking long-tail knowledge and the complexities of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge-based benchmark derived from authentic professional forums across 20 academic and industrial fields, covering 502 tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA introduces four key innovations: fine-grained evaluation dimensions that target knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; a hierarchical difficulty structure that ensures semantic clarity and unique answers; authentic professional scenario modeling with realistic user personas; and interdisciplinary knowledge integration across diverse domains. We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development.

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in LLMs' ability to generate novel insights during reasoning tasks, introducing Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO) to improve reflection and knowledge exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to generate new insights or cognitive refinement during reasoning, especially outside mathematical tasks, due to uncontrollable information flow and insufficient internal exploration.

Method: AEPO employs Reflection-aware Information Filtration to regulate cognitive information flow and Adaptive-Entropy Optimization to balance exploration and exploitation during reasoning stages.

Result: AEPO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance over existing reinforcement learning methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: AEPO effectively enhances reasoning in LLMs by addressing echo-like behavior and fostering new insights through adaptive optimization techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as "Echo Reflection". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a cost-efficient judging framework using Small Language Models (SLMs) for safety evaluations, supported by a newly developed benchmark called HAJailBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of using frontier models for LLM safety evaluation limits scalability, necessitating a more cost-efficient approach.

Method: A multi-agent framework utilizing structured debates between critic, defender, and judge agents using SLMs, combined with the HAJailBench benchmark.

Result: Achieved agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while significantly reducing costs. Three debate rounds proved optimal for balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: SLMs, when organized within structured debates, are effective for safety evaluations in LLMs, supported by HAJailBench for scalable, rigorous assessment.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

*Zhi Zheng,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to enhance soft-thinking reasoning for LLMs, achieving better accuracy over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of using reinforcement learning (RL) with soft-thinking paradigms in LLMs and to unlock their full potential in reasoning tasks.

Method: The authors propose SofT-GRPO, which uses Gumbel noise, the Gumbel-Softmax technique to ensure tokens remain within the pre-trained embedding space, and the reparameterization trick for improved policy optimization.

Result: SofT-GRPO allows LLMs to marginally outperform discrete token GRPO in Pass@1 accuracy (+0.13%) and significantly in Pass@32 (+2.19%).

Conclusion: The novel SofT-GRPO algorithm successfully demonstrates that soft-thinking LLMs can surpass discrete-token reasoning in specific evaluation scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and potential application.

Abstract: The soft-thinking paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning can outperform the conventional discrete-token Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in some scenarios, underscoring its research and application value. However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

*Xiangwu Guo,Difei Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Auto-Explorer, a tool for autonomously collecting GUI data with minimal annotation costs, improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with acquiring GUI data for desktop applications or newly launched websites, which impacts personalization and adaptation in MLLMs.

Method: The paper proposes Auto-Explorer, an autonomous tool for parsing and exploring GUI environments, with the UIXplore benchmark to evaluate exploration quality and fine-tuning MLLMs using gathered data.

Result: Experiments show Auto-Explorer efficiently collects GUI data to optimize MLLMs for new software environments, displaying superior performance.

Conclusion: Auto-Explorer is a promising method for rapid data collection and adaptation in GUI-based MLLMs, enhancing their efficiency in new contexts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in GUI agents have significantly expanded their ability to interpret natural language commands to manage software interfaces. However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software.

### [34] [MONICA: Real-Time Monitoring and Calibration of Chain-of-Thought Sycophancy in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06419)
*Jingyu Hu,Shu Yang,Xilin Gong,Hongming Wang,Weiru Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes MONICA, a novel framework to monitor and mitigate sycophantic behavior in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) at intermediate reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing with misinformation and undermining reliability. Monitoring this behavior during reasoning processes is necessary, as existing methods focus only on final answers.

Method: MONICA introduces a monitor for real-time sycophantic drift scoring during response generation and a calibrator to suppress sycophantic tendencies when scores exceed thresholds.

Result: Experimental evaluations on 12 datasets and 3 LRMs show MONICA reduces sycophancy in intermediate steps and final answers, significantly improving model reliability.

Conclusion: MONICA successfully mitigates sycophantic behavior, offering a robust solution for enhancing the reasoning reliability of LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR) introduces a novel geometric approach to improve calibration in chain-of-thought reasoning for LLMs, outperforming current methods in uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of poor calibration and overconfidence in Large Language Model predictions, which is critical for deploying these models safely. Current methods fail to provide reliable confidence estimates during complex multi-step reasoning.

Method: EDTR combines Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification with topological analysis. It uses reasoning paths' geometric clustering properties and topological risk features to assess confidence levels accurately.

Result: EDTR demonstrates 41% better calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods across varied benchmarks, achieving an impressive composite score of 0.672. It showcases perfect accuracy on olympiad-level mathematics (AIME) and exceptional calibration on grade school math (GSM8K).

Conclusion: The method offers a robust framework to quantify uncertainty in multi-step reasoning tasks, enhancing confidence reliability. EDTR facilitates safer LLM deployment by mitigating overconfidence and improving calibration.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

### [36] [Brain-Inspired Planning for Better Generalization in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06470)
*Mingde "Harry" Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges RL systems face in generalizing to real-world scenarios and introduces methods inspired by human reasoning to improve systematic generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to tackle the poor generalization capabilities of Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems in environments different from their training conditions.

Method: Three key approaches were introduced: top-down attention mechanism for spatial abstraction, the Skipper framework for task decomposition, and a feasibility evaluator to address delusional planning behaviors.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrated significant improvements in systematic generalization, robustness against distribution shifts, and better safety measures in planning agents.

Conclusion: Incorporating human-inspired reasoning into RL systems enhances generalization and planning abilities, with suggestions for future research in general task abstraction and abstract planning.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems encounter significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios, primarily due to poor generalization across environments that differ from their training conditions. This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call "spatial abstraction". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.

### [37] [GHOST: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem on Graphs of Convex Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06471)
*Jingtao Tang,Hang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduction of GHOST framework to optimally solve a new variant of Traveling Salesman Problem (GCS-TSP) focused on trajectory planning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical TSP methods fail in scenarios where edge costs depend on trajectories through convex regions. This necessitates the development of new methods for complex trajectory planning.

Method: GHOST integrates hierarchical search combining combinatorial tour exploration and convex trajectory optimization. It employs an abstract-path-unfolding algorithm for efficient lower-bound exploration, reducing unnecessary computations.

Result: The GHOST framework is proven to guarantee optimal solutions. It significantly outperforms other baseline methods for trajectory planning tasks and is adaptable for time-critical scenarios.

Conclusion: GHOST efficiently addresses trajectory-based TSP, offering strong optimality guarantees and practical performance benefits in complex planning setups.

Abstract: We study GCS-TSP, a new variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) defined over a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) -- a powerful representation for trajectory planning that decomposes the configuration space into convex regions connected by a sparse graph. In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes GRAPH-GRPO-LEX framework to convert legal contracts into semantic graphs using reinforcement learning-based LLMs for efficient contract review and analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual contract drafting and examination are challenging, error-prone due to complex document structures and semantics, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: The paper develops an ontology for mapping contract elements to graph entities and integrates reinforcement learning with GRPO in a Large Language Model for extracting entities and relationships.

Result: The framework identifies clause relationships and hidden dependencies in contracts automatically, showing improved segmentation and extraction accuracy.

Conclusion: By transforming contracts into semantic graphs, the proposed framework enhances contract analysis, introduces dynamic visualization, and prepares for contract linting akin to software engineering practices.

Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

TL;DR: FractalBench is introduced to evaluate AI systems' ability to synthesize fractal programs from images. Results show most models generate valid Python code but struggle to capture mathematical structures, especially in complex recursive patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether multimodal AI systems can abstract symbolic mathematical rules from visual patterns, focusing on synthesizing fractal generating programs.

Method: The benchmark, FractalBench, involves requiring multimodal AI models to generate executable Python code to recreate fractals from images and then evaluating their capability for mathematical reasoning.

Result: Of the evaluated models, 76% produce valid syntax but only 4% accurately capture fractal mathematical structures. Success rates vary based on geometric complexity, indicating gaps in mathematical abstraction abilities.

Conclusion: FractalBench exposes limitations in visual-mathematical reasoning of multimodal AI systems, serving as a diagnostic benchmark. It is available for further exploration and research.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench

*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Daniel Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a technique that trains AI systems to admit to mistakes and hidden objectives, improving their honesty and allowing harmful misaligned objectives to be detected with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems capable of complex tasks can pursue harmful objectives, and current interrogation methods fail as models can lie. A more effective way to ensure honest reporting in AI is needed.

Method: The authors propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit factual errors. They then test if this extends to admitting hidden misaligned objectives, particularly in adversarial settings.

Result: SRFT-trained models confessed hidden objectives under interrogation with an F1 score of 0.98, compared to a baseline model scoring 0. Additionally, SRFT models revealed up to 100% of hidden objective details, far surpassing baseline models.

Conclusion: SRFT is effective in improving the honesty of AI systems and detecting hidden misaligned objectives, providing a vital tool for ensuring safer AI behavior in complex tasks.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable of complex agentic tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machines struggle with tasks requiring intuitive physics compared to humans, highlighting the need for biologically inspired computational principles.

Method: The proposed Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN) uses unified representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, governed by Hebbian principles across 'What' and 'How' pathways.

Result: SRNN achieves competitive performance on CLEVRER benchmark, uncovers benchmark bias, proposes holistic evaluation methods, and facilitates error diagnosis.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility of converting biological intelligence into artificial systems for improved intuitive physics understanding and linguistic integration.

Abstract: Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and \textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'MathSE,' a self-evolving framework for enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in complex mathematical reasoning tasks. It outperforms prior models on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the limitations of MLLMs in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving, and the shortcomings of static, teacher-derived fine-tuning datasets.

Method: Introduced 'MathSE,' a framework that iteratively refines MLLMs through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. It integrates reasoning paths from previous iterations and uses an Outcome Reward Model (ORM) to guide improvement.

Result: MathSE achieved significant performance improvements over existing models and surpassed the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model, QVQ, on a challenging MathVL-test benchmark.

Conclusion: The iterative refinement approach (MathSE) enables MLLMs to generalize and adapt better to complex reasoning tasks, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recognizing emotions in conversation, particularly in capturing explicit and implicit emotions, enhancing natural human-computer interaction.

Method: Introduced PRC-Emo framework involving (1) emotion-sensitive prompts, (2) a demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, and (3) curriculum-based training for better emotional understanding, leveraging LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets, showing superior emotion recognition capabilities in conversational contexts.

Conclusion: The PRC-Emo framework effectively improves LLMs' emotional understanding, demonstrating its generalizability and potential to enhance ERC tasks.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets-- IEMOCAP and MELD --show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based emotional understanding.

Conclusion: This framework effectively improves urban region representation, proving robust and efficient through extended experiments.

Abstract: Region representation learning plays a pivotal role in urban computing by extracting meaningful features from unlabeled urban data. Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.

*Fei Zhao,Chonggang Lu,Haofu Qian,Fangcheng Shi,Zijie Meng,Jianzhao Huang,Xu Tang,Zheyong Xie,Zheyu Ye,Zhe Xu,Yao Hu,Shaosheng Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RedOne 2.0, a specialized large language model (LLM) that addresses challenges in social networking scenarios like slang, cultural diversity, and distribution shifts. It achieves this through a three-stage progressive post-training paradigm and demonstrates improved performance and data efficiency over its predecessors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve LLMs for social networking services, tackling challenges such as heterogeneous workloads, rapidly changing content norms, multilingual corpora, and distribution shifts.

Method: The method includes a three-stage post-training pipeline: (1) Exploratory Learning to align and identify weaknesses, (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning to address specific gaps while preventing forgetting, and (3) Refinement Learning using RL to stabilize and balance task performance.

Result: RedOne 2.0 delivers significant performance improvements with an average gain of about 2.41 over a 7B baseline and a substantial lift of 8.74 compared to its initial version. It achieves these gains with superior data efficiency, requiring less training data.

Conclusion: RedOne 2.0 provides a competitive, cost-efficient solution for domain-specific large language models tailored to social networking services, improving capabilities while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, social networking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve AI explainability by integrating LLMs into standardized decision models, transforming opaque reasoning into transparent decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance explainability in AI by addressing limitations of traditional methods that focus on post-hoc interpretation and feature attribution.

Method: The method involves embedding LLMs into formal decision models such as QOC, Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management, coupled with a layered architecture separating LLM reasoning and explainable processes.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to replicate human-level decision logic across decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: LLM-driven structured processes can enable reliable, interpretable, and auditable AI-supported decision-making.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to increasing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) within standardized analytical processes. While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The results suggest that LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular pipeline combining explainable AI and deterministic tools to mimic structured expert workflows in decision support tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a decision-support system with transparent reasoning and traceable outputs, overcoming the opaque nature of traditional AI models.

Method: The pipeline leverages three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model, normal-form games, and sequential games, with adjustable modules integrating LLMs and deterministic analysis.

Result: In a logistics test case, the system achieved moderate human alignment (55.5%-62.9%) and role agreement (57%) across multiple factors, with LLM evaluations matching human standards.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that LLM-driven pipelines can emulate expert processes while maintaining transparency and auditability.

Abstract: We present a modular, explainable LLM-agent pipeline for decision support that externalizes reasoning into auditable artifacts. The system instantiates three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model (factor set, signed impact matrix, systemic roles, feedback loops); normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria); and sequential games (role-conditioned agents, tree construction, backward induction), with swappable modules at every step. LLM components (default: GPT-5) are paired with deterministic analyzers for equilibria and matrix-based role classification, yielding traceable intermediates rather than opaque outputs. In a real-world logistics case (100 runs), mean factor alignment with a human baseline was 55.5\% over 26 factors and 62.9\% on the transport-core subset; role agreement over matches was 57\%. An LLM judge using an eight-criterion rubric (max 100) scored runs on par with a reconstructed human baseline. Configurable LLM pipelines can thus mimic expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a comprehensive approach to measure and reduce the environmental impacts of AI systems across their lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for assessing AI's environmental burdens lack comparability, reproducibility, and complete coverage of impact dimensions such as water usage and value chain effects.

Method: The paper establishes a unified Green AI definition, maps a five-phase lifecycle to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), specifies PDCA governance cycles, suggests hardware and system-level strategies, and integrates calibrated measurement frameworks for consistent comparisons.

Result: The approach allows for quantifiable, provider-agnostic assessments of AI environmental impacts and identifies actionable strategies for reduction.

Conclusion: By addressing energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts across the AI lifecycle, the paper provides guidance to make AI system assessments more transparent and sustainable.

Abstract: Across the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle - from hardware to development, deployment, and reuse - burdens span energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts. Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

*Meghyn Bienvenu,Quentin Manière*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted DL knowledge bases under cost-based semantics, extending its scope to DLs with inverse roles and role inclusions, including DL-Lite dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand the complexities and computational implications of querying inconsistent knowledge bases using cost-based semantics in description logics.

Method: The method assigns costs to interpretations based on violated axioms and assertions, and analyzes query answers using optimal or bounded-cost interpretations. The paper expands the analysis to more expressive DLs.

Result: The complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics is precisely determined, improving lower bounds. It identifies cases (e.g., DL-Lite dialect with fixed cost bounds) where query answers can be computed efficiently with first-order rewriting and minimal data complexity ($\mathsf{TC}_0$).

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding of cost-based semantics in DLs, showing it is computationally efficient under specific frameworks, contrary to prior views that considered it intractable.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic (DL) knowledge bases under recently-introduced cost-based semantics. In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ and $\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\text{DL-Lite}^\mathcal{H}_\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\mathsf{TC}_0$).

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework to assess sustainability impacts of AI in document-intensive supply chain workflows, comparing manual, AI-assisted, and advanced agentic AI approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sustainability and automation challenges in AI-driven document workflows and measure their environmental impacts.

Method: The paper contrasts manual workflows with AI-assisted and agentic AI setups using empirical data on energy, carbon emissions, and water usage.

Result: AI-assisted and agentic AI workflows reduce environmental impacts by 70-98%. Advanced AI configurations improve sustainability despite increased resource usage compared to simpler AI setups.

Conclusion: Utilizing advanced AI workflows significantly boosts sustainability in supply chain document operations, integrating ESG metrics and replicability for real-world application.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for document intelligence within supply chain operations, centered on agentic artificial intelligence (AI). We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight and efficient PLGF architecture and DualFocal Loss function to overcome computational and performance challenges in urban flow inference, achieving state-of-the-art results with a significant reduction in model size and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve urban flow inference for better traffic management and resource allocation by addressing issues like high computational cost and poor performance on skewed data distribution.

Method: The method combines the PLGF architecture, which uses Progressive Local-Global Fusion for detail and context analysis, and DualFocal Loss for adaptive optimization in difficult-to-predict areas.

Result: PLGF achieves a model size reduction of up to 97% with accuracy improvement over 10% against strong baselines, validated across 4 real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed PLGF architecture and DualFocal Loss function provide an efficient and scalable solution for fine-grained urban flow inference, setting a new benchmark for performance and model efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-grained urban flow inference is crucial for urban planning and intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise traffic management and resource allocation. However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF.

*Junji Hou,Junzhou Zhao,Shuo Zhang,Pinghui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to distinguish synthetic time series data generated by large models (TSLMs) using a novel concept called uncertainty contraction. The approach consistently outperforms existing detection methods across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the increasing risks associated with the misuse and fabrication of synthetic data, particularly time series, which require new detection methods due to differences in modality compared to text.

Method: The authors propose the contraction hypothesis, supported by theoretical proofs and empirical validation, and develop the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a method that measures uncertainty changes under recursive forecasting to detect synthetic time series.

Result: The proposed UCE method is validated through experiments on 32 diverse datasets, demonstrating high performance compared to existing detection baselines.

Conclusion: UCE is a reliable and generalizable solution for identifying synthetic time series generated by TSLMs, addressing the unique challenges posed by this data modality.

Abstract: Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.

*Liang Shan,Kaicheng Shen,Wen Wu,Zhenyu Ying,Chaochao Lu,Guangze Ye,Liang He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MENTOR, a self-evolving framework to mitigate implicit risks in LLMs using metacognitive self-assessment and dynamic rule generation, improving safety and domain alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often fail to address implicit, domain-specific risks and lack an effective mechanism applicable across specialized fields.

Method: MENTOR hosts a metacognitive self-assessment tool for value alignment, a dataset of 9,000 domain-specific queries, dynamic rule generation through knowledge graphs, and activation steering during inference.

Result: MENTOR effectively reduces semantic attack rates and provides thorough value alignment analysis. Its metacognitive assessment closely matches human evaluation in educational, financial, and management domains.

Conclusion: MENTOR offers an efficient mechanism to uncover and self-mitigate implicit risks in LLMs by employing metacognitive strategies while overcoming limitations of static and human-intensive approaches.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and value alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment. Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a framework for leveraging LLMs in market-making with improved efficiency through knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The slow inference speed of LLMs when applied to market-making in financial trading limits their practical usability.

Method: The authors propose using a normalized fluorescent probe to study LLM features, develop the CMM framework to decouple LLM features across layer, task, and data dimensions, and use an Hájek-MoE to integrate knowledge from student models in a common feature space.

Result: Experiments on four real-world market datasets show that CMM outperforms existing distillation methods and RL-based strategies for market-making.

Conclusion: CMM provides an advanced, efficient approach to market-making by leveraging LLMs and cooperative knowledge distillation, demonstrating superior performance and practicality in financial contexts.

Abstract: Market making (MM) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has attracted significant attention in financial trading. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance knowledge discovery in sensor signal-based time series classification by identifying latent subclasses.

Method: Gradient-based saliency maps are generated from trained neural networks, followed by clustering and symbolic approximation using large language models (LLMs) for subclass discovery.

Result: The proposed method surpasses signal-only baselines in clustering and latent subclass identification performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Employing saliency maps and LLM-driven symbolic reasoning improves subclass identification in multiclass time-series classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for sensor signal-based knowledge discovery, focusing on identifying latent subclasses in time series classification tasks. The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle the unclear effectiveness of content moderation strategies in OSNs due to challenges in data collection and experimental control.

Method: They designed an LLM-powered simulator replicating human-like OSN interactions, allowing controlled, counterfactual experiments on toxic behaviors influenced by moderation interventions.

Result: Experiments showed realistic social behavior in simulations, the emergence of social contagion phenomena, and the superiority of personalized moderation strategies.

Conclusion: Harnessing LLMs for simulating OSN interactions offers a promising avenue for evaluating and improving moderation strategies effectively.

Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) widely adopt content moderation to mitigate the spread of abusive and toxic discourse. Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.

TL;DR: PADiff, a diffusion-based approach, is proposed to handle ad hoc teamwork (AHT), which involves collaborating with unseen teammates. It performs better than existing methods in diverse cooperation scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ad hoc teamwork requires agents to adapt to and collaborate with unknown teammates in real-time, a critical need for real-world applications. Current RL-based approaches fail to capture the variety of cooperation patterns required for success.

Method: This paper introduces PADiff, a diffusion-based policy that overcomes conventional issues by integrating predictive information about teammates into its denoising process to adapt in non-stationary environments.

Result: PADiff demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing methods across various cooperation environments in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: PADiff effectively addresses the core challenge of ad hoc teamwork by utilizing a diffusion-based approach, providing superior multimodal adaptability and success in dynamic teamwork scenarios.

Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.

TL;DR: The paper presents AgenticSciML, a system where over ten AI agents collaboratively generate and improve SciML solutions, outperforming traditional human-designed methods in tasks like physics-informed learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the expert-driven, labor-intensive process of designing SciML architectures, loss functions, and training strategies by leveraging multi-agent collaboration for efficient and innovative discovery.

Method: The authors developed a framework involving over ten AI agents equipped with structured debate, retrieval-augmented memory, and evolutionary search to collaboratively propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions.

Result: AgenticSciML achieves significant advancements in performance, with solutions surpassing human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction while introducing novel, effective methodologies.

Conclusion: Collaborative multi-agent reasoning produces innovative and efficient solutions in SciML, highlighting the potential for scalable and autonomous scientific discovery through such frameworks.

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates data-driven inference with physical modeling to solve complex problems in science and engineering. However, the design of SciML architectures, loss formulations, and training strategies remains an expert-driven research process, requiring extensive experimentation and problem-specific insights. Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

*Chen Han,Yijia Ma,Jin Tan,Wenzhen Zheng,Xijin Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes ED2D, an evidence-based multi-agent debate framework for misinformation detection and correction, comparing its effectiveness with human-authored debunking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation detection frameworks lack emphasis on transparency and user understanding, limiting their ability to correct user beliefs and prevent future misinformation sharing.

Method: The ED2D framework enhances multi-agent debate systems by integrating factual evidence retrieval and developing persuasive debunking transcripts to mitigate misinformation.

Result: ED2D outperformed baselines in misinformation detection benchmarks and its transcripts showed persuasive effects similar to human experts, though incorrect predictions could reinforce misconceptions.

Conclusion: ED2D demonstrates potential in misinformation intervention but also highlights risks when misclassification occurs. A community website was developed for fostering transparency and collaborative fact-checking.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) frameworks have emerged as promising approaches for misinformation detection by simulating adversarial reasoning. While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IterResearch introduces an iterative deep-research paradigm for long-horizon reasoning with strategic workspace reconstruction, achieving significant performance gains over current agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-research agents face challenges in long-horizon reasoning due to single expanded context windows, which overload information and limit task efficacy.

Method: IterResearch designs research as a Markov Decision Process, using evolving memory reports and periodic synthesis, combined with Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO) for exploration and stable training.

Result: Experiments show +14.5pp improvement over open-source agents across six benchmarks, excellent interaction scaling, and effectiveness in prompting frontier models with up to 19.2pp improvement.

Conclusion: IterResearch is a versatile and scalable solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective for both training and augmenting model performance in deep-research tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources. However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.

*Zhen Wang,Yufan Zhou,Zhongyan Luo,Lyumanshan Ye,Adam Wood,Man Yao,Luoshang Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEEPPERSONA, a method to create highly detailed synthetic personas for AI research and personalization, outperforming prior models in quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic personas lack depth and fail to capture the complexity of real human identities, limiting their utility in simulation, personalization, and alignment research.

Method: It uses a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method: (1) building a large, hierarchically organized human-attribute taxonomy, and (2) generating detailed personas with hundreds of attributes via progressive attribute sampling.

Result: DEEPPERSONA shows a 32% improvement in attribute diversity, 44% in profile uniqueness, boosts AI question-answering accuracy by 11.6%, and narrows AI-human behavior gaps in social and personality metrics.

Conclusion: DEEPPERSONA presents a scalable, privacy-preserving approach for generating realistic human personas, advancing AI personalization and behavioral simulation research.

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

Result: DigiData offers greater diversity and complexity in goals, while new evaluation protocols address deficiencies in conventional metrics.

Conclusion: DigiData and DigiData-Bench advance mobile control agent development to improve user interaction with digital devices.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces optimizations for sparse hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to improve energy and area efficiency in intracranial EEG seizure detection using compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplified operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enhance energy and area efficiency for implantable devices performing seizure detection, addressing limitations of dense and sparse HDC implementations.

Method: The paper introduces compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies spatial bundling in sparse HDC while optimizing hyperparameters for better detection delay.

Result: The optimized approach achieves 1.73x more energy and 2.20x more area efficiency compared to naive sparse HDC implementation, and 7.50x more energy and 3.24x more area efficiency compared to dense HDC.

Conclusion: Sparse HDC with introduced optimizations provides significant benefits in energy efficiency, area efficiency, and detection delay, enabling smaller and longer-lasting brain implants.

Abstract: Implantable devices for reliable intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) require efficient, accurate, and real-time detection of seizures. Dense hyperdimensional computing (HDC) proves to be efficient over neural networks; however, it still consumes considerable switching power for an ultra-low energy application. Sparse HDC, on the other hand, has the potential of further reducing the energy consumption, yet at the expense of having to support more complex operations and introducing an extra hyperparameter, the maximum hypervector density. To improve the energy and area efficiency of the sparse HDC operations, this work introduces the compressed item memory (CompIM) and simplifies the spatial bundling. We also analyze how a proper hyperparameter choice improves the detection delay compared to dense HDC. Ultimately, our optimizations achieve a 1.73x more energy- and 2.20x more area-efficient hardware design than the naive sparse implementation. We are also 7.50x more energy- and 3.24x more area-efficient than the dense HDC implementation. This work highlights the hardware advantages of sparse HDC, demonstrating its potential to enable smaller brain implants with a substantially extended battery life compared to the current state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges in modeling yield-impacting failure mechanisms during Cu-Cu hybrid bonding for dense and reliable chiplet integrations.

Method: YAP+ incorporates factors like overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and pad density into an open-source yield simulator. It facilitates pad layout-aware yield analysis and investigates pad layout impacts.

Result: The framework achieves high simulation accuracy with a significant 1,000x speedup in runtime, enabling efficient co-optimization of packaging, design rules, and system-level strategies.

Conclusion: YAP+ is a valuable tool for exploring hybrid bonding impacts, optimizing pad designs, and improving system efficiency in 3D integrations.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) integration continues to advance Moore's Law by facilitating dense interconnects and enabling multi-tier system architectures. Among the various integration approaches, Cu-Cu hybrid bonding has emerged as a leading solution for achieving high interconnect density in chiplet integration. In this work, we present YAP+, a yield modeling framework specifically tailored for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding processes. YAP+ incorporates a comprehensive set of yield-impacting failure mechanisms, including overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and Cu pad density. Furthermore, YAP+ supports pad layout-aware yield analysis, considering critical, redundant, and dummy pads across arbitrary 2D physical layout patterns. To support practical evaluation, we developed an open-source yield simulator, demonstrating that our near-analytical model matches simulation accuracy while achieving over 1,000x speedup in runtime. This performance makes YAP+ a valuable tool for co-optimizing packaging technologies, assembly design rules, and system-level design strategies. Beyond W2W-D2W comparisons, we leverage YAP+ to investigate the impact of pad layout patterns, bonding pitch, and pad ratios across different pad types, and explore the benefits of strategically placing redundant pad replicas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in the resolution and accuracy of FPGA-based TDCs while minimizing hardware overhead, improving the usability and scalability of these systems for high-precision time measurement applications.

Method: The proposed approach introduces two new methods: Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) to recover usable time bins by analyzing code density data and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) to merge multiple delay chains for scalable and precise resolution without averaging.

Result: The TDC achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, DNL of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and INL of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB, outperforming existing architectures with lower hardware overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed TDC with POR and ITI methods delivers high precision, competitive performance, and reduced hardware complexity, demonstrating broad applicability in precise timing and delay calibration on FPGA platforms.

Abstract: We present a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) implemented on a 16 nm Xilinx UltraScale Plus FPGA that achieves a resolution of 1.15 ps, RMS precision of 3.38 ps, a differential nonlinearity (DNL) of [-0.43, 0.24] LSB, and an integral nonlinearity (INL) of [-2.67, 0.15] LSB. This work introduces two novel hardware-independent post-processing techniques - Partial Order Reconstruction (POR) and Iterative Time-bin Interleaving (ITI) - that significantly enhance the performance of FPGA-based TDCs. POR addresses the missing code problem by inferring the partial order of each time bin through code density test data and directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis, enabling near-complete recovery of usable bins. ITI further improves fine time resolution by merging multiple calibrated tapped delay lines (TDLs) into a single unified delay chain, achieving scalable resolution without resorting to averaging. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA-based TDC architectures, the proposed methods deliver competitive or superior performance with reduced hardware overhead. These techniques are broadly applicable to high-resolution time measurement and precise delay calibration in programmable logic platforms.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of efficient single-batch inference in LLMs for on-device intelligence by utilizing the benefits of FPGA accelerators, amidst optimized GPU competition.

Method: The approach involves switching LLM inference from arithmetic- to memory-based computation using table lookups, employing techniques like activation-weight co-quantization and bandwidth-efficient designs implemented on AMD V80 FPGAs.

Result: LUT-LLM provides 1.66x lower latency and 1.72x higher energy efficiency than top GPUs like AMD MI210 and NVIDIA A100, with scalability to large 32B models delivering a 2.16x efficiency gain.

Conclusion: The proposed FPGA-based LUT-LLM demonstrates significant advantages in latency and energy efficiency, making it highly competitive for scaling larger LLMs in practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has advanced numerous applications, yet efficient single-batch inference remains vital for on-device intelligence. While FPGAs offer fine-grained data control and high energy efficiency, recent GPU optimizations have narrowed their advantage, especially under arithmetic-based computation. To overcome this, we leverage FPGAs' abundant on-chip memory to shift LLM inference from arithmetic- to memory-based computation through table lookups. We present LUT-LLM, the first FPGA accelerator enabling 1B+ LLM inference via vector-quantized memory operations. Our analysis identifies activation-weight co-quantization as the most effective scheme, supported by (1) bandwidth-aware parallel centroid search, (2) efficient 2D table lookups, and (3) a spatial-temporal hybrid design minimizing data caching. Implemented on an AMD V80 FPGA for a customized Qwen 3 1.7B model, LUT-LLM achieves 1.66x lower latency than AMD MI210 and 1.72x higher energy efficiency than NVIDIA A100, scaling to 32B models with 2.16x efficiency gain over A100.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), a novel method to mitigate lateral charge spreading (LCS)-induced retention errors in modern 3D NAND flash SSDs, improving reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increased capacity in 3D NAND flash memory has introduced reliability issues like lateral charge spreading (LCS), causing retention errors over time. Addressing this can extend SSD lifetime and improve performance.

Method: The paper introduces STAR, a data randomizer targeting weak data patterns responsible for errors from LCS. STAR uses optimization schemes for efficient integration into SSD controllers with minimal timing overhead.

Result: Experimental evaluation using a STAR-aware SSD emulator showed STAR enhances SSD lifetime by up to 2.3x and reduces read latency by 50% compared to traditional SSDs.

Conclusion: STAR effectively addresses retention errors caused by LCS in 3D NAND flash memory, improving reliability, extending SSD lifetime, and boosting performance with negligible addition to existing workflows.

Abstract: Although NAND flash memory has achieved continuous capacity improvements via advanced 3D stacking and multi-level cell technologies, these innovations introduce new reliability challenges, par- ticularly lateral charge spreading (LCS), absent in low-capacity 2D flash memory. Since LCS significantly increases retention errors over time, addressing this problem is essential to ensure the lifetime of modern SSDs employing high-capacity 3D flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel data randomizer, STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), which proactively eliminates the majority of weak data patterns responsible for retention errors caused by LCS. Unlike existing techniques that target only specific worst-case patterns, STAR effectively removes a broad spectrum of weak patterns, significantly enhancing reliability against LCS. By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR improves SSD lifetime by up to 2.3x and reduces read latency by an average of 50% on real-world traces compared to conventional SSDs

Motivation: Existing methods for MXMAC integer and floating-point accumulation face inefficiency due to costly conversions and quantization losses, necessitating a solution for better efficiency in continual learning applications.

Method: A hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MXMAC is proposed to combine integer accumulation with floating-point precision. The approach integrates this design into the SNAX NPU platform, optimizing the overall efficiency of mixed-precision processing.

Result: The system achieves high energy efficiency: 657 GOPS/W for MXINT8, 1438-1675 GOPS/W for MXFP8/6, and 4065 GOPS/W for MXFP4, with corresponding high throughput values.

Conclusion: Efficient control and data transfer with optimized mixed-precision accumulation architecture improves continual learning operations in NPUs, achieving significant energy and throughput benchmarks.

Abstract: Emerging continual learning applications necessitate next-generation neural processing unit (NPU) platforms to support both training and inference operations. The promising Microscaling (MX) standard enables narrow bit-widths for inference and large dynamic ranges for training. However, existing MX multiply-accumulate (MAC) designs face a critical trade-off: integer accumulation requires expensive conversions from narrow floating-point products, while FP32 accumulation suffers from quantization losses and costly normalization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid precision-scalable reduction tree for MX MACs that combines the benefits of both approaches, enabling efficient mixed-precision accumulation with controlled accuracy relaxation. Moreover, we integrate an 8x8 array of these MACs into the state-of-the-art (SotA) NPU integration platform, SNAX, to provide efficient control and data transfer to our optimized precision-scalable MX datapath. We evaluate our design both on MAC and system level and compare it to the SotA. Our integrated system achieves an energy efficiency of 657, 1438-1675, and 4065 GOPS/W, respectively, for MXINT8, MXFP8/6, and MXFP4, with a throughput of 64, 256, and 512 GOPS.

Motivation: To enhance data center performance by optimizing fundamental shared functions called tax components, particularly in widely used microservices like MongoDB.

Method: The authors profiled MongoDB using the DeathStarBench benchmark suite to identify underlying tax components and microarchitectural effects, providing observations for offloading specific components.

Result: Insights were gained into the microarchitectural behavior of MongoDB's tax components, highlighting opportunities for offloading to improve performance.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that identifying and offloading specific tax components can optimize MongoDB performance, aiding broader data center workload efficiency.

Abstract: The data centers of today are running diverse workloads sharing many common lower level functions called tax components. Any optimization to any tax component will lead to performance improvements across the data center fleet. Typically, performance enhancements in tax components are achieved by offloading them to accelerators, however, it is not practical to offload every tax component. The goal of this paper is to identify opportunities to offload more than one tax component together. We focus on MongoDB which is a common microservice used in a large number of applications in the datacenter. We profile MongoDB running as part of the DeathStarBench benchmark suite, identifying its tax components and their microarchitectural implications. We make observations and suggestions based on the inferences made to offload a few of the tax components in this application.

Existing neural processing unit (NPU) simulators focus on matrix computations with simple double-buffered on-chip memory systems, lacking the modeling capability for realistic embedding behavior. Next-generation NPUs, however, call for more flexible on-chip memory architectures that can support diverse access and management schemes required by embedding workloads. To enable flexible exploration and design of emerging NPU architectures, we present EONSim, an NPU simulator that holistically models both matrix and embedding vector operations. EONSim integrates a validated performance model for matrix computations with detailed memory simulation for embedding accesses, supporting various on-chip memory management policies.

As FPGA adoption grows, research into task scheduling and preemption techniques has intensified. However, the field lacks a standardized benchmarking framework for consistent and reproducible evaluation. Many existing studies propose innovative scheduling or preemption mechanisms but often rely on proprietary or synthetic benchmarks, limiting generalizability and making comparison difficult. This methodical fragmentation hinders effective evaluation of scheduling strategies and preemption in multi-tenant FPGA environments.
  This paper presents the first open-source preemption-enabled benchmark suite for evaluating FPGA preemption strategies and testing new scheduling algorithms, without requiring users to create preemption workloads from scratch. The suite includes 27 diverse applications spanning cryptography, AI/ML, computation-intensive workloads, communication systems, and multimedia processing. Each benchmark integrates comprehensive context-saving and restoration mechanisms, facilitating reproducible research and consistent comparisons.

Novel sparsity-optimized hybrid PIM architecture and inference-time software optimizations greatly reduce energy consumption while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spiking neural networks (SNNs) integrated with transformers face architectural mismatches with conventional hardware, making their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices challenging. Existing neuromorphic and PIM accelerators are inadequate for handling high sparsity and complex operations of such models.

Method: A hybrid analog-digital PIM architecture is designed with input sparsity optimizations and data-flow enhancements to minimize memory access overhead. Additional software optimizations, such as layer skipping and timestep reduction via Bayesian Optimization, are proposed for efficient co-exploration of algorithm-microarchitectural spaces.

Conclusion: This work introduces an efficient, low-power hardware solution enabling spiking transformers for real-time visual reasoning in edge AI systems, advancing the potential of bio-inspired computation under computational constraints.

Abstract: The integration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with transformer-based architectures has opened new opportunities for bio-inspired low-power, event-driven visual reasoning on edge devices. However, the high temporal resolution and binary nature of spike-driven computation introduce architectural mismatches with conventional digital hardware (CPU/GPU). Prior neuromorphic and Processing-in-Memory (PIM) accelerators struggle with high sparsity and complex operations prevalent in such models. To address these challenges, we propose a memory-centric hardware accelerator tailored for spiking transformers, optimized for deployment in real-time event-driven frameworks such as classification with both static and event-based input frames. Our design leverages a hybrid analog-digital PIM architecture with input sparsity optimizations, and a custom-designed dataflow to minimize memory access overhead and maximize data reuse under spatiotemporal sparsity, for compute and memory-efficient end-to-end execution of spiking transformers. We subsequently propose inference-time software optimizations for layer skipping, and timestep reduction, leveraging Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to perform robust, efficient co-exploration of the joint algorithmic-microarchitectural design spaces under tight computational budgets. Evaluated on both image(ImageNet) and event-based (CIFAR-10 DVS, DVSGesture) classification, the accelerator achieves up to ~467x and ~1.86x energy reduction compared to edge GPU (Jetson Orin Nano) and previous PIM accelerators for spiking transformers, while maintaining competitive task accuracy on ImageNet dataset.

*Yuzong Chen,Chao Fang,Xilai Dai,Yuheng Wu,Thierry Tambe,Marian Verhelst,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator, that employs hybrid numerical formats and lightweight PIM compute units to enhance large language model (LLM) inference with improved quantization efficiency and speedups compared to state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face challenges in memory bandwidth and computational demands, making efficient LLM inference difficult. Current solutions combining NPUs and DRAM-based PIM face limitations due to high-precision PIM compute units causing significant area and power overhead.

Method: The paper introduces a threefold approach: (1) a mixed-precision quantization scheme leveraging hybrid numerical formats for high compression efficiency, (2) a co-designed PIM accelerator with lightweight compute units to boost throughput under area constraints, and (3) low-precision dataflow optimization using operator fusion to reduce runtime dequantization overhead.

Result: P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy for both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. It delivers average speedups of 4.9×, 2.0×, and 3.4× over HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba accelerators, respectively.

Conclusion: P3-LLM provides an efficient solution for LLM inference, combining innovative quantization with an optimized PIM architecture for improved computational performance and memory efficiency, setting a benchmark for future LLM acceleration strategies.

Abstract: The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demand of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively.

### [76] [Optimizing GEMM for Energy and Performance on Versal ACAP Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06907)
*Ilias Papalamprou,Dimosthenis Masouros,Ioannis Loudaros,Francky Catthoor,Dimitrios Soudris*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for optimizing GEMM mappings on AMD's Versal ACAP using a Machine Learning model, achieving significant performance and energy efficiency improvements over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GEMM is a critical operation for various workloads but struggles with resource and power constraints in edge environments. AMD Versal ACAP's components can address these issues, but prior works fail to optimize energy-performance trade-offs.

Method: The framework employs a Machine Learning model trained on 6000 experiments of GEMM mappings to guide Design Space Exploration for optimized performance and energy efficiency.

Result: The proposed framework delivers geomean throughput improvements of 1.23x (up to 2.5x) and geomean energy efficiency improvements of 1.25x (up to 2.7x), outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that Machine Learning methods can successfully optimize GEMM mappings on Versal ACAP, balancing performance and energy efficiency for edge computing environments.

Abstract: General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a fundamental operation in many scientific workloads, signal processing, and particularly deep learning. It is often a bottleneck for performance and energy efficiency, especially in edge environments with tight resource and power constraints. AMD's Versal ACAP offers heterogeneous components (AIEs, PL, PS) that can address these challenges, but mapping GEMM across them is complex, with prior works largely overlooking energy-performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for Versal ACAP that generates GEMM mappings optimized for either performance or energy efficiency. Unlike prior analytical approaches, our method leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model, trained on approximately 6000 on-board experiments of different GEMM mappings, to guide Design Space Exploration, yielding more efficient designs. Evaluation on the Versal VCK190 shows geomean improvements of 1.23x (up to 2.5x) in throughput and 1.25x (up to 2.7x) in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art frameworks.

Abstract: Edge AI deployment faces critical challenges balancing computational performance, energy efficiency, and resource constraints. This paper presents FPGA-accelerated RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions for efficient neural network inference on resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a custom RISC-V core with four novel ISA extensions (FPGA.VCONV, FPGA.GEMM, FPGA.RELU, FPGA.CUSTOM) and integrated neural network accelerators, implemented and validated on the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 platform.

Hardware implementation closes timing with +12.793 ns worst negative slack at 50 MHz while using 0.43% LUTs and 11.4% BRAM for the base core and 38.8% DSPs when accelerators are active. Hardware verification confirms successful FPGA deployment with verified 64 KB BRAM memory interface and AXI interconnect functionality. All performance metrics are obtained from physical hardware measurements. This work establishes a reproducible framework for ISA-guided FPGA acceleration that complements fixed-function ASICs by trading peak performance for programmability.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates five LLM runtimes on Apple Silicon, comparing their efficiency and functionalities while highlighting trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze and compare Apple Silicon-based LLM runtimes and their performance characteristics for privacy-focused, on-device processing.

Method: Empirical evaluation of multiple frameworks (MLX, MLC-LLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, PyTorch MPS) on an M2 Ultra Mac system using benchmarks on Qwen-2.5 model; metrics include TTFT, throughput, latency, caching, quantization, and deployment.

Result: MLX leads in generation throughput; MLC-LLM excels in TTFT; llama.cpp efficient for single-stream, Ollama favors ergonomics but lags performance; PyTorch MPS limited by memory constraints.

Conclusion: Apple Silicon frameworks are rapidly evolving, offering viable privacy-focused solutions, though they remain weaker than NVIDIA GPU frameworks in absolute performance.

Abstract: We present a systematic, empirical evaluation of five local large language model (LLM) runtimes on Apple Silicon: MLX, MLC-LLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, and PyTorch MPS. Experiments were conducted on a Mac Studio equipped with an M2 Ultra processor and 192 GB of unified memory. Using the Qwen-2.5 model family across prompts ranging from a few hundred to 100,000 tokens, we measure time-to-first-token (TTFT), steady-state throughput, latency percentiles, long-context behavior (key-value and prompt caching), quantization support, streaming performance, batching and concurrency behavior, and deployment complexity.
  Under our settings, MLX achieves the highest sustained generation throughput, while MLC-LLM delivers consistently lower TTFT for moderate prompt sizes and offers stronger out-of-the-box inference features. llama.cpp is highly efficient for lightweight single-stream use, Ollama emphasizes developer ergonomics but lags in throughput and TTFT, and PyTorch MPS remains limited by memory constraints on large models and long contexts.
  All frameworks execute fully on-device with no telemetry, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. We release scripts, logs, and plots to reproduce all results. Our analysis clarifies the design trade-offs in Apple-centric LLM deployments and provides evidence-based recommendations for interactive and long-context processing. Although Apple Silicon inference frameworks still trail NVIDIA GPU-based systems such as vLLM in absolute performance, they are rapidly maturing into viable, production-grade solutions for private, on-device LLM inference.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MingTok-Audio, a unified continuous speech tokenizer, and foundational models Ming-UniAudio and Ming-UniAudio-Edit for advancing speech understanding, generation, and editing. It also provides open-source benchmarks for free-form speech editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech models struggle with discrepancies in token representations for understanding and generation, inhibiting effective speech editing. A unified approach is needed for better performance in these areas.

Method: The model leverages a novel continuous tokenizer, MingTok-Audio, which integrates semantic and acoustic features. It developed Ming-UniAudio for balanced performance and extends it to Ming-UniAudio-Edit for instruction-based speech editing without timestamp constraints.

Result: Ming-UniAudio achieved state-of-the-art records on ContextASR benchmark and a competitive performance in Chinese voice cloning. Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit benchmark was introduced to evaluate free-form speech editing capabilities.

Conclusion: The research successfully unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and offering open-source tools to enhance future developments in speech-related technologies.

Abstract: Existing speech models suffer from competing requirements on token representations by understanding and generation tasks. This discrepancy in representation prevents speech language models from performing instruction-based free-form editing. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel framework that unifies speech understanding, generation, and editing. The core of our unified model is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio, the first continuous tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, which makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks. Based on this unified continuous audio tokenizer, we developed the speech language model Ming-UniAudio, which achieved a balance between generation and understanding capabilities. Ming-UniAudio sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on 8 out of 12 metrics on the ContextASR benchmark. Notably, for Chinese voice cloning, it achieves a highly competitive Seed-TTS-WER of 0.95. Leveraging this foundational model, we further trained a dedicated speech editing model Ming-UniAudio-Edit, the first speech language model that enables universal, free-form speech editing guided solely by natural language instructions, handling both semantic and acoustic modifications without timestamp condition. To rigorously assess the editing capability and establish a foundation for future research, we introduce Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for instruction-based free-form speech editing, featuring diverse scenarios and evaluation dimensions spanning semantic correctness, acoustic quality, and instruction alignment. We open-sourced the continuous audio tokenizer, the unified foundational model, and the free-form instruction-based editing model to facilitate the development of unified audio understanding, generation, and manipulation.

*Myeongseob Ko,Nikhil Reddy Billa,Adam Nguyen,Charles Fleming,Ming Jin,Ruoxi Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a new method to extract memorized training data from large language models (LLMs) by maximizing model uncertainty, and achieves better results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data extraction methods for LLMs are limited in success and depth of understanding regarding memorization leakage, posing privacy and copyright issues. This paper aims to address these limitations systematically.

Method: The authors propose the Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA) framework, which uses entropy spikes to trigger model uncertainty and extract memorized data. Additionally, they introduce Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) for aligned LLMs to weaken alignment and increase vulnerability to attacks.

Result: The proposed methods outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data from various LLMs, even without prior knowledge of the training data.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant memorization risks in LLMs, presenting CIA as a more effective and methodical approach to analyzing these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The memorization of training data in large language models (LLMs) poses significant privacy and copyright concerns. Existing data extraction methods, particularly heuristic-based divergence attacks, often exhibit limited success and offer limited insight into the fundamental drivers of memorization leakage. This paper introduces Confusion-Inducing Attacks (CIA), a principled framework for extracting memorized data by systematically maximizing model uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that the emission of memorized text during divergence is preceded by a sustained spike in token-level prediction entropy. CIA leverages this insight by optimizing input snippets to deliberately induce this consecutive high-entropy state. For aligned LLMs, we further propose Mismatched Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to simultaneously weaken their alignment and induce targeted confusion, thereby increasing susceptibility to our attacks. Experiments on various unaligned and aligned LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attacks outperform existing baselines in extracting verbatim and near-verbatim training data without requiring prior knowledge of the training data. Our findings highlight persistent memorization risks across various LLMs and offer a more systematic method for assessing these vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using in-context learning with foundation models for content moderation, enabling privacy-preserving and adaptable moderation across various tasks like toxicity, spam, and sentiment detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing moderation systems are centralized, task-specific, and lack transparency, failing to account for diverse user preferences or decentralized environments.

Method: A framework leverages in-context learning with foundation models, allowing lightweight personalization without model retraining through prompt-based interventions.

Result: Foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, effective personalization with minimal examples, and robustness in handling real-world noisy data through augmented prompts.

Conclusion: This work establishes in-context learning as a practical, adaptable solution for user-centric content moderation, surpassing traditional approaches in flexibility and privacy preservation. The code and annotated dataset are publicly available for future research.

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful online content--e.g., toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment--demands robust and adaptable moderation systems. However, prevailing moderation systems are centralized and task-specific, offering limited transparency and neglecting diverse user preferences--an approach ill-suited for privacy-sensitive or decentralized environments. We propose a novel framework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models to unify the detection of toxicity, spam, and negative sentiment across binary, multi-class, and multi-label settings. Crucially, our approach enables lightweight personalization, allowing users to easily block new categories, unblock existing ones, or extend detection to semantic variations through simple prompt-based interventions--all without model retraining. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (TextDetox, UCI SMS, SST2) and a new, annotated Mastodon dataset reveal that: (i) foundation models achieve strong cross-task generalization, often matching or surpassing task-specific fine-tuned models; (ii) effective personalization is achievable with as few as one user-provided example or definition; and (iii) augmenting prompts with label definitions or rationales significantly enhances robustness to noisy, real-world data. Our work demonstrates a definitive shift beyond one-size-fits-all moderation, establishing ICL as a practical, privacy-preserving, and highly adaptable pathway for the next generation of user-centric content safety systems. To foster reproducibility and facilitate future research, we publicly release our code on GitHub and the annotated Mastodon dataset on Hugging Face.

TL;DR: FlowMM is a framework for adaptive multimodal KV cache merging, addressing biases in traditional methods and improving efficiency while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address flaws in traditional KV cache eviction strategies that degrade multimodal generation quality by causing context loss and hallucination.

Method: Introduces FlowMM, leveraging cross-modal information flow, layer-specific merging strategies, and a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism for effective KV cache merging.

Result: FlowMM significantly reduces KV cache memory (by 80%-95%) and decoding latency (by 1.3-1.8x) while maintaining competitive task performance across multimodal models.

Conclusion: FlowMM offers a more efficient and adaptive solution for KV cache merging in multimodal scenarios compared to traditional methods, enhancing memory management and performance.

Abstract: Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less critical KV-pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality, causing context loss or hallucinations. Recent efforts shift toward KV merging, merging eviction tokens with retention tokens based on similarity. However, in multimodal scenarios, distributional biases across modality tokens and attentional biases in cross-modal interactions limit its effectiveness. This work introduces FlowMM, an adaptive framework for cross-modal information flow-guided multimodal KV cache merging. FlowMM leverages cross-modal information flow to dynamically apply layer-specific merging strategies, capturing modality-specific patterns while preserving contextual integrity. Furthermore, we introduce a sensitivity-adaptive token matching mechanism that jointly evaluates token similarity and task-critical sensitivity, merging low-risk tokens while safeguarding high-sensitivity ones. Extensive experiments across diverse leading MLLMs show that FlowMM reduces KV cache memory by 80% to 95% and decoding latency by 1.3-1.8x, while maintaining competitive task performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces rhetorical mode operations and a pyramid multilayer framework for enhancing discourse design and analyzing expressive diversity and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect linguistic research, computational modeling, and rhetorical studies for enhancing usability and measurable systems.

Method: Utilizes duality-based mode operations and a pyramid multilayer mapping to quantify diversity and reduce cognitive complexity using entropy analysis.

Result: Generated new rhetorical modes, quantified expressive diversity and complexity reduction, and introduced scalable parameters for rhetorical growth speed.

Conclusion: Transforming static rhetorical systems into dynamic structures opens pathways for AI systems to leverage layered rhetorical reasoning across disciplines.

Abstract: Rhetorical modes are useful in both academic and non-academic writing, and can be subjects to be studied within linguistic research and computational modeling. Establishing a conceptual bridge among these domains could enable each to benefit from the others. This paper proposes duality-based mode operations (split-unite, forward-backward, expansion-reduction and orthogonal dualities) to expand the set of rhetorical modes, introducing generated modes like combination and generalization, thereby enhancing epistemic diversity across multiple applications. It further presents a pyramid multilayer mapping framework (e.g., three layers from the rhetorical model layer, to cognitive layer, and to epistemic layers) that reduces the resulting cognitive complexity. The degrees of expressive diversity and complexity reduction are quantified through binomial combinatorics and Shannon entropy analysis. A Marginal Rhetorical Bit (MRB) is identified, permitting the definition of a rhetorical-scalable parameter that measures expressive growth speed in bits per stage. A direct entropy measure shows that hierarchical selection over smaller subsets markedly reduces choice uncertainty compared with flat selection across all modes. These considerations appear to transform static and non-measurable rhetorical taxonomies into more dynamic and more measurable systems for discourse design. From this work, it would be possible to identify a pathway for future AI systems to operate not only on language tokens but on layered rhetorical reasoning structures, bridging linguistic, pedagogical, academic, and computational research

*Trivikram Satharasi,S Sitharama Iyengar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study assesses the risk of 'model collapse' due to recursive training on AI-generated content by analyzing semantic similarity trends in Wikipedia between 2013 and 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implications of the growing dominance of synthetic AI-generated content on the richness and diversity of human-authored datasets and its impact on AI models.

Method: Analyzed year-wise semantic similarity in English Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl data) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics to detect trends.

Result: The study observed an exponential rise in semantic similarity after public adoption of LLMs, highlighting risks of linguistic and semantic erosion from recursive AI training.

Conclusion: Data contamination from AI-generated content threatens data diversity and AI model robustness; this study provides a forecast for when this risk becomes critical.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed domains such as software engineering, journalism, creative writing, academia, and media (Naveed et al. 2025; arXiv:2307.06435). Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi & Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.

*Usha Bhalla,Alex Oesterling,Claudio Mayrink Verdun,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Flavio P. Calmon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs) to address the issues of existing dictionary learning methods for language models, specifically their failure to capture rich semantic concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dictionary learning methods for language models fail to capture meaningful semantic concepts, instead favoring shallow and noisy features. This is due to their lack of accounting for linguistic structures such as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

Method: The authors propose T-SAEs, which include a novel contrastive loss to encourage consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens, enabling disentanglement of semantic and syntactic features.

Result: T-SAEs successfully recover smoother and more coherent semantic concepts across various datasets and models, without compromising reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: T-SAEs provide a promising unsupervised approach for interpretability in language models, revealing semantic structure without explicit semantic signals.

Abstract: Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as "the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.

Motivation: To explore ways of achieving efficient language modeling under constrained resources and in low-resource environments as outlined in the BabyLM 2025 shared task.

Method: The authors employ mLSTM token mixers, short convolutions, sliding window attention, Hedgehog feature maps, and the Muon optimizer. They also develop a curated corpus focusing on readability and pedagogy.

Result: Linear attention with sliding window consistently improves zero-shot performance, while the Muon optimizer ensures better convergence stability, reducing perplexity compared to AdamW.

Conclusion: Efficient language modeling can be achieved with focused architectural and optimization methods, without reliance on scale, particularly in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We study architectural and optimization techniques for sample-efficient language modeling under the constraints of the BabyLM 2025 shared task. Our model, BLaLM, replaces self-attention with a linear-time mLSTM token mixer and explores lightweight enhancements, including short convolutions, sliding window attention with dynamic modulation, and Hedgehog feature maps. To support training in low-resource settings, we curate a high-quality corpus emphasizing readability and pedagogical structure. Experiments across both STRICT and STRICT-SMALL tracks show that (1) linear attention combined with sliding window attention consistently improves zero-shot performance, and (2) the Muon optimizer stabilizes convergence and reduces perplexity over AdamW. These results highlight effective strategies for efficient language modeling without relying on scale.

Result: Tokenizers using bytes-based vocabularies can frequently produce ill-formed UTF-8 sequences, confirming theoretical predictions through real-world examples.

Conclusion: The study identifies flaws in tokenization methods and suggests mitigations to address UTF-8 incompatibility issues in language models.

Abstract: Subword tokenization segments input text according to a pre-defined vocabulary to feed it into a language model; the language model, in turn, generates a sequence made from this same vocabulary. The members of the vocabulary can be built of code points or bytes. Using code points means that all members of the vocabulary are valid UTF-8 characters. However, it also requires thousands of initial members to achieve acceptable coverage of inputs. Beginning with bytes, on the contrary, avoids out-of-vocabulary errors with only 256 initial members of the vocabulary, but the members of the vocabulary and sequences of them are not guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. Sequences that are not valid UTF-8 break code that assumes its input to be valid UTF-8. Applications of language models must account for the breakage thereby introduced. In this paper, we formalize tokenization using monoid theory and prove that tokenizers whose vocabularies contain tokens that are ill-formed UTF-8 can always produce sequences that are ill-formed UTF-8. We demonstrate formally that attempting to incrementally convert tokens back to a string and interpret the results as UTF-8 gives different results than converting the whole sequence of tokens at once. This formal result predicts real-world bugs: we evaluate mitigations for the problem identified and provide case studies of major foundation models, serving engines, and constrained generation systems.

*Yichen Wang,Chenghao Yang,Tenghao Huang,Muhao Chen,Jonathan May,Mina Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BACo, a framework that combines base and aligned LLMs for improved diversity and quality during text generation, achieving significant performance gains compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of reduced diversity in aligned large language models while maintaining output quality.

Method: Proposes Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), a token-level framework that dynamically combines a base LLM and its aligned counterpart using routing strategies informed by prediction uncertainty and semantic role.

Result: BACo delivers a 21.3% improvement in both diversity and quality across open-ended tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods, validated by both metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Combining base and aligned LLMs through BACo effectively optimizes diversity and quality, proving superior to existing inference-time techniques and offering controllability.

Abstract: Alignment has greatly improved large language models (LLMs)' output quality at the cost of diversity, yielding highly similar outputs across generations. We propose Base-Aligned Model Collaboration (BACo), an inference-time token-level model collaboration framework that dynamically combines a base LLM with its aligned counterpart to optimize diversity and quality. Inspired by prior work (Fei et al., 2025), BACo employs routing strategies that determine, at each token, from which model to decode based on next-token prediction uncertainty and predicted contents' semantic role. Prior diversity-promoting methods, such as retraining, prompt engineering, and multi-sampling methods, improve diversity but often degrade quality or require costly decoding or post-training. In contrast, BACo achieves both high diversity and quality post hoc within a single pass, while offering strong controllability. We explore a family of routing strategies, across three open-ended generation tasks and 13 metrics covering diversity and quality, BACo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art inference-time baselines. With our best router, BACo achieves a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality. Human evaluations also mirror these improvements. The results suggest that collaboration between base and aligned models can optimize and control diversity and quality.

*Zheng Du,Hao Kang,Song Han,Tushar Krishna,Ligeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces OckBench, a new benchmark focusing on token efficiency and accuracy in language models, highlighting efficiency as a neglected but critical factor in evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the gap in existing benchmarks that focus only on accuracy and output quality while ignoring the significant impact of decoding token efficiency in real-world applications.

Method: The authors created OckBench, a hardware-agnostic and model-agnostic benchmark that evaluates language models on both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Comparative experiments were performed using multiple models.

Result: Results revealed significant differences in token efficiency among models with comparable accuracy. Efficiency variations were highlighted as a critical yet overlooked axis of model evaluation.

Conclusion: The study calls for a paradigm shift in model evaluation to prioritize token efficiency alongside accuracy, emphasizing the importance of treating decoding tokens as a constrained resource. OckBench serves as a standardized platform for this purpose, and is openly available to drive further research.

Abstract: Large language models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and the Gemini series have improved automated reasoning and code generation. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on accuracy and output quality, and they ignore an important factor: decoding token efficiency. In real systems, generating 10,000 tokens versus 100,000 tokens leads to large differences in latency, cost, and energy. In this work, we introduce OckBench, a model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic benchmark that evaluates both accuracy and token count for reasoning and coding tasks. Through experiments comparing multiple open- and closed-source models, we uncover that many models with comparable accuracy differ wildly in token consumption, revealing that efficiency variance is a neglected but significant axis of differentiation. We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the accuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should no longer treat tokens as "free" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified platform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient reasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ .

*Kerem Sahin,Sheridan Feucht,Adam Belfki,Jannik Brinkmann,Aaron Mueller,David Bau,Chris Wendler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores whether transformers can attain in-context learning (ICL) capabilities when inductive copying by attention heads is suppressed, finding that such capabilities remain intact while reducing dependence on induction heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research investigates the necessity of inductive copying by induction heads for enabling complex in-context learning and explores alternative training settings.

Method: The paper introduces Hapax, a training approach that omits loss contributions from tokens predictable by induction heads, thereby reducing inductive copying but preserving learning processes.

Result: Using Hapax, models perform comparably or better than standard models on 13 of 21 abstractive ICL tasks, even with 31.7% of tokens omitted from the loss. Mechanistic analysis shows reduced dependence on induction heads without compromising ICL capabilities.

Conclusion: Inductive copying by induction heads is not essential for learning abstractive in-context learning mechanisms, as alternative approaches like Hapax maintain or improve ICL performance.

Abstract: Induction heads are attention heads that perform inductive copying by matching patterns from earlier context and copying their continuations verbatim. As models develop induction heads, they often experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may serve as a prerequisite for more complex in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we ask whether transformers can still acquire ICL capabilities when inductive copying is suppressed. We propose Hapax, a setting where we omit the loss contribution of any token that can be correctly predicted by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, performance on abstractive ICL tasks (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context) remains comparable and surpasses the vanilla model on 13 of 21 tasks, even though 31.7\% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that cannot be predicted correctly by induction heads. Mechanistic analysis further shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads but still preserve ICL capabilities. Taken together, our findings indicate that inductive copying is not essential for learning abstractive ICL mechanisms.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid text classification method combining large language models, feature pyramids, and graph neural networks for improved semantic understanding and classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively modeling complex semantic contexts in text classification by combining deep semantic representations, multi-scale fusion, and structured modeling.

Method: The method integrates deep feature extraction using large language models, multi-scale feature fusion via pyramids, and structured modeling with graph neural networks to capture latent semantics and logical dependencies.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in key metrics (ACC, F1-Score, AUC, Precision) compared to existing models, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel framework balancing global and local information alongside structured semantic modeling, offering a new perspective on text classification challenges.

Abstract: This study investigates a hybrid method for text classification that integrates deep feature extraction from large language models, multi-scale fusion through feature pyramids, and structured modeling with graph neural networks to enhance performance in complex semantic contexts. First, the large language model captures contextual dependencies and deep semantic representations of the input text, providing a rich feature foundation for subsequent modeling. Then, based on multi-level feature representations, the feature pyramid mechanism effectively integrates semantic features of different scales, balancing global information and local details to construct hierarchical semantic expressions. Furthermore, the fused features are transformed into graph representations, and graph neural networks are employed to capture latent semantic relations and logical dependencies in the text, enabling comprehensive modeling of complex interactions among semantic units. On this basis, the readout and classification modules generate the final category predictions. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in robustness alignment experiments, outperforming existing models on ACC, F1-Score, AUC, and Precision, which verifies the effectiveness and stability of the framework. This study not only constructs an integrated framework that balances global and local information as well as semantics and structure, but also provides a new perspective for multi-scale feature fusion and structured semantic modeling in text classification tasks.

TL;DR: Theoretical language generation is always possible, but practical feasibility is restricted due to large or non-computable requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical viability of successfully generating sentences using theoretical guarantees.

Method: Analyzing language families such as regular and context-free languages to determine the examples required for successful generation.

Result: The study shows that the number of required examples can be too large or unbounded, indicating a gap between theoretical and efficient learnability.

Conclusion: Efficient language generation in practice needs to account for structural properties of natural language, despite theoretical possibilities.

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan showed that, in principle, language generation is always possible: with sufficiently many positive examples, a learner can eventually produce sentences indistinguishable from those of a target language. However, the existence of such a guarantee does not speak to its practical feasibility. In this work, we show that even for simple and well-studied language families -- such as regular and context-free languages -- the number of examples required for successful generation can be extraordinarily large, and in some cases not bounded by any computable function. These results reveal a substantial gap between theoretical possibility and efficient learnability. They suggest that explaining the empirical success of modern language models requires a refined perspective -- one that takes into account structural properties of natural language that make effective generation possible in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRAGON, a reasoning-based framework, improves unlearning in language models without accessing retain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and remove harmful knowledge from LLMs in practical scenarios without relying on access to retain data.

Method: DRAGON uses a detection module and in-context chain-of-thought instructions to identify and intervene on forget-worthy prompts before an LLM's inference.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that DRAGON effectively facilitates unlearning in language models while ensuring scalability and practical applicability.

Conclusion: DRAGON offers a novel and practical approach to unlearning in LLMs, showcasing strong capabilities without retain data dependency.

Abstract: Unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for protecting private data and removing harmful knowledge. Most existing approaches rely on fine-tuning to balance unlearning efficiency with general language capabilities. However, these methods typically require training or access to retain data, which is often unavailable in real world scenarios. Although these methods can perform well when both forget and retain data are available, few works have demonstrated equivalent capability in more practical, data-limited scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Detect-Reasoning Augmented GeneratiON (DRAGON), a systematic, reasoning-based framework that utilizes in-context chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions to guard deployed LLMs before inference. Instead of modifying the base model, DRAGON leverages the inherent instruction-following ability of LLMs and introduces a lightweight detection module to identify forget-worthy prompts without any retain data. These are then routed through a dedicated CoT guard model to enforce safe and accurate in-context intervention. To robustly evaluate unlearning performance, we introduce novel metrics for unlearning performance and the continual unlearning setting. Extensive experiments across three representative unlearning tasks validate the effectiveness of DRAGON, demonstrating its strong unlearning capability, scalability, and applicability in practical scenarios.

*Yinjie Cheng,Paul Youssef,Christin Seifert,Jörg Schlötterer,Zhixue Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how fine-tuning affects the persistence of knowledge edits in large language models, evaluating methods and proposing strategies to manage decay in edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the critical question of whether edits made to LLMs survive after fine-tuning, which has implications for cost, utility, and safety of LLMs.

Method: Systematic analysis involving two editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches across five models and three datasets (232 configurations), along with proposing selective-layer fine-tuning.

Result: Edits decay after fine-tuning, with varying survival rates across methods and configurations. Selective-layer fine-tuning can effectively remove edits but slightly impacts performance.

Conclusion: Evaluating knowledge edits in LLMs must consider the broader application pipeline; actionable strategies are introduced for integrating editing with fine-tuning, with safety and cost implications emphasized.

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as a lightweight alternative to retraining for correcting or injecting specific facts in large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance. Surprisingly, fine-tuning non-edited layers impairs more edits than full fine-tuning. Overall, our study establishes empirical baselines and actionable strategies for integrating knowledge editing with fine-tuning, and underscores that evaluating model editing requires considering the full LLM application pipeline.

TL;DR: The study analyzes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies in medicine, finding them still in early stages but showing potential for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by the rapid growth of medical knowledge and the complexity of clinical practice by exploring the role of RAG technologies.

Method: The study reviewed RAG applications in medicine, focusing on data sources, retrieval approaches, LLMs used, and evaluation techniques.

Result: Findings reveal reliance on publicly available data, limited use of medical-specific LLMs, English-centric embedding models for retrieval, and automated and human evaluation metrics. Main use cases include question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction.

Conclusion: Medical RAG is at an early stage and needs further advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for under-resourced settings for trustworthy global adoption.

Abstract: The rapid growth of medical knowledge and increasing complexity of clinical practice pose challenges. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated value; however, inherent limitations remain. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies show potential to enhance their clinical applicability. This study reviewed RAG applications in medicine. We found that research primarily relied on publicly available data, with limited application in private data. For retrieval, approaches commonly relied on English-centric embedding models, while LLMs were mostly generic, with limited use of medical-specific LLMs. For evaluation, automated metrics evaluated generation quality and task performance, whereas human evaluation focused on accuracy, completeness, relevance, and fluency, with insufficient attention to bias and safety. RAG applications were concentrated on question answering, report generation, text summarization, and information extraction. Overall, medical RAG remains at an early stage, requiring advances in clinical validation, cross-linguistic adaptation, and support for low-resource settings to enable trustworthy and responsible global use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NILC leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance clustering in New Intent Discovery (NID), significantly outperforming existing baselines on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve recognition of new and known intents in dialogue systems by addressing limitations in existing cascaded architectures used for New Intent Discovery.

Method: NILC uses an iterative clustering framework enriched with semantic centroids and cluster refinement via large language models (LLMs). It includes techniques like rewriting hard samples, injecting supervision signals, and updating centroids and embeddings iteratively.

Result: NILC demonstrated consistent and significant performance improvements across six benchmark datasets in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: The paper presents NILC as a novel framework optimized for NID, showcasing its potential for enhancing clustering performance using advanced methods like LLMs and new supervision techniques.

Abstract: New intent discovery (NID) seeks to recognize both new and known intents from unlabeled user utterances, which finds prevalent use in practical dialogue systems. Existing works towards NID mainly adopt a cascaded architecture, wherein the first stage focuses on encoding the utterances into informative text embeddings beforehand, while the latter is to group similar embeddings into clusters (i.e., intents), typically by K-Means. However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing NILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance improvements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently.

*Ankan Mullick,Sukannya Purkayastha,Saransh Sharma,Pawan Goyal,Niloy Ganguly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces IDALC, a semi-supervised framework aimed at improving intent detection and correcting rejection errors in voice-controlled systems, while significantly reducing annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice-controlled systems often reject queries due to low confidence or untrained intents, requiring costly and time-consuming manual annotation and retraining. The study aims to address these efficiency issues.

Method: The paper presents IDALC, a semi-supervised framework that combines intent detection with active learning to handle system-rejected utterances and reduce annotation effort.

Result: Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that IDALC improves accuracy by 5-10% and macro-F1 by 4-8% compared to baseline methods while keeping annotation cost at only 6-10% of available unlabelled data.

Conclusion: IDALC effectively enhances performance in intent detection for voice-controlled systems with limited human involvement, providing a cost-effective solution for system retraining and query correction.

Abstract: Voice-controlled dialog systems have become immensely popular due to their ability to perform a wide range of actions in response to diverse user queries. These agents possess a predefined set of skills or intents to fulfill specific user tasks. But every system has its own limitations. There are instances where, even for known intents, if any model exhibits low confidence, it results in rejection of utterances that necessitate manual annotation. Additionally, as time progresses, there may be a need to retrain these agents with new intents from the system-rejected queries to carry out additional tasks. Labeling all these emerging intents and rejected utterances over time is impractical, thus calling for an efficient mechanism to reduce annotation costs. In this paper, we introduce IDALC (Intent Detection and Active Learning based Correction), a semi-supervised framework designed to detect user intents and rectify system-rejected utterances while minimizing the need for human annotation. Empirical findings on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our system surpasses baseline methods, achieving a 5-10% higher accuracy and a 4-8% improvement in macro-F1. Remarkably, we maintain the overall annotation cost at just 6-10% of the unlabelled data available to the system. The overall framework of IDALC is shown in Fig. 1

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances language models' knowledge recall and navigation of hierarchical knowledge, outperforming fine-tuned models in specific tasks like medical codes. Structured prompting explains significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the notion that reinforcement learning harms memorized knowledge in language models and explore its impact on procedural skills for hierarchical knowledge traversal.

Method: Implemented and evaluated RL-enhanced models and examined their performance in knowledge recall tasks. Structured prompting was introduced to compare and analyze performances between supervised fine-tuning and RL-enhanced models, supported by internal activation comparisons.

Result: RL-trained models outperform supervised fine-tuning in recalling hierarchical knowledge and procedural retrieval paths. Structured prompting reduces performance disparity, but RL models retain an edge in procedural accuracy. Internal analysis revealed RL's impact on query traversal rather than knowledge representation.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning transforms how language models traverse and access knowledge hierarchies, enhancing procedural retrieval capabilities without altering factual knowledge representations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is often credited with improving language model reasoning and generalization at the expense of degrading memorized knowledge. We challenge this narrative by observing that RL-enhanced models consistently outperform their base and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts on pure knowledge recall tasks, particularly those requiring traversal of hierarchical, structured knowledge (e.g., medical codes). We hypothesize these gains stem not from newly acquired data, but from improved procedural skills in navigating and searching existing knowledge hierarchies within the model parameters. To support this hypothesis, we show that structured prompting, which explicitly guides SFTed models through hierarchical traversal, recovers most of the performance gap (reducing 24pp to 7pp on MedConceptsQA for DeepSeek-V3/R1). We further find that while prompting improves final-answer accuracy, RL-enhanced models retain superior ability to recall correct procedural paths on deep-retrieval tasks. Finally our layer-wise internal activation analysis reveals that while factual representations (e.g., activations for the statement "code 57.95 refers to urinary infection") maintain high cosine similarity between SFT and RL models, query representations (e.g., "what is code 57.95") diverge noticeably, indicating that RL primarily transforms how models traverse knowledge rather than the knowledge representation itself.

TL;DR: This paper investigates entropy dynamics in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for enhancing large language models (LLMs), revealing critical factors influencing entropy and proposing ways to effectively regulate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy collapse often occurs during RLVR training of LLMs, leading to suboptimal performance. The study aims to comprehensively understand entropy behavior and its effects on model outcomes.

Method: Extensive experiments are conducted to explore how entropy dynamics correlate with factors such as response diversity, calibration, and performance. Theoretical and empirical analysis is carried out to identify key contributors to entropy collapse.

Result: Key findings include the identification of off-policy updates, training data diversity, and clipping thresholds as critical factors. Tokens with positive advantages most contribute to entropy collapse, and adjusting loss weights for different tokens effectively regulates model entropy.

Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into entropy regulation and its impact on LLM performance, offering practical strategies for improving RLVR training outcomes and mitigating entropy collapse.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a predominant approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the entropy of LLMs usually collapses during RLVR training, causing premature convergence to suboptimal local minima and hinder further performance improvement. Although various approaches have been proposed to mitigate entropy collapse, a comprehensive study of entropy in RLVR remains lacking. To address this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the entropy dynamics of LLMs trained with RLVR and analyze how model entropy correlates with response diversity, calibration, and performance across various benchmarks. Our findings reveal that the number of off-policy updates, the diversity of training data, and the clipping thresholds in the optimization objective are critical factors influencing the entropy of LLMs trained with RLVR. Moreover, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that tokens with positive advantages are the primary contributors to entropy collapse, and that model entropy can be effectively regulated by adjusting the relative loss weights of tokens with positive and negative advantages during training.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates language models (LLMs) on their ability to accurately retain age-related information in summarizing biomedical studies. It identifies systematic disparities across models and demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address concerns about whether language models preserve critical demographic distinctions, like age groups, during biomedical evidence synthesis, as improper retention may lead to biased or ineffective clinical interventions.

Method: The researchers constructed DemogSummary, an age-stratified dataset, and evaluated three LLMs (Qwen, Longformer, GPT-4.1 Nano) using standard metrics and the newly introduced Demographic Salience Score (DSS).

Result: The analysis revealed disparities in summarization quality, with adult-focused summaries demonstrating the least demographic fidelity and under-represented groups having higher rates of hallucinations.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show limitations in faithfully retaining demographic information, leading to potential biases. The study calls for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and improved summarization practices in biomedical NLP.

Abstract: Clinical interventions often hinge on age: medications and procedures safe for adults may be harmful to children or ineffective for older adults. However, as language models are increasingly integrated into biomedical evidence synthesis workflows, it remains uncertain whether these systems preserve such crucial demographic distinctions. To address this gap, we evaluate how well state-of-the-art language models retain age-related information when generating abstractive summaries of biomedical studies. We construct DemogSummary, a novel age-stratified dataset of systematic review primary studies, covering child, adult, and older adult populations. We evaluate three prominent summarisation-capable LLMs, Qwen (open-source), Longformer (open-source) and GPT-4.1 Nano (proprietary), using both standard metrics and a newly proposed Demographic Salience Score (DSS), which quantifies age-related entity retention and hallucination. Our results reveal systematic disparities across models and age groups: demographic fidelity is lowest for adult-focused summaries, and under-represented populations are more prone to hallucinations. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in faithful and bias-free summarisation and point to the need for fairness-aware evaluation frameworks and summarisation pipelines in biomedical NLP.

### [103] [Multi-Reward GRPO Fine-Tuning for De-biasing Large Language Models: A Study Based on Chinese-Context Discrimination Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06023)
*Deng Yixuan,Ji Xiaoqiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to reduce biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) and promote ethical behavior, specifically addressing cultural-contextual discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit embedded biases and discriminatory tendencies that align with societal stereotypes, which are incompletely addressed by existing alignment methods like RLHF and DPO. The motivation lies in addressing culturally specific, multi-dimensional discrimination.

Method: The authors propose GRPO, which uses a synthetic dataset based on Chinese-context discrimination categories. A reward model, trained using DeBERTa-v3, provides multi-dimensional signals (fairness, neutrality, linguistic quality) to guide fine-tuning of LLMs for ethical improvements.

Result: Experimental results show reduced bias intensity in LLM outputs and improved alignment with ethical non-discrimination standards, all while maintaining linguistic quality.

Conclusion: The GRPO framework demonstrates effectiveness in minimizing biases in LLMs and provides a reusable approach for aligning LLMs with cultural-contextual ethical principles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit implicit biases and discriminatory tendencies that reflect underlying social stereotypes. While recent alignment techniques such as RLHF and DPO have mitigated some of these issues, they remain limited in addressing culturally specific and multi-dimensional forms of discrimination. This paper proposes a Multi-Reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework to fine-tune LLMs toward ethical and bias-free behavior. Our approach constructs a synthetic English-language dataset derived from Chinese-context discrimination categories, including regional, ethnic, and occupational biases. Each instance is paired with both neutral and biased responses to train a reward model based on DeBERTa-v3, which provides multi-dimensional reward signals capturing fairness, neutrality, and linguistic quality. The trained reward model then guides GRPO fine-tuning to optimize model outputs along these ethical dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in bias intensity and improved alignment with non-discriminatory standards without compromising fluency or informativeness. This study highlights the effectiveness of GRPO-based multi-reward optimization for de-biasing LLMs and offers a replicable framework for cultural-contextual ethical alignment.

*Xinyuan Yan,Shusen Liu,Kowshik Thopalli,Bei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops an interactive visualization system to analyze sparse autoencoder features in large language models, addressing limitations of conventional methods like UMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse autoencoders uncover interpretable features in large language models, but the sheer number of features hinders meaningful analysis and exploration using existing visualization methods.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid system combining topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction to curate and focus on selected SAE features, avoiding overplotting and distortions.

Result: The visualization system facilitates exploration of both local and global relationships in sparse autoencoder features, enabling targeted investigation of latent space representations.

Conclusion: This framework improves interpretability and analysis of sparse autoencoder behavior and curated concepts in large language models, overcoming limitations of conventional visualization techniques like UMAP.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for uncovering interpretable features in large language models (LLMs) through the sparse directions they learn. However, the sheer number of extracted directions makes comprehensive exploration intractable. While conventional embedding techniques such as UMAP can reveal global structure, they suffer from limitations including high-dimensional compression artifacts, overplotting, and misleading neighborhood distortions. In this work, we propose a focused exploration framework that prioritizes curated concepts and their corresponding SAE features over attempts to visualize all available features simultaneously. We present an interactive visualization system that combines topology-based visual encoding with dimensionality reduction to faithfully represent both local and global relationships among selected features. This hybrid approach enables users to investigate SAE behavior through targeted, interpretable subsets, facilitating deeper and more nuanced analysis of concept representation in latent space.

Result: Achieves a macro F1 score of 0.85, which is 94% of state-of-the-art models, using a significantly smaller model (134M vs 14B parameters). Requires only 1.87M trainable parameters and trains in 2 hours on a single T4 GPU.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained, real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of developing computationally efficient hate speech detection systems that maintain competitive performance while being practical for real-time deployment. We propose a novel three-layer framework that combines rule-based pre-filtering with a parameter-efficient LoRA-tuned BERTweet model and continuous learning capabilities. Our approach achieves 0.85 macro F1 score - representing 94% of the performance of state-of-the-art large language models like SafePhi (Phi-4 based) while using a base model that is 100x smaller (134M vs 14B parameters). Compared to traditional BERT-based approaches with similar computational requirements, our method demonstrates superior performance through strategic dataset unification and optimized fine-tuning. The system requires only 1.87M trainable parameters (1.37% of full fine-tuning) and trains in approximately 2 hours on a single T4 GPU, making robust hate speech detection accessible in resource-constrained environments while maintaining competitive accuracy for real-world deployment.

### [106] [ReMoD: Rethinking Modality Contribution in Multimodal Stance Detection via Dual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06057)
*Bingbing Wang,Zhengda Jin,Bin Liang,Jing Li,Ruifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ReMoD, a framework for Multimodal Stance Detection (MSD) that dynamically assesses modality contributions using a dual-reasoning approach, improving performance and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for MSD fail to properly handle varying contributions of different modalities, which can introduce stance misunderstanding noise and errors due to oversimplified fusion of modalities.

Method: ReMoD employs a dual-reasoning paradigm inspired by human cognition—using experience-driven intuitive reasoning for initial stance hypotheses and deliberate reflective reasoning to refine modality contributions and semantics. This involves querying and updating Modality and Semantic Experience Pools to ensure dynamic and context-aware stance learning.

Result: ReMoD demonstrates substantial improvements over baseline models in the public MMSD benchmark and shows strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-reasoning approach of ReMoD effectively addresses the limitations of existing multimodal stance detection methods, enabling dynamic, accurate, and context-aware stance judgments.

Abstract: Multimodal Stance Detection (MSD) is a crucial task for understanding public opinion on social media. Existing work simply fuses information from various modalities to learn stance representations, overlooking the varying contributions of stance expression from different modalities. Therefore, stance misunderstanding noises may be drawn into the stance learning process due to the risk of learning errors by rough modality combination. To address this, we get inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition and propose **ReMoD**, a framework that **Re**thinks **Mo**dality contribution of stance expression through a **D**ual-reasoning paradigm. ReMoD integrates *experience-driven intuitive reasoning* to capture initial stance cues with *deliberate reflective reasoning* to adjust for modality biases, refine stance judgments, and thereby dynamically weight modality contributions based on their actual expressive power for the target stance. Specifically, the intuitive stage queries the Modality Experience Pool (MEP) and Semantic Experience Pool (SEP) to form an initial stance hypothesis, prioritizing historically impactful modalities. This hypothesis is then refined in the reflective stage via two reasoning chains: Modality-CoT updates MEP with adaptive fusion strategies to amplify relevant modalities, while Semantic-CoT refines SEP with deeper contextual insights of stance semantics. These dual experience structures are continuously refined during training and recalled at inference to guide robust and context-aware stance decisions. Extensive experiments on the public MMSD benchmark demonstrate that our ReMoD significantly outperforms most baseline models and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

*Haoyue Yang,Xuanle Zhao,Yujie Liu,Zhuojun Zou,Kailin Lyu,Changchun Zhou,Yao Zhu,Jie Hao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArchCraft offers an innovative framework for translating abstract architectural descriptions from papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with RTL verification. It also introduces the first benchmarking suite, ArchSynthBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducing hardware architectures from academic research is difficult due to limited publicly available source code and the complexity of HDLs.

Method: ArchCraft uses formal graphs to define architectural blueprints and symbols for functional specifications, producing synthesizable RTL, testbench code, and PPA metrics. It also introduces a dedicated benchmarking suite, ArchSynthBench, for evaluating hardware synthesis methods.

Result: ArchCraft surpasses existing methods in understanding and generating hardware code, as evaluated on the ArchSynthBench benchmark. Generated RTL implementations meet timing constraints with performance consistent with original paper reports.

Conclusion: ArchCraft simplifies hardware reproduction from academic descriptions and ensures accurate, verifiable hardware implementations.

Abstract: The reproduction of hardware architectures from academic papers remains a significant challenge due to the lack of publicly available source code and the complexity of hardware description languages (HDLs). To this end, we propose \textbf{ArchCraft}, a Framework that converts abstract architectural descriptions from academic papers into synthesizable Verilog projects with register-transfer level (RTL) verification. ArchCraft introduces a structured workflow, which uses formal graphs to capture the Architectural Blueprint and symbols to define the Functional Specification, translating unstructured academic papers into verifiable, hardware-aware designs. The framework then generates RTL and testbench (TB) code decoupled via these symbols to facilitate verification and debugging, ultimately reporting the circuit's Power, Area, and Performance (PPA). Moreover, we propose the first benchmark, \textbf{ArchSynthBench}, for synthesizing hardware from architectural descriptions, with a complete set of evaluation indicators, 50 project-level circuits, and around 600 circuit blocks. We systematically assess ArchCraft on ArchSynthBench, where the experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, surpassing direct generation methods and the VerilogCoder framework in both paper understanding and code completion. Furthermore, evaluation and physical implementation of the generated executable RTL code show that these implementations meet all timing constraints without violations, and their performance metrics are consistent with those reported in the original papers.

### [108] [Stemming Hallucination in Language Models Using a Licensing Oracle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06073)
*Simeon Emanuilov,Richard Ackermann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Licensing Oracle to tackle hallucinations in language models by validating outputs against structured knowledge graphs, achieving impressive results with perfect precision and zero false answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent hallucination problems in language models and ensure factually accurate natural language generation.

Method: Developed the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution enforcing truth constraints via validation against structured knowledge graphs, integrating deterministic verification within generation processes.

Result: Experiments showed that while methods like RAG and fine-tuning reduced hallucinations, they did not fully resolve them. The Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision and zero false answers, with a high factual accuracy of 89.1%.

Conclusion: The Licensing Oracle demonstrates that deterministic architectural solutions can effectively eliminate hallucinations in fact-based domains, paving the way for truth-constrained AI systems.

Abstract: Language models exhibit remarkable natural language generation capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, generating factually incorrect information despite producing syntactically coherent responses. This study introduces the Licensing Oracle, an architectural solution designed to stem hallucinations in LMs by enforcing truth constraints through formal validation against structured knowledge graphs. Unlike statistical approaches that rely on data scaling or fine-tuning, the Licensing Oracle embeds a deterministic validation step into the model's generative process, ensuring that only factually accurate claims are made. We evaluated the effectiveness of the Licensing Oracle through experiments comparing it with several state-of-the-art methods, including baseline language model generation, fine-tuning for factual recall, fine-tuning for abstention behavior, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our results demonstrate that although RAG and fine-tuning improve performance, they fail to eliminate hallucinations. In contrast, the Licensing Oracle achieved perfect abstention precision (AP = 1.0) and zero false answers (FAR-NE = 0.0), ensuring that only valid claims were generated with 89.1% accuracy in factual responses. This work shows that architectural innovations, such as the Licensing Oracle, offer a necessary and sufficient solution for hallucinations in domains with structured knowledge representations, offering guarantees that statistical methods cannot match. Although the Licensing Oracle is specifically designed to address hallucinations in fact-based domains, its framework lays the groundwork for truth-constrained generation in future AI systems, providing a new path toward reliable, epistemically grounded models.

*Nathan Scales,Nathanael Schärli,Olivier Bousquet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in handling complex questions involving distributed or reasoning-heavy information and demonstrates improvements over long-context methods by optimizing RAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor performance of current RAG methods on complex questions requiring reasoning over distributed data, as highlighted by the QUEST-LOFT benchmark.

Method: The study conducts detailed analysis, updates performance metrics via human evaluation, and improves RAG methods by introducing structured reasoning and evidence-based output formats.

Result: Optimized RAG methods significantly outperform long-context-based approaches in handling reasoning and evidence-intensive scenarios.

Conclusion: RAG systems, when appropriately optimized, can overcome their limitations and become effective tools for grounded QA involving complex reasoning and distributed knowledge.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a solution for grounded QA in both academia and industry, current RAG methods struggle with questions where the necessary information is distributed across many documents or where retrieval needs to be combined with complex reasoning. Recently, the LOFT study has shown that this limitation also applies to approaches based on long-context language models, with the QUEST benchmark exhibiting particularly large headroom. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to the poor performance on QUEST-LOFT, publish updated numbers based on a thorough human evaluation, and demonstrate that RAG can be optimized to significantly outperform long-context approaches when combined with a structured output format containing reasoning and evidence, optionally followed by answer re-verification.

### [111] [Referring Expressions as a Lens into Spatial Language Grounding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06146)
*Akshar Tumu,Varad Shinde,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores spatial reasoning challenges in vision-language models by using Referring Expression Comprehension tasks instead of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the existing difficulty VLMs encounter in spatial reasoning and propose a more suitable evaluation method focusing on specific situations.

Method: Analyzing spatial reasoning through the Referring Expression Comprehension task, evaluating different architectures and spatial semantic categories.

Result: Models show variability in handling spatial semantics, with challenges influenced by ambiguity, complexity, and specific syntactic structures.

Conclusion: The study identifies strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in spatial comprehension by VLMs, offering direction for future research.

Abstract: Spatial Reasoning is an important component of human cognition and is an area in which the latest Vision-language models (VLMs) show signs of difficulty. The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.

*Ryuhei Miyazato,Ting-Ruen Wei,Xuyang Wu,Hsin-Tai Wu,Kei Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A QA-based evaluation framework for summarizing books focusing on specific aspects was introduced, leveraging narrative knowledge graphs for assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently limited exploration of aspect-based summarization for books due to challenges in creating reference summaries for long texts.

Method: The paper introduces BookAsSumQA, a QA-based framework using narrative knowledge graphs to evaluate summaries through question-answering performance.

Result: The experiments show LLM-based methods excel for shorter texts, while RAG-based techniques perform better for longer documents.

Conclusion: BookAsSumQA is practical and efficient for evaluating aspect-based summarizations, particularly for longer texts.

Abstract: Aspect-based summarization aims to generate summaries that highlight specific aspects of a text, enabling more personalized and targeted summaries. However, its application to books remains unexplored due to the difficulty of constructing reference summaries for long text. To address this challenge, we propose BookAsSumQA, a QA-based evaluation framework for aspect-based book summarization. BookAsSumQA automatically generates aspect-specific QA pairs from a narrative knowledge graph to evaluate summary quality based on its question-answering performance. Our experiments using BookAsSumQA revealed that while LLM-based approaches showed higher accuracy on shorter texts, RAG-based methods become more effective as document length increases, making them more efficient and practical for aspect-based book summarization.

### [113] [Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06190)
*Sangmook Lee,Dohyung Kim,Hyukhun Koh,Nakyeong Yang,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called STEER which reduces inference costs in large language models by routing tasks between smaller and larger models based on confidence scores, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of high inference costs in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining their reasoning capabilities, and to overcome the limitations of prior methods like robustness under domain shifts and expensive data synthesis techniques.

Method: STEER, a domain-agnostic framework, uses confidence scores from the smaller model's logits to decide step-level routing between smaller and larger models, avoiding reliance on external models for routing.

Result: STEER improves reasoning performance with reduced inference costs, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy and 48% lower computational costs in benchmarks like AIME, outperforming methods that depend on external routing modules.

Conclusion: Model-internal confidence scores are effective, robust, and domain-agnostic signals for efficient model routing, offering a scalable and cost-efficient strategy for deploying large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) - particularly model scaling and test-time techniques - have greatly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of language models at the expense of higher inference costs. To lower inference costs, prior works train router models or deferral mechanisms that allocate easy queries to a small, efficient model, while forwarding harder queries to larger, more expensive models. However, these trained router models often lack robustness under domain shifts and require expensive data synthesis techniques such as Monte Carlo rollouts to obtain sufficient ground-truth routing labels for training. In this work, we propose Confidence-Guided Stepwise Model Routing for Cost-Efficient Reasoning (STEER), a domain-agnostic framework that performs fine-grained, step-level routing between smaller and larger LLMs without utilizing external models. STEER leverages confidence scores from the smaller model's logits prior to generating a reasoning step, so that the large model is invoked only when necessary. Extensive evaluations using different LLMs on a diverse set of challenging benchmarks across multiple domains such as Mathematical Reasoning, Multi-Hop QA, and Planning tasks indicate that STEER achieves competitive or enhanced accuracy while reducing inference costs (up to +20% accuracy with 48% less FLOPs compared to solely using the larger model on AIME), outperforming baselines that rely on trained external modules. Our results establish model-internal confidence as a robust, domain-agnostic signal for model routing, offering a scalable pathway for efficient LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes EK-ICL, a framework using structured explicit knowledge to address challenges in detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through language models, outperforming baselines and excelling in low-resource conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting AD using narrative transcripts with language models is difficult, especially under limited data and out-of-distribution scenarios, due to challenges in task recognition, demo selection, and label alignment.

Method: EK-ICL integrates structured explicit knowledge including confidence scores, parsing feature scores, and label replacement, along with parsing-based retrieval and ensemble prediction.

Result: EK-ICL showed superior performance across three AD datasets compared to fine-tuning and ICL baselines.

Conclusion: Explicit knowledge integration enhances reasoning stability and label-task alignment, proving crucial in low-resource clinical applications like AD detection.

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from narrative transcripts remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), particularly under out-of-distribution (OOD) and data-scarce conditions. While in-context learning (ICL) provides a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, existing ICL approaches often suffer from task recognition failure, suboptimal demonstration selection, and misalignment between label words and task objectives, issues that are amplified in clinical domains like AD detection. We propose Explicit Knowledge In-Context Learners (EK-ICL), a novel framework that integrates structured explicit knowledge to enhance reasoning stability and task alignment in ICL. EK-ICL incorporates three knowledge components: confidence scores derived from small language models (SLMs) to ground predictions in task-relevant patterns, parsing feature scores to capture structural differences and improve demo selection, and label word replacement to resolve semantic misalignment with LLM priors. In addition, EK-ICL employs a parsing-based retrieval strategy and ensemble prediction to mitigate the effects of semantic homogeneity in AD transcripts. Extensive experiments across three AD datasets demonstrate that EK-ICL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning and ICL baselines. Further analysis reveals that ICL performance in AD detection is highly sensitive to the alignment of label semantics and task-specific context, underscoring the importance of explicit knowledge in clinical reasoning under low-resource conditions.

*Yue Huang,Xiangqi Wang,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces priority alignment, emphasizing 'trustworthy-before-helpful' optimization for LLMs, with Self-Priority Alignment (SPA) being the proposed framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the conflict between trustworthiness and helpfulness in LLMs, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes SPA, using unsupervised response generation, self-evaluation, refinement, and dual-criterion denoising. SPA constructs preference pairs and fine-tunes models with uncertainty-weighted alignment loss.

Result: Experiments show SPA enhances helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines and maintaining general model capabilities.

Conclusion: SPA provides a scalable and transparent alignment method for critical LLM applications, preserving both safety and utility.

Abstract: In high-stakes scenarios-such as self-harm, legal, or medical queries-LLMs must be both trustworthy and helpful. However, these goals often conflict. We propose priority alignment, a new alignment paradigm that enforces a strict "trustworthy-before-helpful" ordering: optimization of helpfulness is conditioned on first meeting trustworthy thresholds (e.g., harmlessness or honesty). To realize this, we introduce Self-Priority Alignment (SPA)-a fully unsupervised framework that generates diverse responses, self-evaluates them and refines them by the model itself, and applies dual-criterion denoising to remove inconsistency and control variance. From this, SPA constructs lexicographically ordered preference pairs and fine-tunes the model using an uncertainty-weighted alignment loss that emphasizes high-confidence, high-gap decisions. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SPA improves helpfulness without compromising safety, outperforming strong baselines while preserving general capabilities. Our results demonstrate that SPA provides a scalable and interpretable alignment strategy for critical LLM applications.

Result: The top team achieved a Jaccard score of 0.5102 and F1 score of 0.6267, showcasing promising results by leveraging LLM-based systems.

Conclusion: LLM-based systems demonstrate potential but still face challenges in medication recommendation tasks using Chinese EHRs. Further research remains necessary.

Abstract: Discharge medication recommendation plays a critical role in ensuring treatment continuity, preventing readmission, and improving long-term management for patients with chronic metabolic diseases. This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs.

TL;DR: The study examines an ELECTRA-small model's performance on negation within the SNLI dataset and enhances its accuracy through targeted data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained NLI models often misuse dataset artifacts, particularly struggling with negation understanding.

Method: Analyzed the model's performance on negation examples, then used contrast sets and adversarial examples for data augmentation.

Result: Improved the model's accuracy on negation examples without compromising overall performance.

Conclusion: Targeted data augmentation is effective in overcoming NLI model limitations associated with negation.

Abstract: Pre-trained models for natural language inference (NLI) often achieve high performance on benchmark datasets by using spurious correlations, or dataset artifacts, rather than understanding language touches such as negation. In this project, we investigate the performance of an ELECTRA-small model fine-tuned on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, focusing on its handling of negation. Through analysis, we identify that the model struggles with correctly classifying examples containing negation. To address this, we augment the training data with contrast sets and adversarial examples emphasizing negation. Our results demonstrate that this targeted data augmentation improves the model's accuracy on negation-containing examples without adversely affecting overall performance, therefore mitigating the identified dataset artifact.

TL;DR: The study introduces EvalTS benchmark and TimeSense framework to improve LLMs' reasoning on time-series data by addressing bias toward text signals and enhancing temporal-spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the limitation of existing LLM-based methods for time-series tasks, which may over-rely on text labels and neglect temporal features, potentially leading to contradictory outputs.

Method: EvalTS benchmark was developed for diverse and challenging time-series tasks, while TimeSense framework was proposed with a Temporal Sense module for grounding text reasoning in time-series data and using coordinate-based positional embeddings for structural understanding.

Result: TimeSense achieved state-of-the-art performance across various time-series benchmark tasks, excelling especially on complex, multi-dimensional reasoning.

Conclusion: TimeSense validates its capability in harmonizing textual reasoning with temporal features and showcases its superiority over existing methods in time-series analysis.

Abstract: In the time-series domain, an increasing number of works combine text with temporal data to leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for various downstream time-series understanding tasks. This enables a single model to flexibly perform tasks that previously required specialized models for each domain. However, these methods typically rely on text labels for supervision during training, biasing the model toward textual cues while potentially neglecting the full temporal features. Such a bias can lead to outputs that contradict the underlying time-series context. To address this issue, we construct the EvalTS benchmark, comprising 10 tasks across three difficulty levels, from fundamental temporal pattern recognition to complex real-world reasoning, to evaluate models under more challenging and realistic scenarios. We also propose TimeSense, a multimodal framework that makes LLMs proficient in time-series analysis by balancing textual reasoning with a preserved temporal sense. TimeSense incorporates a Temporal Sense module that reconstructs the input time-series within the model's context, ensuring that textual reasoning is grounded in the time-series dynamics. Moreover, to enhance spatial understanding of time-series data, we explicitly incorporate coordinate-based positional embeddings, which provide each time point with spatial context and enable the model to capture structural dependencies more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeSense achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, and it particularly outperforms existing methods on complex multi-dimensional time-series reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks and methods for hate speech detection mainly cater to explicit hate but fail to address implicit or indirect forms of hate speech, which require deeper semantic understanding and remain challenging to detect.

Method: The paper proposes the use of HatePrototypes, derived from language models and optimized for hate speech detection, to enable cross-task transfer and effective detection of explicit and implicit hate speech using as few as 50 examples per class.

Result: HatePrototypes successfully achieved transferable detection capabilities across tasks (explicit and implicit hate speech) and also enabled parameter-free early exiting, showing their efficiency and versatility.

Conclusion: The approach using HatePrototypes offers a resource-efficient and effective way to detect various forms of hate speech. The released resources and tools provide a foundation for future research in this area.

Abstract: Optimization of offensive content moderation models for different types of hateful messages is typically achieved through continued pre-training or fine-tuning on new hate speech benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks mainly address explicit hate toward protected groups and often overlook implicit or indirect hate, such as demeaning comparisons, calls for exclusion or violence, and subtle discriminatory language that still causes harm. While explicit hate can often be captured through surface features, implicit hate requires deeper, full-model semantic processing. In this work, we question the need for repeated fine-tuning and analyze the role of HatePrototypes, class-level vector representations derived from language models optimized for hate speech detection and safety moderation. We find that these prototypes, built from as few as 50 examples per class, enable cross-task transfer between explicit and implicit hate, with interchangeable prototypes across benchmarks. Moreover, we show that parameter-free early exiting with prototypes is effective for both hate types. We release the code, prototype resources, and evaluation scripts to support future research on efficient and transferable hate speech detection.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of domain-specific and context-aware approaches for effective detection of sensitive content, providing a robust solution for social media moderation in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Sugar dating-related content has rapidly proliferated on mainstream social media platforms, giving rise to serious societal and regulatory concerns, including commercialization of intimate relationships and the normalization of transactional relationships.~Detecting such content is highly challenging due to the prevalence of subtle euphemisms, ambiguous linguistic cues, and extreme class imbalance in real-world data.~In this work, we present SugarTextNet, a novel transformer-based framework specifically designed to identify sugar dating-related posts on social media.~SugarTextNet integrates a pretrained transformer encoder, an attention-based cue extractor, and a contextual phrase encoder to capture both salient and nuanced features in user-generated text.~To address class imbalance and enhance minority-class detection, we introduce Context-Aware Focal Loss, a tailored loss function that combines focal loss scaling with contextual weighting.~We evaluate SugarTextNet on a newly curated, manually annotated dataset of 3,067 Chinese social media posts from Sina Weibo, demonstrating that our approach substantially outperforms traditional machine learning models, deep learning baselines, and large language models across multiple metrics.~Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the indispensable role of each component.~Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific, context-aware modeling for sensitive content detection, and provide a robust solution for content moderation in complex, real-world scenarios.

### [121] [How Well Do LLMs Understand Drug Mechanisms? A Knowledge + Reasoning Evaluation Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06418)
*Sunil Mohan,Theofanis Karaletsos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in drug development and personalized medicine, introducing a new dataset to test both factual knowledge and reasoning in novel scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs for drug development and personalized medicine, requiring the models to understand and reason about drug mechanisms effectively.

Method: The authors created a dataset that assesses LLMs on factual knowledge and reasoning capabilities, especially against counterfactual scenarios involving drug mechanisms.

Result: The o4-mini model outperformed OpenAI's o4, o3, o3-mini models, and showed comparable results with the Qwen3-4B-thinking model, highlighting challenges in open versus closed world reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The study concludes that reasoning tasks in open world settings are more demanding for LLMs, particularly when counterfactuals impact internal links within the reasoning chain.

Abstract: Two scientific fields showing increasing interest in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are drug development / repurposing, and personalized medicine. For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely matches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt.

*Lifeng Han,David Lindevelt,Sander Puts,Erik van Mulligen,Suzan Verberne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the application of large language models (LLMs) to extract metaphors in Dutch healthcare communication, focusing on cancer patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve healthcare communication and decision-making by utilizing an understanding of metaphorical language used by cancer patients.

Method: Metaphors were extracted from interview storytelling data and online forums using LLMs with strategies like chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting, verified through a human-in-the-loop approach.

Result: Compiled a corpus of verified metaphorical language called HealthQuote.NL, designed to improve healthcare communication and literacy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that metaphor extraction via LLMs can aid shared decision-making, healthcare communication, and personalized care design.

Abstract: Metaphors and metaphorical language (MLs) play an important role in healthcare communication between clinicians, patients, and patients' family members. In this work, we focus on Dutch language data from cancer patients. We extract metaphors used by patients using two data sources: (1) cancer patient storytelling interview data and (2) online forum data, including patients' posts, comments, and questions to professionals. We investigate how current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) perform on this task by exploring different prompting strategies such as chain of thought reasoning, few-shot learning, and self-prompting. With a human-in-the-loop setup, we verify the extracted metaphors and compile the outputs into a corpus named HealthQuote.NL. We believe the extracted metaphors can support better patient care, for example shared decision making, improved communication between patients and clinicians, and enhanced patient health literacy. They can also inform the design of personalized care pathways. We share prompts and related resources at https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/HealthQuote.NL

### [123] [Towards Resource-Efficient Multimodal Intelligence: Learned Routing among Specialized Expert Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06441)
*Mayank Saini,Arit Kumar Bishwas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a modular framework that routes queries intelligently to minimize costs and maximize efficiency, ensuring performance comparable to premium, expensive models while reducing dependence on them by 67%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high inference costs of large language models (LLMs) and their limitations in real-time, scalable deployment while managing the shortcomings of smaller, cost-effective models on complex or multimodal queries.

Method: The paper proposes a unified framework that uses a learned routing network to intelligently dispatch different types of queries to the most appropriate expert model. For vision tasks, efficient, two-stage, open-source pipelines are optimized, incorporating efficient classical vision components where they hold state-of-the-art performance.

Result: On benchmarks like MMLU and VQA, the framework matches or surpasses the performance of premium monolithic systems while significantly reducing dependence on high-cost models by over 67%.

Conclusion: The framework provides high-quality, scalable AI solutions with efficient resource utilization, demonstrating the feasibility of reducing reliance on costly inference while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: As AI moves beyond text, large language models (LLMs) increasingly power vision, audio, and document understanding; however, their high inference costs hinder real-time, scalable deployment. Conversely, smaller open-source models offer cost advantages but struggle with complex or multimodal queries. We introduce a unified, modular framework that intelligently routes each query - textual, multimodal, or complex - to the most fitting expert model, using a learned routing network that balances cost and quality. For vision tasks, we employ a two-stage open-source pipeline optimized for efficiency and reviving efficient classical vision components where they remain SOTA for sub-tasks. On benchmarks such as Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) and Visual Question Answering (VQA), we match or exceed the performance of always-premium LLM (monolithic systems with one model serving all query types) performance, yet reduce the reliance on costly models by over 67%. With its extensible, multi-agent orchestration, we deliver high-quality, resource-efficient AI at scale.

*Bohan Yu,Wei Huang,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SR-KI is a novel method for embedding structured knowledge bases into large language models, achieving efficient retrieval and dynamic updates directly within models' latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve real-time integration and retrieval of large-scale structured knowledge bases within large language models while avoiding reliance on external retrievers.

Method: Encoded KBs as key-value pairs are injected into LLMs' KV cache using a pretrained encoder. A two-stage training paradigm supervises attention towards relevant entries, enabling end-to-end inference within latent space.

Result: SR-KI integrates up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM efficiently on one A100 GPU, achieves 98% Recall@10 on top-performing tasks, and supports strong performance with 99.75% compression of KBs.

Conclusion: SR-KI introduces efficient knowledge integration and retrieval directly within LLM latent space, ensuring scalability, strong task performance, and massive knowledge compression without external dependency.

Abstract: This paper proposes SR-KI, a novel approach for integrating real-time and large-scale structured knowledge bases (KBs) into large language models (LLMs). SR-KI begins by encoding KBs into key-value pairs using a pretrained encoder, and injects them into LLMs' KV cache. Building on this representation, we employ a two-stage training paradigm: first locating a dedicated retrieval layer within the LLM, and then applying an attention-based loss at this layer to explicitly supervise attention toward relevant KB entries. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods that rely heavily on the performance of external retrievers and multi-stage pipelines, SR-KI supports end-to-end inference by performing retrieval entirely within the models latent space. This design enables efficient compression of injected knowledge and facilitates dynamic knowledge updates. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SR-KI enables the integration of up to 40K KBs into a 7B LLM on a single A100 40GB GPU, and achieves strong retrieval performance, maintaining over 98% Recall@10 on the best-performing task and exceeding 88% on average across all tasks. Task performance on question answering and KB ID generation also demonstrates that SR-KI maintains strong performance while achieving up to 99.75% compression of the injected KBs.

*Quang Phuoc Nguyen,David Anugraha,Felix Gaschi,Jun Bin Cheng,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines whether language model realignment benefits more from using all available languages or selected subsets to improve cross-lingual transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cross-lingual transfer performance for typologically diverse and low-resource languages without relying on exhaustive language coverage or high-quality parallel data.

Method: Conducting controlled experiments with strategically selected subsets of languages to test realignment effectiveness versus full multilingual alignment.

Result: Realignment proved effective for low-resource languages, and linguistically diverse subsets matched or outperformed full multilingual alignment for unseen low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Strategic language subset selection can optimize realignment, reducing data collection effort while maintaining efficiency and robustness for cross-lingual transfer.

Abstract: Realignment is a promising strategy to improve cross-lingual transfer in multilingual language models. However, empirical results are mixed and often unreliable, particularly for typologically distant or low-resource languages (LRLs) compared to English. Moreover, word realignment tools often rely on high-quality parallel data, which can be scarce or noisy for many LRLs. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study to investigate whether realignment truly benefits from using all available languages, or if strategically selected subsets can offer comparable or even improved cross-lingual transfer, and study the impact on LRLs. Our controlled experiments show that realignment can be particularly effective for LRLs and that using carefully selected, linguistically diverse subsets can match full multilingual alignment, and even outperform it for unseen LRLs. This indicates that effective realignment does not require exhaustive language coverage and can reduce data collection overhead, while remaining both efficient and robust when guided by informed language selection.

*Amit LeVi,Raz Lapid,Rom Himelstein,Yaniv Nemcovsky,Ravid Shwartz Ziv,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces task-aware methods for post-training quantization (PTQ) to enhance memory efficiency in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining task-specific performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are efficient but often overpowered for specific tasks, requiring methods to optimize memory and computation without losing task-specific accuracy.

Method: The authors propose two approaches: TAQ, which uses task-conditioned statistics for bitwidth allocation, and TAQO, which employs direct layer sensitivity tests to guide quantization, preserving precision for task-relevant layers and aggressively compressing others.

Result: The proposed methods, TAQ and TAQO, significantly outperform existing quantization approaches, achieving better task accuracy across different models while reducing precision requirements and maintaining stable task sensitivity profiles.

Conclusion: TAQ and TAQO methods provide efficient solutions for creating task-specific models, enabling LLMs to perform well with reduced precision, memory usage, and latency in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks, yet many applications require only limited capabilities, making large variants inefficient in memory and latency. Existing approaches often combine distillation and quantization, but most post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are task-agnostic, ignoring how task-specific signals are distributed across layers. In this work, we propose to use hidden representations that encode task-salient signals as a guideline for quantization. In order to fully utilize our innovative idea, this paper compares two new task-aware PTQ methods: Task-Aware Quantization (TAQ), which allocates bitwidths using task-conditioned statistics from hidden activations, and TAQO, which allocates precision based on direct layer sensitivity tests. From a small calibration set, these approaches identify task-relevant layers, preserving their precision while aggressively quantizing the rest. This yields stable task sensitivity profiles and efficient task-specialized models. Across models, TAQ and TAQO outperform the baselines; TAQ leads on Phi-4, while TAQO leads on Llama-3.1, Qwen3, and Qwen2.5. For instances, on Phi-4 it achieves 42.33 EM / 50.81 F1, far surpassing Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) (2.25 / 7.07), while remaining within < 1.0% of the original accuracy at lower average precision.

*Xiaonan Luo,Yue Huang,Ping He,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RefineLab is the first framework aimed at improving QA datasets using Large Language Models, focusing on quality attributes like domain coverage and factual fidelity under token-budget constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QA datasets often suffer from gaps in domain coverage, misaligned difficulties, and inconsistencies, even when crafted by experts. The rising use of generative models has further exacerbated these quality issues.

Method: RefineLab employs a set of target quality attributes and token-budget constraints as refinement objectives. It utilizes selective editing on QA samples with operations like rephrasing and distractor replacement. An assignment module optimizes refinement strategies to enhance dataset quality within budget constraints.

Result: Experiments prove RefineLab's capability to reduce divergence from expert datasets in aspects such as coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality.

Conclusion: RefineLab provides a scalable, efficient, and customizable framework for creating high-quality QA datasets, addressing persistent issues and offering a reliable means for LLM evaluation.

Abstract: High-quality Question-Answer (QA) datasets are foundational for reliable Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, yet even expert-crafted datasets exhibit persistent gaps in domain coverage, misaligned difficulty distributions, and factual inconsistencies. The recent surge in generative model-powered datasets has compounded these quality challenges. In this work, we introduce RefineLab, the first LLM-driven framework that automatically refines raw QA textual data into high-quality datasets under a controllable token-budget constraint. RefineLab takes a set of target quality attributes (such as coverage and difficulty balance) as refinement objectives, and performs selective edits within a predefined token budget to ensure practicality and efficiency. In essence, RefineLab addresses a constrained optimization problem: improving the quality of QA samples as much as possible while respecting resource limitations. With a set of available refinement operations (e.g., rephrasing, distractor replacement), RefineLab takes as input the original dataset, a specified set of target quality dimensions, and a token budget, and determines which refinement operations should be applied to each QA sample. This process is guided by an assignment module that selects optimal refinement strategies to maximize overall dataset quality while adhering to the budget constraint. Experiments demonstrate that RefineLab consistently narrows divergence from expert datasets across coverage, difficulty alignment, factual fidelity, and distractor quality. RefineLab pioneers a scalable, customizable path to reproducible dataset design, with broad implications for LLM evaluation.

*Oluwadara Kalejaiye,Luel Hagos Beyene,David Ifeoluwa Adelani,Mmekut-Mfon Gabriel Edet,Aniefon Daniel Akpan,Eno-Abasi Urua,Anietie Andy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'ibom', a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in underrepresented Coastal Nigerian languages, and evaluates current LLMs performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of NLP research and data for languages spoken in Nigeria, beyond the commonly studied Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba, despite Nigeria's linguistic diversity.

Method: The authors developed the 'ibom' dataset to work on machine translation and topic classification for four Coastal Nigerian languages (Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, Oro). They extended the Flores-200 benchmark and aligned texts with SIB-200 classifications.

Result: Current LLMs performed poorly in machine translation for these languages in zero-and-few shot settings. Few-shot samples showed improved performance for topic classification as the number of shots increased.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for more inclusive datasets and shows potential improvement in topic classification with appropriate few-shot examples. It opens further research possibilities for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a population of more than 200 million people. More than 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria and it is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. Despite this, natural language processing (NLP) research has mostly focused on the following four languages: Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba (i.e <1% of the languages spoken in Nigeria). This is in part due to the unavailability of textual data in these languages to train and apply NLP algorithms. In this work, we introduce ibom -- a dataset for machine translation and topic classification in four Coastal Nigerian languages from the Akwa Ibom State region: Anaang, Efik, Ibibio, and Oro. These languages are not represented in Google Translate or in major benchmarks such as Flores-200 or SIB-200. We focus on extending Flores-200 benchmark to these languages, and further align the translated texts with topic labels based on SIB-200 classification dataset. Our evaluation shows that current LLMs perform poorly on machine translation for these languages in both zero-and-few shot settings. However, we find the few-shot samples to steadily improve topic classification with more shots.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rep2Text framework decodes original input text from last-token representations in large language models, recovering semantic and textual content efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to uncover the potential of recovering original input text from compressed representations, providing insight into the internal mechanisms of large language models.

Method: The paper introduces Rep2Text, utilizing a trainable adapter that maps model representations to a decoding model’s embedding space, allowing autoregressive reconstruction of original text.

Result: Experiments show that Rep2Text recovers over half the information from 16-token sequences, preserving semantic integrity. Longer sequences show reduced token recovery but maintain strong semantics.

Conclusion: Rep2Text highlights the recoverable information in compressed representations, contributing to understanding LLM mechanics and showcasing robust generalization to out-of-distribution data like medical texts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across diverse tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this work, we address a fundamental question: to what extent can the original input text be recovered from a single last-token representation within an LLM? We propose Rep2Text, a novel framework for decoding full text from last-token representations. Rep2Text employs a trainable adapter that projects a target model's internal representations into the embedding space of a decoding language model, which then autoregressively reconstructs the input text. Experiments on various model combinations (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B-v0.1, Llama-3.2-3B) demonstrate that, on average, over half of the information in 16-token sequences can be recovered from this compressed representation while maintaining strong semantic integrity and coherence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals an information bottleneck effect: longer sequences exhibit decreased token-level recovery while preserving strong semantic integrity. Besides, our framework also demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution medical data.

TL;DR: TabRAG improves RAG pipelines by specializing in table-heavy document parsing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address challenges in processing tabular data within parsing-based RAG pipelines, which often suffer reduced performance compared to fine-tuning approaches.

Method: TabRAG utilizes structured language representations to enhance the parsing and processing of table-heavy documents for better retrieval and generation performance.

Result: TabRAG demonstrates superior performance over popular parsing-based methods, ensuring improved data retrieval and generation from tabular documents.

Conclusion: TabRAG is an effective and computationally efficient solution for handling table-heavy data within RAG pipelines, contributing improvements in both generation and retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Ingesting data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves either fine-tuning the embedding model directly on the target corpus or parsing documents for embedding model encoding. The former, while accurate, incurs high computational hardware requirements, while the latter suffers from suboptimal performance when extracting tabular data. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRAG, a parsing-based RAG pipeline designed to tackle table-heavy documents via structured language representations. TabRAG outperforms existing popular parsing-based methods for generation and retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/jacobyhsi/TabRAG.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models used in clinical audio settings display significant biases based on voice profiles, affecting their medical decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models exhibit biases in clinical decision-making when transitioning from text to audio interactions.

Method: Evaluated 170 clinical cases using synthesized speech from 36 unique voice profiles varying in age, gender, and emotion.

Result: Observed modality bias, age disparities, and challenges in recognizing emotion, leading to flawed clinical recommendations.

Conclusion: Bias-aware architectures are urgently required before deploying audio-based language models in healthcare.

Abstract: As large language models transition from text-based interfaces to audio interactions in clinical settings, they might introduce new vulnerabilities through paralinguistic cues in audio. We evaluated these models on 170 clinical cases, each synthesized into speech from 36 distinct voice profiles spanning variations in age, gender, and emotion. Our findings reveal a severe modality bias: surgical recommendations for audio inputs varied by as much as 35% compared to identical text-based inputs, with one model providing 80% fewer recommendations. Further analysis uncovered age disparities of up to 12% between young and elderly voices, which persisted in most models despite chain-of-thought prompting. While explicit reasoning successfully eliminated gender bias, the impact of emotion was not detected due to poor recognition performance. These results demonstrate that audio LLMs are susceptible to making clinical decisions based on a patient's voice characteristics rather than medical evidence, a flaw that risks perpetuating healthcare disparities. We conclude that bias-aware architectures are essential and urgently needed before the clinical deployment of these models.

*Subhojit Ghimire*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies biases in AI-driven moderation systems by benchmarking toxicity detection in African-American English (AAE) versus Standard American English (SAE), uncovering systematic disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fairness and address concerns regarding biased algorithmic moderation impacting specific linguistic groups.

Method: Quantitative benchmarking using the toxicity detection model (unitary/toxic-bert) and development of an interactive tool to demonstrate real-world impact of biases.

Result: The study discovered that the model scores AAE as significantly more toxic and hateful compared to SAE, highlighting systematic bias.

Conclusion: Statistical evidence reveals disparities in AI moderation systems, and the interactive tool promotes critical awareness of operational discrimination caused by biased algorithms.

Abstract: Now that AI-driven moderation has become pervasive in everyday life, we often hear claims that "the AI is biased". While this is often said jokingly, the light-hearted remark reflects a deeper concern. How can we be certain that an online post flagged as "inappropriate" was not simply the victim of a biased algorithm? This paper investigates this problem using a dual approach. First, I conduct a quantitative benchmark of a widely used toxicity model (unitary/toxic-bert) to measure performance disparity between text in African-American English (AAE) and Standard American English (SAE). The benchmark reveals a clear, systematic bias: on average, the model scores AAE text as 1.8 times more toxic and 8.8 times higher for "identity hate". Second, I introduce an interactive pedagogical tool that makes these abstract biases tangible. The tool's core mechanic, a user-controlled "sensitivity threshold," demonstrates that the biased score itself is not the only harm; instead, the more-concerning harm is the human-set, seemingly neutral policy that ultimately operationalises discrimination. This work provides both statistical evidence of disparate impact and a public-facing tool designed to foster critical AI literacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DIA-REFINE framework for improving dialect translation using external classifiers, new metrics (DFS and TDR), and conducts experiments to address challenges in standard-dialect translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in translating standard to dialect languages due to dialect gap in LLMs and limitations of n-gram metrics.

Method: An iterative framework (DIA-REFINE) combining translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. Two novel evaluation metrics (DFS and TDR) assess fidelity and success in dialect translation.

Result: Improved dialect fidelity and translation performance across Korean dialect experiments. Distinction between genuine dialect translation attempts and false successes using proposed metrics.

Conclusion: DIA-REFINE enhances dialect translation and addresses evaluation distortions in a structured framework, offering insights into model responsiveness and performance improvement.

Abstract: Standard-to-dialect machine translation remains challenging due to a persistent dialect gap in large language models and evaluation distortions inherent in n-gram metrics, which favor source copying over authentic dialect translation. In this paper, we propose the dialect refinement (DIA-REFINE) framework, which guides LLMs toward faithful target dialect outputs through an iterative loop of translation, verification, and feedback using external dialect classifiers. To address the limitations of n-gram-based metrics, we introduce the dialect fidelity score (DFS) to quantify linguistic shift and the target dialect ratio (TDR) to measure the success of dialect translation. Experiments on Korean dialects across zero-shot and in-context learning baselines demonstrate that DIA-REFINE consistently enhances dialect fidelity. The proposed metrics distinguish between False Success cases, where high n-gram scores obscure failures in dialectal translation, and True Attempt cases, where genuine attempts at dialectal translation yield low n-gram scores. We also observed that models exhibit varying degrees of responsiveness to the framework, and that integrating in-context examples further improves the translation of dialectal expressions. Our work establishes a robust framework for goal-directed, inclusive dialect translation, providing both rigorous evaluation and critical insights into model performance.

### [134] [Textual Self-attention Network: Test-Time Preference Optimization through Textual Gradient-based Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06682)
*Shibing Mo,Haoyang Ruan,Kai Wu,Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN) for test-time preference optimization in large language models, which synthesizes strengths of multiple candidate responses without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing test-time methods lack systematic mechanisms to combine strengths of multiple candidate responses, which hampers optimal alignment of outputs to human preferences.

Method: The TSAN uses natural language-based self-attention to analyze, weigh, and synthesize multiple responses, iteratively generating a preference-aligned output in a textual gradient space.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method in producing high-quality, preference-aligned responses.

Conclusion: TSAN achieves superior test-time optimization in LLMs without any parameter updates, highlighting its potential as a scalable alternative to supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences typically requires expensive supervised fine-tuning. Recent test-time methods leverage textual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single candidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze, weigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a mechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects (e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements may produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual Self-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference optimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention entirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple candidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their relevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths into a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned textual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that with just three test-time iterations on a base SFT model, TSAN outperforms supervised models like Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and surpasses the current state-of-the-art test-time alignment method by effectively leveraging multiple candidate solutions.

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval techniques (RAG) face performance issues in medicine due to challenges in evidence relevance, selection, and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of rapidly evolving medical data and providing evidence-grounded, verifiable responses using RAG-enhanced LLMs.

Method: Expert evaluation of RAG's efficacy was conducted on medical queries using GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, decomposing the RAG process into evidence retrieval, selection, and response generation.

Result: Standard RAG led to performance degradation in evidence relevance, selection precision (41-43%), and recall (27-49%), alongside reduced response factuality and completeness.

Conclusion: RAG needs re-evaluation in medical applications; deliberate strategies like evidence filtering and query reformulation can mitigate performance issues and enhance reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of medicine, yet two fundamental challenges persist: keeping up with rapidly evolving medical knowledge and providing verifiable, evidence-grounded reasoning. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to address these limitations by supplementing model outputs with retrieved evidence. However, whether RAG reliably achieves these goals remains unclear. Here, we present the most comprehensive expert evaluation of RAG in medicine to date. Eighteen medical experts contributed a total of 80,502 annotations, assessing 800 model outputs generated by GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B across 200 real-world patient and USMLE-style queries. We systematically decomposed the RAG pipeline into three components: (i) evidence retrieval (relevance of retrieved passages), (ii) evidence selection (accuracy of evidence usage), and (iii) response generation (factuality and completeness of outputs). Contrary to expectation, standard RAG often degraded performance: only 22% of top-16 passages were relevant, evidence selection remained weak (precision 41-43%, recall 27-49%), and factuality and completeness dropped by up to 6% and 5%, respectively, compared with non-RAG variants. Retrieval and evidence selection remain key failure points for the model, contributing to the overall performance drop. We further show that simple yet effective strategies, including evidence filtering and query reformulation, substantially mitigate these issues, improving performance on MedMCQA and MedXpertQA by up to 12% and 8.2%, respectively. These findings call for re-examining RAG's role in medicine and highlight the importance of stage-aware evaluation and deliberate system design for reliable medical LLM applications.

### [137] [Sensitivity of Small Language Models to Fine-tuning Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06763)
*Nicy Scaria,Silvester John Joseph Kennedy,Deepak Subramani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small Language Models (SLMs) experience major vulnerabilities to data contamination during instruction tuning, especially syntactic transformations like character reversal, which can lead to catastrophic failures across all models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are being widely used in resource-constrained settings, yet their robustness against contaminated data during instruction tuning remains unclear.

Method: The paper evaluates 23 SLMs (ranging from 270M to 4B parameters) across various model families using syntactic and semantic data transformations at different contamination levels (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%).

Result: SLMs display asymmetrical vulnerabilities; syntactic contamination severely degrades performance, while semantic transformation effects are less catastrophic but reveal a "capability curse" making larger models more susceptible to harmful instructions.

Conclusion: SLMs show disproportionate sensitivity to syntactic contamination, and model robustness assumptions need revisiting. Contamination-aware training protocols are necessary for deployment in real-world environments.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly being deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet their behavioral robustness to data contamination during instruction tuning remains poorly understood. We systematically investigate the contamination sensitivity of 23 SLMs (270M to 4B parameters) across multiple model families by measuring susceptibility to syntactic and semantic transformation types during instruction tuning: syntactic transformations (character and word reversal) and semantic transformations (irrelevant and counterfactual responses), each applied at contamination levels of 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\%. Our results reveal fundamental asymmetries in vulnerability patterns: syntactic transformations cause catastrophic performance degradation, with character reversal producing near-complete failure across all models regardless of size or family, while semantic transformations demonstrate distinct threshold behaviors and greater resilience in core linguistic capabilities. Critically, we discover a ``\textit{capability curse}" where larger, more capable models become more susceptible to learning semantic corruptions, effectively following harmful instructions more readily, while our analysis of base versus instruction-tuned variants reveals that alignment provides inconsistent robustness benefits, sometimes even reducing resilience. Our work establishes three core contributions: (1) empirical evidence of SLMs' disproportionate vulnerability to syntactic pattern contamination, (2) identification of asymmetric sensitivity patterns between syntactic and semantic transformations, and (3) systematic evaluation protocols for contamination robustness assessment. These findings have immediate deployment implications, suggesting that current robustness assumptions may not hold for smaller models and highlighting the need for contamination-aware training protocols.

*Ruiheng Liu,XiaoBing Chen,Jinyu Zhang,Qiongwen Zhang,Yu Zhang,Bailong Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeNlidb, a new framework to address privacy and security challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB). SafeNlidb enhances secure SQL generation without needing human preference annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have spurred growth in NLIDB applications but raise privacy and security issues, such as unintentional data exposure and vulnerability to inference-based attacks during interactions.

Method: SafeNlidb combines implicit security reasoning with SQL generation via hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data. It employs reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization for fine-grained security-aware SQL generation.

Result: Experiments show that SafeNlidb surpasses larger-scale LLMs and ideal baselines in security, all while maintaining high functionality.

Conclusion: SafeNlidb offers an effective solution for secure database interactions, addressing critical LLM-related privacy and security issues with superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven significant progress in Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB). However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has raised critical privacy and security concerns. During interactions, LLMs may unintentionally expose confidential database contents or be manipulated by attackers to exfiltrate data through seemingly benign queries. While current efforts typically rely on rule-based heuristics or LLM agents to mitigate this leakage risk, these methods still struggle with complex inference-based attacks, suffer from high false positive rates, and often compromise the reliability of SQL queries. To address these challenges, we propose \textsc{SafeNlidb}, a novel privacy-security alignment framework for LLM-based NLIDB. The framework features an automated pipeline that generates hybrid chain-of-thought interaction data from scratch, seamlessly combining implicit security reasoning with SQL generation. Additionally, we introduce reasoning warm-up and alternating preference optimization to overcome the multi-preference oscillations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling LLMs to produce security-aware SQL through fine-grained reasoning without the need for human-annotated preference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both larger-scale LLMs and ideal-setting baselines, achieving significant security improvements while preserving high utility.WARNING: This work may contain content that is offensive and harmful!

*Dhananjay Ram,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Focal Attention, which modifies the softmax attention in transformers to sharpen focus, improving performance and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The standard softmax attention often generates noisy distributions, hindering feature selection, particularly for long contexts in transformer models.

Method: Focal Attention modifies attention by adjusting the softmax temperature (fixed or learnable), sharpening the focus on relevant tokens and suppressing irrelevant ones.

Result: Focal Attention improves scalability, allows performance with fewer parameters/training data, and offers substantial gains (17%-82%) on long-context tasks across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Focal Attention effectively enhances transformer models by sharpening attention, improving accuracy, efficiency, and scalability for diverse applications.

Abstract: Attention is a core component of transformer architecture, whether encoder-only, decoder-only, or encoder-decoder model. However, the standard softmax attention often produces noisy probability distribution, which can impair effective feature selection at every layer of these models, particularly for long contexts. We propose Focal Attention, a simple yet effective modification that sharpens the attention distribution by controlling the softmax temperature, either as a fixed hyperparameter or as a learnable parameter during training. This sharpening enables the model to concentrate on the most relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones. Empirically, Focal Attention scales more favorably than standard transformer with respect to model size, training data, and context length. Across diverse benchmarks, it achieves the same accuracy with up to 42% fewer parameters or 33% less training data. On long-context tasks, it delivers substantial relative improvements ranging from 17% to 82%, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world applications.

*Puzhen Su,Haoran Yin,Yongzhu Miao,Jintao Tang,Shasha Li,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DA4ICL, a framework enhancing large language models (LLMs) in detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) via strategic demo selection and signal anchoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with Alzheimer's detection due to the homogeneous context of narrative transcripts and lack of pre-trained task cognition.

Method: DA4ICL employs Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval (DCR) to expand demo diversity and Projected Vector Anchoring (PVA) to embed fine-grained signals at each Transformer layer.

Result: DA4ICL demonstrated significant improvements in AD detection across three benchmarks, surpassing traditional in-context learning (ICL) and task vector methods.

Conclusion: DA4ICL sets a new standard for adapting LLMs to fine-grained, out-of-distribution (OOD) and low-resource tasks.

Abstract: Detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) from narrative transcripts challenges large language models (LLMs): pre-training rarely covers this out-of-distribution task, and all transcript demos describe the same scene, producing highly homogeneous contexts. These factors cripple both the model's built-in task knowledge (\textbf{task cognition}) and its ability to surface subtle, class-discriminative cues (\textbf{contextual perception}). Because cognition is fixed after pre-training, improving in-context learning (ICL) for AD detection hinges on enriching perception through better demonstration (demo) sets. We demonstrate that standard ICL quickly saturates, its demos lack diversity (context width) and fail to convey fine-grained signals (context depth), and that recent task vector (TV) approaches improve broad task adaptation by injecting TV into the LLMs' hidden states (HSs), they are ill-suited for AD detection due to the mismatch of injection granularity, strength and position. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce \textbf{DA4ICL}, a demo-centric anchoring framework that jointly expands context width via \emph{\textbf{Diverse and Contrastive Retrieval}} (DCR) and deepens each demo's signal via \emph{\textbf{Projected Vector Anchoring}} (PVA) at every Transformer layer. Across three AD benchmarks, DA4ICL achieves large, stable gains over both ICL and TV baselines, charting a new paradigm for fine-grained, OOD and low-resource LLM adaptation.

*Hung-Yang Sung,Chien-Chun Wang,Kuan-Tang Huang,Tien-Hong Lo,Yu-Sheng Tsao,Yung-Chang Hsu,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLiFT-ASR, a framework that effectively reduces errors in Taiwanese Hokkien ASR by progressively training on phonetic and textual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated data makes ASR for low-resource languages like Taiwanese Hokkien challenging. Direct training on either phonetic or Han-character annotations fails to balance phonetic details and broader linguistic coverage.

Method: The proposed CLiFT-ASR framework utilizes Mandarin HuBERT models and employs a two-stage training process: first learning phonetic and tonal cues via Tai-lo annotations and then focusing on vocabulary and syntax through Han-character transcriptions.

Result: Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus show that CLiFT-ASR achieved a 24.88% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: CLiFT-ASR provides an effective, parameter-efficient approach for ASR in Taiwanese Hokkien and could be adapted for other low-resource language scenarios.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages such as Taiwanese Hokkien is difficult due to the scarcity of annotated data. However, direct fine-tuning on Han-character transcriptions often fails to capture detailed phonetic and tonal cues, while training only on romanization lacks lexical and syntactic coverage. In addition, prior studies have rarely explored staged strategies that integrate both annotation types. To address this gap, we present CLiFT-ASR, a cross-lingual fine-tuning framework that builds on Mandarin HuBERT models and progressively adapts them to Taiwanese Hokkien. The framework employs a two-stage process in which it first learns acoustic and tonal representations from phonetic Tai-lo annotations and then captures vocabulary and syntax from Han-character transcriptions. This progressive adaptation enables effective alignment between speech sounds and orthographic structures. Experiments on the TAT-MOE corpus demonstrate that CLiFT-ASR achieves a 24.88\% relative reduction in character error rate (CER) compared with strong baselines. The results indicate that CLiFT-ASR provides an effective and parameter-efficient solution for Taiwanese Hokkien ASR and that it has potential to benefit other low-resource language scenarios.

### [142] [Inclusion of Role into Named Entity Recognition and Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06886)
*Neelesh Kumar Shukla,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses Entity Role Detection by modeling it as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Retrieval tasks, exploring how roles can be defined and retrieved effectively in context-sensitive scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a challenge in identifying and assigning contextual roles to entities for tasks like Information Extraction, Question-Answering, etc., where the roles depend on domain-specific subtypes and attributes.

Method: The study models Entity Role Detection as NER (using sequence tagging) and Entity Retrieval tasks. It explores automated ways of learning representative words/phrases, building representations of roles/entities, and using context-dependent information from small datasets.

Result: Methods were developed to represent roles and entities effectively using limited domain-agnostic data and explored context-sensitive approaches across sentences and documents.

Conclusion: Entity Role Detection can be approached by leveraging NER and Entity Retrieval methods, using limited datasets and exploiting domain-agnostic strategies to achieve context-sensitive understanding.

Abstract: Most of the Natural Language Processing sys- tems are involved in entity-based processing for several tasks like Information Extraction, Question-Answering, Text-Summarization and so on. A new challenge comes when entities play roles according to their act or attributes in certain context. Entity Role Detection is the task of assigning such roles to the entities. Usu- ally real-world entities are of types: person, lo- cation and organization etc. Roles could be con- sidered as domain-dependent subtypes of these types. In the cases, where retrieving a subset of entities based on their roles is needed, poses the problem of defining the role and entities having those roles. This paper presents the study of study of solving Entity Role Detection prob- lem by modeling it as Named Entity Recogni- tion (NER) and Entity Retrieval/Ranking task. In NER, these roles could be considered as mutually exclusive classes and standard NER methods like sequence tagging could be used. For Entity Retrieval, Roles could be formulated as Query and entities as Collection on which the query needs to be executed. The aspect of Entity Retrieval task, which is different than document retrieval task is that the entities and roles against which they need to be retrieved are indirectly described. We have formulated au- tomated ways of learning representative words and phrases and building representations of roles and entities using them. We have also explored different contexts like sentence and document. Since the roles depend upon con- text, so it is not always possible to have large domain-specific dataset or knowledge bases for learning purposes, so we have tried to exploit the information from small dataset in domain- agnostic way.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper has developed and released English and Czech text corpora generated with large language models (LLMs) for linguistic comparison with human-written texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a resource for studying linguistic differences and similarities between human-written and LLM-generated texts across multiple genres and topics.

Method: The authors generated text corpora in English and Czech using LLMs from various providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, among others), replicating reference human corpora with detailed annotation following the Universal Dependencies standard.

Result: The corpora contain millions of tokens—English (~27M) and Czech (~21.5M)—and are based on diverse genres, topics, and authors. They are publicly available under open licenses and accessible through the Czech National Corpus.

Conclusion: These corpora provide a valuable, openly accessible resource for linguistic research and comparative analysis of LLM and human-generated texts across two languages.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search interface of the Czech National Corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduGuardBench is a benchmark to assess Large Language Models' professional role-playing skills and ethical safety in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for assessing professional fidelity and ensuring ethical safety in Educational Large Language Model simulations.

Method: Utilized dual-component benchmark, EduGuardBench, combining Role-playing Fidelity Score and adversarial diagnostic tools targeting safety vulnerabilities, academic misconduct, and education-specific harms.

Result: Experiments on 14 models showed reasoning models excel in fidelity, mid-sized models most vulnerable, and identified models capable of turning harmful requests into teachable moments.

Conclusion: EduGuardBench establishes a framework for assessing ethical and professional alignment in AI for education, highlighting dynamics crucial for deploying trustworthy AI systems in educational settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models for Simulating Professions (SP-LLMs), particularly as teachers, are pivotal for personalized education. However, ensuring their professional competence and ethical safety is a critical challenge, as existing benchmarks fail to measure role-playing fidelity or address the unique teaching harms inherent in educational scenarios. To address this, we propose EduGuardBench, a dual-component benchmark. It assesses professional fidelity using a Role-playing Fidelity Score (RFS) while diagnosing harms specific to the teaching profession. It also probes safety vulnerabilities using persona-based adversarial prompts targeting both general harms and, particularly, academic misconduct, evaluated with metrics including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and a three-tier Refusal Quality assessment. Our extensive experiments on 14 leading models reveal a stark polarization in performance. While reasoning-oriented models generally show superior fidelity, incompetence remains the dominant failure mode across most models. The adversarial tests uncovered a counterintuitive scaling paradox, where mid-sized models can be the most vulnerable, challenging monotonic safety assumptions. Critically, we identified a powerful Educational Transformation Effect: the safest models excel at converting harmful requests into teachable moments by providing ideal Educational Refusals. This capacity is strongly negatively correlated with ASR, revealing a new dimension of advanced AI safety. EduGuardBench thus provides a reproducible framework that moves beyond siloed knowledge tests toward a holistic assessment of professional, ethical, and pedagogical alignment, uncovering complex dynamics essential for deploying trustworthy AI in education.

### [145] [RPTS: Tree-Structured Reasoning Process Scoring for Faithful Multimodal Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06899)
*Haofeng Wang,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a metric that assesses reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by analyzing hierarchical reasoning steps and their intermodal relationships. A new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, is created to evaluate LVLMs in multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LVLMs inadequately evaluate reasoning processes, especially intermodal relationships. Current methods overlook flawed reasoning leading to correct answers and primarily focus on incorrect reasoning.

Method: The authors propose RPTS, a tree-based metric that organizes reasoning into a tree structure and assigns weighted scores. RPTS evaluates reasoning correctness and identifies reasoning flaws. They also constructed RPTS-Eval, a benchmark with 374 images and 390 reasoning instances, to validate RPTS and examine intermodal relationships.

Result: RPTS identifies reasoning gaps in leading LVLMs such as GPT4o and Llava-Next. The benchmark highlights distinctions between open-source and commercial LVLMs, revealing limitations in their multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RPTS and its benchmark offer a robust framework for assessing and advancing multimodal reasoning in LVLMs with a focus on intermodal reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in multimodal reasoning and have shown impressive performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, most of these benchmarks evaluate models primarily through multiple-choice or short-answer formats, which do not take the reasoning process into account. Although some benchmarks assess the reasoning process, their methods are often overly simplistic and only examine reasoning when answers are incorrect. This approach overlooks scenarios where flawed reasoning leads to correct answers. In addition, these benchmarks do not consider the impact of intermodal relationships on reasoning. To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning Process Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning processes. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree and leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness scores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not only evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints where the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world multimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374 images and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable visual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree. Furthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate how intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated representative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in multimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and closed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute to the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning.

*Fangqi Dai,Xingjian Jiang,Zizhuang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD), which outperforms existing methods in detecting texts edited or generated by advanced LLMs, even in adversarial and black-box scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the problem of identifying machine-generated or machine-revised text in order to prevent misinformation and mitigate social issues. They highlight the limitations of existing methods when dealing with advanced LLM outputs or adversarial scenarios.

Method: HLPD utilizes a process called Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), which uses reward alignment to make detection models better at distinguishing human-like writing from machine-generated or machine-revised text. It evaluates model capability using a complex adversarial framework with diverse revision scenarios.

Result: HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD and surpasses Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56% when detecting GPT-revised texts. It also achieves the highest AUROC scores for texts generated by advanced LLMs, outperforming ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

Conclusion: HLPD demonstrates superior performance in detecting complex adversarially modified and advanced LLM-generated texts. This approach holds promise for reliably identifying machine-influenced text and mitigating associated risks such as misinformation.

Abstract: To prevent misinformation and social issues arising from trustworthy-looking content generated by LLMs, it is crucial to develop efficient and reliable methods for identifying the source of texts. Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

*Zhenliang Zhang,Xinyu Hu,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCOPE, an inference-time method to mitigate copyright infringement using semantic-space control, avoiding the need for external filters or parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can unintentionally reproduce copyrighted content, creating legal risks for downstream applications. Currently available solutions rely on external filters that increase complexity and may not address semantically paraphrased content.

Method: The authors proposed SCOPE, an approach leveraging a sparse autoencoder (SAE) that projects hidden states into a high-dimensional semantic space. It identifies a subspace sensitive to copyright and clamps its activations during decoding, requiring no external blocklists.

Result: Experiments on established benchmarks show that SCOPE reduces copyright infringement effectively without impacting overall model performance. Additionally, interpretability analyses reveal that the identified subspace relates to high-level semantics.

Conclusion: SCOPE provides a practical and efficient method to address copyright concerns in large language models, enhancing semantic control and avoiding deployment complexities.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes inadvertently reproduce passages that are copyrighted, exposing downstream applications to legal risk. Most existing studies for inference-time defences focus on surface-level token matching and rely on external blocklists or filters, which add deployment complexity and may overlook semantically paraphrased leakage. In this work, we reframe copyright infringement mitigation as intrinsic semantic-space control and introduce SCOPE, an inference-time method that requires no parameter updates or auxiliary filters. Specifically, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) projects hidden states into a high-dimensional, near-monosemantic space; benefiting from this representation, we identify a copyright-sensitive subspace and clamp its activations during decoding. Experiments on widely recognized benchmarks show that SCOPE mitigates copyright infringement without degrading general utility. Further interpretability analyses confirm that the isolated subspace captures high-level semantics.

Conclusion: Probe prompting is a promising method that enhances mechanistic interpretability of neural networks while reducing time and effort; resources are provided for community adoption.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand neural networks by identifying which learned features mediate specific behaviors. Attribution graphs reveal these feature pathways, but interpreting them requires extensive manual analysis -- a single prompt can take approximately 2 hours for an experienced circuit tracer. We present probe prompting, an automated pipeline that transforms attribution graphs into compact, interpretable subgraphs built from concept-aligned supernodes. Starting from a seed prompt and target logit, we select high-influence features, generate concept-targeted yet context-varying probes, and group features by cross-prompt activation signatures into Semantic, Relationship, and Say-X categories using transparent decision rules.
  Across five prompts including classic "capitals" circuits, probe-prompted subgraphs preserve high explanatory coverage while compressing complexity (Completeness 0.83, mean across circuits; Replacement 0.54). Compared to geometric clustering baselines, concept-aligned groups exhibit higher behavioral coherence: 2.3x higher peak-token consistency (0.425 vs 0.183) and 5.8x higher activation-pattern similarity (0.762 vs 0.130), despite lower geometric compactness. Entity-swap tests reveal a layerwise hierarchy: early-layer features transfer robustly (64% transfer rate, mean layer 6.3), while late-layer Say-X features specialize for output promotion (mean layer 16.4), supporting a backbone-and-specialization view of transformer computation.
  We release code (https://github.com/peppinob-ol/attribution-graph-probing), an interactive demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Peppinob/attribution-graph-probing), and minimal artifacts enabling immediate reproduction and community adoption.

TL;DR: LMT introduces large-scale multilingual translation models improving language coverage and addressing translation challenges using innovative techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in MMT such as broad language coverage, English-centric bias, and translation quality inconsistencies.

Method: Developed LMT focusing on Chinese and English, applying strategic downsampling and Parallel Multilingual Prompting for better multilingual translation.

Result: LMT achieved state-of-the-art performance with the 4B model outperforming larger models like Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B.

Conclusion: LMT provides significant advancements in MMT and serves as a strong baseline for future scalable, high-quality multilingual translation.

Abstract: Large language models have significantly advanced Multilingual Machine Translation (MMT), yet the broad language coverage, consistent translation quality, and English-centric bias remain open challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{LMT}, a suite of \textbf{L}arge-scale \textbf{M}ultilingual \textbf{T}ranslation models centered on both Chinese and English, covering 60 languages and 234 translation directions. During development, we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon of \textbf{directional degeneration}, where symmetric multi-way fine-tuning data overemphasize reverse directions (X $\to$ En/Zh), leading to excessive many-to-one mappings and degraded translation quality. We propose \textbf{Strategic Downsampling}, a simple yet effective method to mitigate this degeneration. In addition, we design \textbf{Parallel Multilingual Prompting (PMP)}, which leverages typologically related auxiliary languages to enhance cross-lingual transfer. Through rigorous data curation and refined adaptation strategies, LMT achieves SOTA performance among models of comparable language coverage, with our 4B model (LMT-60-4B) surpassing the much larger Aya-101-13B and NLLB-54B models by a substantial margin. We release LMT in four sizes (0.6B/1.7B/4B/8B) to catalyze future research and provide strong baselines for inclusive, scalable, and high-quality MMT \footnote{\href{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}{https://github.com/NiuTrans/LMT}}.

TL;DR: The paper outlines a system called BLEU Monday for English-to-Indic text-only multimodal translation tasks, using error correction and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to improve translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance translation accuracy for multiple English-to-Indic language pairs by addressing quality issues in the training data and leveraging multimodal approaches.

Method: A judge-corrector pipeline identifies and corrects training data errors using multimodal classifiers and specialized translation models, followed by fine-tuning using LoRA on corrected datasets.

Result: The system achieved consistent BLEU score improvements, such as +1.30 for English-Bengali and +0.60 for English-Odia, showcasing enhanced translation quality.

Conclusion: The methodology demonstrates that correcting training data errors and fine-tuning on refined datasets systematically benefits translation performance across multiple language pairs.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our system under the team name BLEU Monday for the English-to-Indic Multimodal Translation Task at WAT 2025. We participate in the text-only translation tasks for English-Hindi, English-Bengali, English-Malayalam, and English-Odia language pairs. We present a two-stage approach that addresses quality issues in the training data through automated error detection and correction, followed by parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.
  Our methodology introduces a vision-augmented judge-corrector pipeline that leverages multimodal language models to systematically identify and correct translation errors in the training data. The judge component classifies translations into three categories: correct, visually ambiguous (requiring image context), or mistranslated (poor translation quality). Identified errors are routed to specialized correctors: GPT-4o-mini regenerates captions requiring visual disambiguation, while IndicTrans2 retranslates cases with pure translation quality issues. This automated pipeline processes 28,928 training examples across four languages, correcting an average of 17.1% of captions per language.
  We then apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the IndicTrans2 en-indic 200M distilled model on both original and corrected datasets. Training on corrected data yields consistent improvements, with BLEU score gains of +1.30 for English-Bengali on the evaluation set (42.00 -> 43.30) and +0.70 on the challenge set (44.90 -> 45.60), +0.60 for English-Odia on the evaluation set (41.00 -> 41.60), and +0.10 for English-Hindi on the challenge set (53.90 -> 54.00).

TL;DR: The study analyzed speech data and depressive symptoms from 586 participants across different countries, seeking interpretable markers of depression. Results showed limited predictive power due to sample and methodological constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of speech as a tool for objective assessment and earlier detection of major depressive disorder symptoms amid limited interpretability in prior machine learning studies.

Method: Analyzed longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from participants using linear mixed-effects modelling and machine learning regression models to identify and predict lexical markers of depression severity.

Result: Lexical markers were linked to depression severity in English (e.g., lexical diversity) and some in Dutch, but no associations in Spanish data. Predictive accuracy was near chance due to linguistic and methodological challenges.

Conclusion: Further studies with larger samples, improved protocols, and better multilingual NLP tools are required to evaluate lexical markers' value in clinical depression research.

Abstract: Background: Captured between clinical appointments using mobile devices, spoken language has potential for objective, more regular assessment of symptom severity and earlier detection of relapse in major depressive disorder. However, research to date has largely been in non-clinical cross-sectional samples of written language using complex machine learning (ML) approaches with limited interpretability.
  Methods: We describe an initial exploratory analysis of longitudinal speech data and PHQ-8 assessments from 5,836 recordings of 586 participants in the UK, Netherlands, and Spain, collected in the RADAR-MDD study. We sought to identify interpretable lexical features associated with MDD symptom severity with linear mixed-effects modelling. Interpretable features and high-dimensional vector embeddings were also used to test the prediction performance of four regressor ML models.
  Results: In English data, MDD symptom severity was associated with 7 features including lexical diversity measures and absolutist language. In Dutch, associations were observed with words per sentence and positive word frequency; no associations were observed in recordings collected in Spain. The predictive power of lexical features and vector embeddings was near chance level across all languages.
  Limitations: Smaller samples in non-English speech and methodological choices, such as the elicitation prompt, may have also limited the effect sizes observable. A lack of NLP tools in languages other than English restricted our feature choice.
  Conclusion: To understand the value of lexical markers in clinical research and practice, further research is needed in larger samples across several languages using improved protocols, and ML models that account for within- and between-individual variations in language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in training data/methodologies of existing models by releasing an open-source, high-performance multilingual embedding model.

Method: The model combines 16.1M query-document pairs (7.7M from public datasets and 8.4M synthetic examples) and utilizes detailed ablation studies on core design choices and model improvements.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art results in multilingual and embedding tasks (retrieval, classification, STS), especially in low-resource and cross-lingual setups.

Conclusion: This model provides high performance, multilingual support, and user-driven flexibility, serving as a universal text embedding solution.

Abstract: We introduce llama-embed-nemotron-8b, an open-weights text embedding model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Multilingual Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) leaderboard as of October 21, 2025. While recent models show strong performance, their training data or methodologies are often not fully disclosed. We aim to address this by developing a fully open-source model, publicly releasing its weights and detailed ablation studies, and planning to share the curated training datasets. Our model demonstrates superior performance across all major embedding tasks -- including retrieval, classification and semantic textual similarity (STS) -- and excels in challenging multilingual scenarios, such as low-resource languages and cross-lingual setups. This state-of-the-art performance is driven by a novel data mix of 16.1 million query-document pairs, split between 7.7 million samples from public datasets and 8.4 million synthetically generated examples from various open-weight LLMs. One of our key contributions is a detailed ablation study analyzing core design choices, including a comparison of contrastive loss implementations, an evaluation of synthetic data generation (SDG) strategies, and the impact of model merging. The llama-embed-nemotron-8b is an instruction-aware model, supporting user-defined instructions to enhance performance for specific use-cases. This combination of top-tier performance, broad applicability, and user-driven flexibility enables it to serve as a universal text embedding solution.

TL;DR: This study compares various models, including LLMs and transformers like Distil-RoBERTa, for mental health detection, showcasing their effectiveness and the benefits of synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health disorders affect a large portion of the global population, and detecting such conditions from text is difficult due to the subtlety of symptom expression.

Method: The paper evaluates classical machine learning, LLMs, and transformer-based architectures using the DAIC-WOZ dataset for classification tasks related to anxiety, depression, and stress. Synthetic data generation was also implemented to address class imbalance.

Result: Distil-RoBERTa achieved the best results in anxiety detection (F1: 0.883), XLNet excelled for depression detection (F1 up to 0.891), and synthetic data for stress detection with zero-shot showed an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models combined with synthetic data demonstrate strong performance for automated mental health assessment but require calibration to balance precision and recall.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over one-fifth of adults globally, yet detecting such conditions from text remains challenging due to the subtle and varied nature of symptom expression. This study evaluates multiple approaches for mental health detection, comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama and GPT with classical machine learning and transformer-based architectures including BERT, XLNet, and Distil-RoBERTa. Using the DAIC-WOZ dataset of clinical interviews, we fine-tuned models for anxiety, depression, and stress classification and applied synthetic data generation to mitigate class imbalance. Results show that Distil-RoBERTa achieved the highest F1 score (0.883) for GAD-2, while XLNet outperformed others on PHQ tasks (F1 up to 0.891). For stress detection, a zero-shot synthetic approach (SD+Zero-Shot-Basic) reached an F1 of 0.884 and ROC AUC of 0.886. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models and highlight the value of synthetic data in improving recall and generalization. However, careful calibration is required to prevent precision loss. Overall, this work emphasizes the potential of combining advanced language models and data augmentation to enhance automated mental health assessment from text.

TL;DR: Examines feature attribution methods in machine learning, showcasing how combining models improves recall of contributing features significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in feature attribution methods that only provide minimal evidence, particularly in applications requiring complete evidence like compliance.

Method: Performed case study on medical dataset with human-annotated evidence, used dynamic ensembles among models to aggregate evidence and assess metrics.

Result: Improved evidence recall from ~0.60 for single models to ~0.86 using ensemble approaches.

Conclusion: Aggregating feature evidence from multiple models enhances recall and provides more complete evidence for applications like compliance and cataloging.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods typically provide minimal sufficient evidence justifying a model decision. However, in many applications this is inadequate. For compliance and cataloging, the full set of contributing features must be identified - complete evidence. We perform a case study on a medical dataset which contains human-annotated complete evidence. We show that individual models typically recover only subsets of complete evidence and that aggregating evidence from several models improves evidence recall from $\sim$0.60 (single best model) to $\sim$0.86 (ensemble). We analyze the recall-precision trade-off, the role of training with evidence, dynamic ensembles with certainty thresholds, and discuss implications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Supervised Rational Attention (SRA) to improve interpretability and fairness in hate speech detection by aligning model attention with human rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address the opaque nature of deep learning models and the associated challenges in deploying ethical and fair hate speech detection systems.

Method: The SRA framework integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers by jointly optimizing classification loss and alignment loss (minimizing discrepancy between attention weights and human rationales).

Result: SRA demonstrates a 2.4x improvement in explainability, offers token-level explanations that are more human-aligned, and achieves competitive fairness, particularly in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups.

Conclusion: Incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms enhances interpretability and faithfulness of hate speech detection systems without compromising their fairness.

Abstract: The opaque nature of deep learning models presents significant challenges for the ethical deployment of hate speech detection systems. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Rational Attention (SRA), a framework that explicitly aligns model attention with human rationales, improving both interpretability and fairness in hate speech classification. SRA integrates a supervised attention mechanism into transformer-based classifiers, optimizing a joint objective that combines standard classification loss with an alignment loss term that minimizes the discrepancy between attention weights and human-annotated rationales. We evaluated SRA on hate speech benchmarks in English (HateXplain) and Portuguese (HateBRXplain) with rationale annotations. Empirically, SRA achieves 2.4x better explainability compared to current baselines, and produces token-level explanations that are more faithful and human-aligned. In terms of fairness, SRA achieves competitive fairness across all measures, with second-best performance in detecting toxic posts targeting identity groups, while maintaining comparable results on other metrics. These findings demonstrate that incorporating human rationales into attention mechanisms can enhance interpretability and faithfulness without compromising fairness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a new metric to select high-quality data for better instruction tuning of large language models. Their approach using MIWV allows for better performance by using only a very small subset of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve instruction tuning for large language models by selecting the most beneficial high-quality data, addressing the inefficiencies of using full-scale datasets and focusing on data effectiveness rather than just quality scoring.

Method: The authors propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV), a metric that identifies the importance of instruction data based on discrepancies in model responses during in-context learning. They use MIWV to select the top 1% of the best-performing data for instruction tuning.

Result: The experiments show that using the MIWV-selected top 1% of data outperforms training on a full-scale dataset in terms of instruction tuning efficiency and model performance.

Conclusion: MIWV offers a robust data selection method that enhances instruction tuning for large language models, focusing on data that maximally improves model capabilities and presenting a promising alternative to traditional quality-based data scoring methods.

Abstract: Instruction tuning plays a critical role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Its success depends not only on the quality of the instruction data but also on the inherent capabilities of the LLM itself. Some studies suggest that even a small amount of high-quality data can achieve instruction fine-tuning results that are on par with, or even exceed, those from using a full-scale dataset. However, rather than focusing solely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there is a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the performance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose the Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the importance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV metric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using In-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for enhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that selecting only the top 1\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training on the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing research that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering strong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection, introducing a new dataset and two novel detection models that achieve notable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to fill the gap in emotion detection research for Bengali, a low-resource language, by providing a standardized dataset and effective models.

Method: The paper introduces a new annotated dataset and two automatic emotion detection models: a hybrid CRNN model (EmoBangHybrid) and an AdaBoost-BERT ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). It also evaluates baseline models and explores zero-shot and few-shot language models.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate high accuracies of 92.86% for EmoBangHybrid and 93.69% for EmoBangEnsemble, surpassing existing approaches.

Conclusion: The findings establish strong baselines for Bengali emotion detection and pave the way for advancing research in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Emotion detection from text seeks to identify an individual's emotional or mental state - positive, negative, or neutral - based on linguistic cues. While significant progress has been made for English and other high-resource languages, Bengali remains underexplored despite being the world's fourth most spoken language. The lack of large, standardized datasets classifies Bengali as a low-resource language for emotion detection. Existing studies mainly employ classical machine learning models with traditional feature engineering, yielding limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a new Bengali emotion dataset annotated across eight emotion categories and propose two models for automatic emotion detection: (i) a hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model (EmoBangHybrid) and (ii) an AdaBoost-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ensemble model (EmoBangEnsemble). Additionally, we evaluate six baseline models with five feature engineering techniques and assess zero-shot and few-shot large language models (LLMs) on the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark for Bengali emotion detection. Experimental results show that EmoBangH and EmoBangE achieve accuracies of 92.86% and 93.69%, respectively, outperforming existing methods and establishing strong baselines for future research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new Arabic multimodal dataset called Wasm, created using a specialized pipeline to process the Common Crawl dataset and preserve document structure in markdown format.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets for Arabic that retain document structure, as this limitation has hindered advancements in Arabic large language and multimodal models.

Method: The authors developed the Wasm pipeline to process the Common Crawl dataset, focusing on preserving structural integrity while supporting both text-only and multimodal pre-training scenarios.

Result: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the Wasm pipeline by providing a comparative analysis with other dataset processing approaches and releasing a representative dataset dump.

Conclusion: By creating Wasm, the authors have significantly contributed to advancing Arabic multimodal research and enabled future developments by releasing their pipeline and dataset publicly.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) depends heavily on the quality and scale of their pre-training datasets. Recent research shows that large multimodal models trained on natural documents where images and text are interleaved outperform those trained only on image-text pairs across a wide range of benchmarks, leveraging advanced pre- trained models to enforce semantic alignment, image-sequence consistency, and textual coherence. For Arabic, however, the lack of high-quality multimodal datasets that preserve document structure has limited progress. In this paper, we present our pipeline Wasm for processing the Common Crawl dataset to create a new Arabic multimodal dataset that uniquely provides markdown output. Unlike existing Arabic corpora that focus solely on text extraction, our approach preserves the structural integrity of web content while maintaining flexibility for both text-only and multimodal pre-training scenarios. We provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of our data processing pipeline against those used for major existing datasets, highlighting the convergences in filtering strategies and justifying our specific design choices. To support future research, we publicly release a representative dataset dump along with the multimodal processing pipeline for Arabic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores the robustness of collaborative LLM agents under adversarial math inputs, finding improved accuracy with collaboration but persistent vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether collaborative LLM agents exhibit increased robustness to adversarial inputs compared to a single LLM, particularly in mathematical question answering.

Method: Researchers used adversarially perturbed math questions with various noise types, tested six open-source models, and measured accuracy under different agent configurations using a sampling-and-voting mechanism.

Result: Collaboration among agents improves mathematical accuracy, showing the largest improvements with up to five agents. However, adversarial vulnerabilities persist, especially against human-like typos.

Conclusion: While collaboration enhances accuracy in math tasks, it does not eliminate vulnerabilities to adversarial inputs, particularly human-like typos.

Abstract: When LLM agents work together, they seem to be more powerful than a single LLM in mathematical question answering. However, are they also more robust to adversarial inputs? We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents. However, the adversarial robustness gap persists regardless of the agent count.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'EBM-CoT,' a novel framework designed to improve reasoning accuracy and consistency in large language models (LLMs) by refining their latent thought processes using an energy-based model (EBM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in LLMs often suffer from error propagation and limited consistency, while implicit reasoning lacks mechanisms for coherence among reasoning steps. A solution is needed to address these issues.

Method: Introduce EBM-CoT, a calibration framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories in LLMs through energy-based modeling, dynamically pushing reasoning paths toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space.

Result: Through extensive experiments across various benchmarks (mathematical, commonsense, symbolic reasoning), the EBM-CoT framework demonstrated improved accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in multi-step reasoning without modifying the base language model.

Conclusion: EBM-CoT provides a robust mechanism for refining reasoning processes in LLMs, addressing limitations of both explicit and implicit CoT techniques, and significantly enhances consistent performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities through \emph{Chain-of-Thought} (CoT) prompting, which enables step-by-step intermediate reasoning. However, explicit CoT methods rely on discrete token-level reasoning processes that are prone to error propagation and limited by vocabulary expressiveness, often resulting in rigid and inconsistent reasoning trajectories. Recent research has explored implicit or continuous reasoning in latent spaces, allowing models to perform internal reasoning before generating explicit output. Although such approaches alleviate some limitations of discrete CoT, they generally lack explicit mechanisms to enforce consistency among reasoning steps, leading to divergent reasoning paths and unstable outcomes. To address this issue, we propose EBM-CoT, an Energy-Based Chain-of-Thought Calibration framework that refines latent thought representations through an energy-based model (EBM). Our method dynamically adjusts latent reasoning trajectories toward lower-energy, high-consistency regions in the embedding space, improving both reasoning accuracy and consistency without modifying the base language model. Extensive experiments across mathematical, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances the consistency and efficiency of multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA on the Go (LoGo) is a training-free framework for dynamically merging adapters at the instance level, improving applicability across diverse domains without requiring labeled data or task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LoRA adapters face limitations when applied to diverse and unpredictable domains, necessitating task-specific training or labeled data, which can be expensive.

Method: LoGo dynamically selects and merges LoRA adapters during inference by analyzing signals from a single forward pass, eliminating the need for additional training or labeled data.

Result: LoGo demonstrated improved performance on several NLP benchmarks and datasets, outperforming some training-based methods by up to 3.6% and maintaining competitive results on others.

Conclusion: LoGo offers a practical, efficient alternative to task-specific training, enhancing the adaptability and scalability of LoRA adapters for real-world applications.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning large language models.However, conventional LoRA adapters are typically trained for a single task, limiting their applicability in real-world settings where inputs may span diverse and unpredictable domains. At inference time, existing approaches combine multiple LoRAs for improving performance on diverse tasks, while usually requiring labeled data or additional task-specific training, which is expensive at scale. In this work, we introduce LoRA on the Go (LoGo), a training-free framework that dynamically selects and merges adapters at the instance level without any additional requirements. LoGo leverages signals extracted from a single forward pass through LoRA adapters, to identify the most relevant adapters and determine their contributions on-the-fly. Across 5 NLP benchmarks, 27 datasets, and 3 model families, LoGo outperforms training-based baselines on some tasks upto a margin of 3.6% while remaining competitive on other tasks and maintaining inference throughput, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality.

Conclusion: This work offers benchmarks, methods, and tools encouraging further exploration and innovation in TCM-related AI applications through community collaboration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modern medicine, yet their application in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains severely limited by the absence of standardized benchmarks and the scarcity of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we introduce TCM-Eval, the first dynamic and extensible benchmark for TCM, meticulously curated from national medical licensing examinations and validated by TCM experts. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale training corpus and propose Self-Iterative Chain-of-Thought Enhancement (SI-CoTE) to autonomously enrich question-answer pairs with validated reasoning chains through rejection sampling, establishing a virtuous cycle of data and model co-evolution. Using this enriched training data, we develop ZhiMingTang (ZMT), a state-of-the-art LLM specifically designed for TCM, which significantly exceeds the passing threshold for human practitioners. To encourage future research and development, we release a public leaderboard, fostering community engagement and continuous improvement.

### [163] [Categorical Emotions or Appraisals - Which Emotion Model Explains Argument Convincingness Better?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07162)
*Lynn Greschner,Meike Bauer,Sabine Weber,Roman Klinger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of subjective emotions and appraisals in assessing the convincingness of arguments, demonstrating appraisals are more effective than categorical emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determine the suitability of appraisal theories for understanding the subjective emotions evoked by arguments and their impact on convincingness.

Method: Conducted zero-shot prompting experiments using the ContArgA corpus to assess the importance of emotions and appraisals in predicting argument convincingness.

Result: Findings indicate appraisals improve convincingness prediction more effectively compared to categorical emotion information.

Conclusion: Appraisals prove advantageous for interpreting argumentative convincingness, offering theoretical and practical benefits in computational argumentation.

Abstract: The convincingness of an argument does not only depend on its structure (logos), the person who makes the argument (ethos), but also on the emotion that it causes in the recipient (pathos). While the overall intensity and categorical values of emotions in arguments have received considerable attention in the research community, we argue that the emotion an argument evokes in a recipient is subjective. It depends on the recipient's goals, standards, prior knowledge, and stance. Appraisal theories lend themselves as a link between the subjective cognitive assessment of events and emotions. They have been used in event-centric emotion analysis, but their suitability for assessing argument convincingness remains unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate whether appraisal theories are suitable for emotion analysis in arguments by considering subjective cognitive evaluations of the importance and impact of an argument on its receiver. Based on the annotations in the recently published ContArgA corpus, we perform zero-shot prompting experiments to evaluate the importance of gold-annotated and predicted emotions and appraisals for the assessment of the subjective convincingness labels. We find that, while categorical emotion information does improve convincingness prediction, the improvement is more pronounced with appraisals. This work presents the first systematic comparison between emotion models for convincingness prediction, demonstrating the advantage of appraisals, providing insights for theoretical and practical applications in computational argumentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current recommendation systems, particularly enhancing personalization efficiency and adapting across tasks with minimal data inputs.

Method: AdaRec uses a few-shot learning paradigm with narrative profiling to process user interactions. It integrates horizontal behavioral alignment with vertical causal attribution for recommendation patterns.

Result: AdaRec exhibits up to 8% improvement in few-shot settings and 19% in zero-shot scenarios compared to baselines. Lightweight fine-tuning matches fully tuned models' performance.

Conclusion: AdaRec proves effective for adaptive personalized recommendations, showcasing efficiency and scalability with minimal data inputs.

Abstract: We propose AdaRec, a few-shot in-context learning framework that leverages large language models for an adaptive personalized recommendation. AdaRec introduces narrative profiling, transforming user-item interactions into natural language representations to enable unified task handling and enhance human readability. Centered on a bivariate reasoning paradigm, AdaRec employs a dual-channel architecture that integrates horizontal behavioral alignment, discovering peer-driven patterns, with vertical causal attribution, highlighting decisive factors behind user preferences. Unlike existing LLM-based approaches, AdaRec eliminates manual feature engineering through semantic representations and supports rapid cross-task adaptation with minimal supervision. Experiments on real ecommerce datasets demonstrate that AdaRec outperforms both machine learning models and LLM-based baselines by up to eight percent in few-shot settings. In zero-shot scenarios, it achieves up to a nineteen percent improvement over expert-crafted profiling, showing effectiveness for long-tail personalization with minimal interaction data. Furthermore, lightweight fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by AdaRec matches the performance of fully fine-tuned models, highlighting its efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks.

### [165] [EMODIS: A Benchmark for Context-Dependent Emoji Disambiguation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07193)
*Jiacheng Huang,Ning Yu,Xiaoyin Yi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EMODIS, a benchmark for testing large language models' (LLMs) ability to interpret ambiguous emojis in varied contexts, showcasing their limitations compared to human reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored ability of LLMs to resolve context-dependent ambiguities, particularly in real-world communication involving emojis.

Method: EMODIS was created as a benchmark comprising ambiguous emoji-containing sentences paired with divergent textual contexts that require models to use contextual reasoning. The authors evaluated several LLMs based on this benchmark.

Result: The evaluation shows that even strong LLMs often fail to differentiate meanings in cases where contextual cues are subtle. Furthermore, systematic biases and limited pragmatic sensitivity were observed in these models.

Conclusion: EMODIS exposes the gap in semantic reasoning between LLMs and humans and serves as a testbed for improving contextual disambiguation in language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world communication settings, yet their ability to resolve context-dependent ambiguity remains underexplored. In this work, we present EMODIS, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capacity to interpret ambiguous emoji expressions under minimal but contrastive textual contexts. Each instance in EMODIS comprises an ambiguous sentence containing an emoji, two distinct disambiguating contexts that lead to divergent interpretations, and a specific question that requires contextual reasoning. We evaluate both open-source and API-based LLMs, and find that even the strongest models frequently fail to distinguish meanings when only subtle contextual cues are present. Further analysis reveals systematic biases toward dominant interpretations and limited sensitivity to pragmatic contrast. EMODIS provides a rigorous testbed for assessing contextual disambiguation, and highlights the gap in semantic reasoning between humans and LLMs.

*Viet-Thanh Pham,Minghan Wang,Hao-Han Liao,Thuy-Trang Vu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransGraph, a framework that uses structured discourse graphs for document-level machine translation, achieving higher quality translations with reduced token overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving document-level translation by addressing challenges like long-range dependency capture and maintaining discourse coherence.

Method: TransGraph employs structured discourse graphs to model inter-chunk relationships and selectively conditions translations on relevant graph neighborhoods.

Result: Across three benchmarks, TransGraph exceeds baseline performance in translation quality and terminology consistency across six languages and diverse domains.

Conclusion: TransGraph offers a viable alternative to conventional approaches, improving translation quality efficiently while minimizing computational demands.

Abstract: Adapting large language models to full document translation remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing long-range dependencies and preserving discourse coherence throughout extended texts. While recent agentic machine translation systems mitigate context window constraints through multi-agent orchestration and persistent memory, they require substantial computational resources and are sensitive to memory retrieval strategies. We introduce TransGraph, a discourse-guided framework that explicitly models inter-chunk relationships through structured discourse graphs and selectively conditions each translation segment on relevant graph neighbourhoods rather than relying on sequential or exhaustive context. Across three document-level MT benchmarks spanning six languages and diverse domains, TransGraph consistently surpasses strong baselines in translation quality and terminology consistency while incurring significantly lower token overhead.

### [167] [Who Is the Story About? Protagonist Entity Recognition in News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07296)
*Jorge Gabín,M. Eduardo Ares,Javier Parapar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task to identify key organizations in news narratives, evaluates it with expert annotations and LLMs, and showcases its scalability and importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NER fails to distinguish entities driving the narrative, limiting tasks requiring narrative focus or event salience.

Method: The authors establish PER using expert-annotated corpora and large language models (LLMs), utilizing NER-guided prompting for scalable and automated labeling.

Result: Findings confirm PER's feasibility as an extension of narrative information extraction, with guided LLMs approximating human narrative importance judgments.

Conclusion: PER adds depth to narrative information extraction, proving practical and scalable with the aid of guided LLMs.

Abstract: News articles often reference numerous organizations, but traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) treats all mentions equally, obscuring which entities genuinely drive the narrative. This limits downstream tasks that rely on understanding event salience, influence, or narrative focus. We introduce Protagonist Entity Recognition (PER), a task that identifies the organizations that anchor a news story and shape its main developments. To validate PER, we compare he predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) against annotations from four expert annotators over a gold corpus, establishing both inter-annotator consistency and human-LLM agreement. Leveraging these findings, we use state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically label large-scale news collections through NER-guided prompting, generating scalable, high-quality supervision. We then evaluate whether other LLMs, given reduced context and without explicit candidate guidance, can still infer the correct protagonists. Our results demonstrate that PER is a feasible and meaningful extension to narrative-centered information extraction, and that guided LLMs can approximate human judgments of narrative importance at scale.

Motivation: The paper aims to tackle Bangla hate speech, a social issue and linguistically complex problem, through advanced computational methods.

Method: An ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2) was used for subtasks 1A and 1B. For subtask 1C, multitask variants were aggregated via weighted voting ensembles.

Result: The proposed systems achieved high micro-f1 scores: 72.75% (1A), 72.69% (1B), and 72.62% (1C), ranking 9th, 10th, and 7th on the shared leaderboard.

Conclusion: Transformer ensembles and multitask frameworks show promise for improving hate speech detection in Bangla, with publicly released experimental scripts aiding community development.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of Bangla hate speech identification, a socially impactful yet linguistically challenging task. As part of the "Bangla Multi-task Hate Speech Identification" shared task at the BLP Workshop, IJCNLP-AACL 2025, our team "Retriv" participated in all three subtasks: (1A) hate type classification, (1B) target group identification, and (1C) joint detection of type, severity, and target. For subtasks 1A and 1B, we employed a soft-voting ensemble of transformer models (BanglaBERT, MuRIL, IndicBERTv2). For subtask 1C, we trained three multitask variants and aggregated their predictions through a weighted voting ensemble. Our systems achieved micro-f1 scores of 72.75% (1A) and 72.69% (1B), and a weighted micro-f1 score of 72.62% (1C). On the shared task leaderboard, these corresponded to 9th, 10th, and 7th positions, respectively. These results highlight the promise of transformer ensembles and weighted multitask frameworks for advancing Bangla hate speech detection in low-resource contexts. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

*Tuan-Dung Le,Shohreh Haddadan,Thanh Q. Thieu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents ACE-ICD, a method to improve automatic ICD coding using large language models and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods improve model understanding of code hierarchies but fail to consider medical acronyms in clinical notes.

Method: A novel data augmentation technique expands medical acronyms using large language models, paired with consistency training to regularize predictions.

Result: ACE-ICD achieves state-of-the-art results on the MIMIC-III dataset for various coding scenarios.

Conclusion: Leveraging large language models for acronym expansion and consistency training enhances ICD coding accuracy significantly.

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding, the task of assigning disease and procedure codes to electronic medical records, is crucial for clinical documentation and billing. While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and full-code assignments. Our code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RL with Adaptive Verifiable Environments (RLVE) and demonstrates its effectiveness in improving language models' reasoning performance, using a large suite of dynamic, procedurally-generated, verifiable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of static data distributions causing vanishing learning signals in reinforcement learning, which hinders effective language model training.

Method: Introduced RLVE, an approach using adaptive verifiable environments that dynamically adjust problem difficulty and created RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments for training. Benchmarks and joint training across these environments were performed to assess effectiveness.

Result: RLVE-Gym showed comprehensive improvement in reasoning capabilities of a 1.5B parameter language model, with a 3.37% average absolute improvement across six benchmarks compared to significantly less improvement (0.49%) with more compute-intensive traditional methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic and adaptive verifiable environments are effective at improving reasoning in language models. RLVE demonstrates scalable and efficient learning techniques, surpassing traditional approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Adaptive Verifiable Environments (RLVE), an approach using verifiable environments that procedurally generate problems and provide algorithmically verifiable rewards, to scale up RL for language models (LMs). RLVE enables each verifiable environment to dynamically adapt its problem difficulty distribution to the policy model's capabilities as training progresses. In contrast, static data distributions often lead to vanishing learning signals when problems are either too easy or too hard for the policy. To implement RLVE, we create RLVE-Gym, a large-scale suite of 400 verifiable environments carefully developed through manual environment engineering. Using RLVE-Gym, we show that environment scaling, i.e., expanding the collection of training environments, consistently improves generalizable reasoning capabilities. RLVE with joint training across all 400 environments in RLVE-Gym yields a 3.37% absolute average improvement across six reasoning benchmarks, starting from one of the strongest 1.5B reasoning LMs. By comparison, continuing this LM's original RL training yields only a 0.49% average absolute gain despite using over 3x more compute. We release our code publicly.

*Shaowen Wang,Yiqi Dong,Ruinian Chang,Tansheng Zhu,Yuebo Sun,Kaifeng Lyu,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) caused by spurious correlations in training data and highlights their persistent and undetectable nature using current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a previously overlooked type of hallucination in LLMs caused by spurious correlations in the training data, which current methods fail to detect or mitigate.

Method: The authors use systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on advanced LLMs to demonstrate the shortcomings of current hallucination detection methods. They also provide theoretical analysis of these biases.

Result: The study finds that hallucinations caused by spurious correlations are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, resist detection and fine-tuning, and evade current detection techniques.

Conclusion: New methods need to be developed to specifically target hallucinations induced by spurious correlations, as existing solutions are fundamentally inadequate for this issue.

Abstract: Despite substantial advances, large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet incorrect responses. In this paper, we highlight a critical yet previously underexplored class of hallucinations driven by spurious correlations -- superficial but statistically prominent associations between features (e.g., surnames) and attributes (e.g., nationality) present in the training data. We demonstrate that these spurious correlations induce hallucinations that are confidently generated, immune to model scaling, evade current detection methods, and persist even after refusal fine-tuning. Through systematically controlled synthetic experiments and empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs (including GPT-5), we show that existing hallucination detection methods, such as confidence-based filtering and inner-state probing, fundamentally fail in the presence of spurious correlations. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates why these statistical biases intrinsically undermine confidence-based detection techniques. Our findings thus emphasize the urgent need for new approaches explicitly designed to address hallucinations caused by spurious correlations.

Abstract: While LLMs have shown great success in financial tasks like stock prediction and question answering, their application in fully automating Equity Research Report generation remains uncharted territory. In this paper, we formulate the Equity Research Report (ERR) Generation task for the first time. To address the data scarcity and the evaluation metrics absence, we present an open-source evaluation benchmark for ERR generation - FinRpt. We frame a Dataset Construction Pipeline that integrates 7 financial data types and produces a high-quality ERR dataset automatically, which could be used for model training and evaluation. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system including 11 metrics to assess the generated ERRs. Moreover, we propose a multi-agent framework specifically tailored to address this task, named FinRpt-Gen, and train several LLM-based agents on the proposed datasets using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results indicate the data quality and metrics effectiveness of the benchmark FinRpt and the strong performance of FinRpt-Gen, showcasing their potential to drive innovation in the ERR generation field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents 'NTK-Selector,' a method to efficiently select auxiliary general-domain data for improving large language models' performance in low-resource domains using a neural tangent kernels-based framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited in-domain data and overfitting in low-resource domains and strategically leverage vast general-domain data for domain-specific enhancement.

Method: The paper introduces NTK-Selector, which uses neural tangent kernels to select valuable auxiliary data. It overcomes computational and theoretical limitations by empirically demonstrating NTK stability during LoRA fine-tuning and using a Jacobian-free approximation technique.

Result: Experiments in four domains showed that NTK-Selector dramatically improves model performance, augmenting low-resource data with carefully chosen auxiliary samples, resulting in gains as high as 10.9x over domain-only fine-tuning results.

Conclusion: NTK-Selector is an effective and efficient approach to utilize general-domain data to enhance the performance of language models in low-resource domains, significantly outperforming traditional fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across widespread tasks, yet their application in low-resource domains remains a significant challenge due to data scarcity and the high risk of overfitting. While in-domain data is limited, there exist vast amounts of similar general-domain data, and our initial findings reveal that they could potentially serve as auxiliary supervision for domain enhancement. This observation leads us to our central research question: \textbf{\textit{how to effectively select the most valuable auxiliary data to maximize domain-specific performance}}, particularly when traditional methods are inapplicable due to a lack of large in-domain data pools or validation sets. To address this, we propose \textbf{NTK-Selector}, a principled and efficient framework for selecting general-domain auxiliary data to enhance domain-specific performance via neural tangent kernels (NTK). Our method tackles two challenges of directly applying NTK to LLMs, theoretical assumptions and prohibitive computational cost, by empirically demonstrating a stable NTK-like behavior in LLMs during LoRA fine-tuning and proposing a Jacobian-free approximation method. Extensive experiments across four low-resource domains (medical, financial, legal, and psychological) demonstrate that NTK-Selector consistently improves downstream performance. Specifically, fine-tuning on 1,000 in-domain samples alone only yielded +0.8 points for Llama3-8B-Instruct and +0.9 points for Qwen3-8B. In contrast, enriching with 9,000 auxiliary samples selected by NTK-Selector led to substantial \textbf{gains of +8.7 and +5.1 points}, which corresponds to a \textbf{10.9x and 5.7x improvement} over the domain-only setting.

Motivation: To overcome the lack of resources for code generation in low-resource languages like Bangla and provide better benchmarks for evaluation.

Method: The method combines instruction prompting with test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model, iteratively testing and improving the generated code through evaluation passes.

Result: The team achieved 2nd place in the IJCNLP workshop shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934, showcasing effectiveness in Bangla instruction understanding and Python code generation.

Conclusion: Targeted approaches are essential for improving code generation in low-resource languages, and the shared experimental scripts promote community development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced the automated generation of code from natural language prompts. However, low-resource languages (LRLs) like Bangla remain underrepresented due to the limited availability of instruction-to-code datasets and evaluation benchmarks. To address this, the BLP Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 introduced a shared task on "Code Generation in Bangla". In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team "Retriv" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934. The analysis highlights challenges in Bangla instruction understanding and Python code generation, emphasizing the need for targeted methods in LRLs. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational cost and enhance performance of language models by decoupling train-time compute/parameter counts from test-time compute through depth-recurrent designs.

Method: A curriculum of recurrences is employed to gradually increase model depth during training, applied to convert pretrained non-recurrent models into recurrent ones.

Result: Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate improved performance of recurrent models compared to non-recurrent models with the same computational budget.

Conclusion: Depth-recurrent conversion of pretrained language models is a practical approach to reducing computational costs while preserving or enhancing performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in depth-recurrent language models show that recurrence can decouple train-time compute and parameter count from test-time compute. In this work, we study how to convert existing pretrained non-recurrent language models into depth-recurrent models. We find that using a curriculum of recurrences to increase the effective depth of the model over the course of training preserves performance while reducing total computational cost. In our experiments, on mathematics, we observe that converting pretrained models to recurrent ones results in better performance at a given compute budget than simply post-training the original non-recurrent language model.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a voice-directed platform that aids in da Vinci robotic surgery, using a hierarchical framework of agents powered by Large Language Models to execute complex tasks and manage patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgeons face difficulty in accessing and manipulating multi-modal patient data during robotic surgeries without interrupting the procedure.

Method: The platform uses a hierarchical multi-agent framework, with LLM-based agents for task execution and a novel evaluation metric to test command accuracy.

Result: The system achieves high accuracy and success rates with robust support for diverse voice commands, even handling speech recognition errors effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed platform shows strong capability to enhance minimally invasive robotic surgeries, making the process more efficient and thorough.

Abstract: In da Vinci robotic surgery, surgeons' hands and eyes are fully engaged in the procedure, making it difficult to access and manipulate multimodal patient data without interruption. We propose a voice-directed Surgical Agent Orchestrator Platform (SAOP) built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework, consisting of an orchestration agent and three task-specific agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLM-based agents autonomously plan, refine, validate, and reason to map voice commands into specific tasks such as retrieving clinical information, manipulating CT scans, or navigating 3D anatomical models on the surgical video. We also introduce a Multi-level Orchestration Evaluation Metric (MOEM) to comprehensively assess the performance and robustness from command-level and category-level perspectives. The SAOP achieves high accuracy and success rates across 240 voice commands, while LLM-based agents improve robustness against speech recognition errors and diverse or ambiguous free-form commands, demonstrating strong potential to support minimally invasive da Vinci robotic surgery.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing responsiveness and sophistication in conversational voice agents by introducing a lightweight on-device model (ConvFill) for generating immediate responses while using a backend model for deeper reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create conversational agents that are both responsive and knowledgeable, overcoming the challenge of cloud-based models' latency and on-device models' lack of sophistication.

Method: The authors propose "conversational infill," where a lightweight on-device model (ConvFill) generates immediate responses while incorporating knowledge from a backend LLM. ConvFill, with 360M parameters, is trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations.

Result: ConvFill shows a 36-42% accuracy improvement over standalone small models of the same size and maintains sub-200ms response latencies when tested with various backend models.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of building on-device conversational agents capable of providing both prompt and contextually rich responses, addressing a key industry challenge.

Abstract: Deploying conversational voice agents with large language models faces a critical challenge: cloud-based foundation models provide deep reasoning and domain knowledge but introduce latency that disrupts natural conversation, while on-device models respond immediately but lack sophistication. We propose conversational infill, a task where a lightweight on-device model generates contextually appropriate dialogue while seamlessly incorporating streaming knowledge from a powerful backend model. This approach decouples response latency from model capability, enabling systems that feel responsive while accessing the full power of large-scale models. We present ConvFill, a 360M parameter model trained on synthetic multi-domain conversations. Evaluation across multiple backend models shows that conversational infill can be successfully learned, with ConvFill achieving accuracy improvements of 36-42% over standalone small models of the same size while consistently retaining sub-200ms response latencies. Our results demonstrate the promise of this approach for building on-device conversational agents that are both immediately responsive and knowledgeable.

Result: Fine-tuned encoder models outperform instruction-tuned LLMs by over 10 percentage points in F1 score. Additionally, incorporating contextual metadata improves encoder models' performance from 0.75 to 0.78.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of supervised models for non-English NLP tasks and the role of metadata in improving performance. The release of the dataset, guidelines, and code aims to promote reproducibility and transparency.

Abstract: We introduce SPOT (Stopping Points in Online Threads), the first annotated corpus translating the sociological concept of stopping point into a reproducible NLP task. Stopping points are ordinary critical interventions that pause or redirect online discussions through a range of forms (irony, subtle doubt or fragmentary arguments) that frameworks like counterspeech or social correction often overlook. We operationalize this concept as a binary classification task and provide reliable annotation guidelines. The corpus contains 43,305 manually annotated French Facebook comments linked to URLs flagged as false information by social media users, enriched with contextual metadata (article, post, parent comment, page or group, and source). We benchmark fine-tuned encoder models (CamemBERT) and instruction-tuned LLMs under various prompting strategies. Results show that fine-tuned encoders outperform prompted LLMs in F1 score by more than 10 percentage points, confirming the importance of supervised learning for emerging non-English social media tasks. Incorporating contextual metadata further improves encoder models F1 scores from 0.75 to 0.78. We release the anonymized dataset, along with the annotation guidelines and code in our code repository, to foster transparency and reproducible research.

*Joel Valdivia Ortega,Lorenz Lamm,Franziska Eckardt,Benedikt Schworm,Marion Jasnin,Tingying Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization to improve interpretability and alignment of vision transformers, especially in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of low interpretability in Vision Transformers (ViTs), particularly in the context of medical imaging and domain shifts.

Method: Proposes Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, integrated with DINOv2 for fine-tuning using contrastive learning.

Result: RMLP enhances semantic alignment, maintains or improves performance, and produces interpretable attention maps across medical and natural images.

Conclusion: RMLP contributes to improved ViT-based models in terms of transparency and effectiveness, especially in challenging domains like medical imaging.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as DINOv2, achieve strong performance across domains but often repurpose low-informative patch tokens in ways that reduce the interpretability of attention and feature maps. This challenge is especially evident in medical imaging, where domain shifts can degrade both performance and transparency. In this paper, we introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations. We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning.

### [180] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Sparse Intent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new minimalistic approach for end-to-end autonomous driving that uses semantically rich tokens instead of exhaustive scene modeling or complex predictions. It achieves competitive results on the nuPlan benchmark while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to question and improve the traditional assumption that autonomous driving systems require computationally intensive scene modeling for effective operation.

Method: Utilizing sparse, semantically rich tokens for planning, and validating their effectiveness with perception-informed BEV representations on the nuPlan benchmark.

Result: The approach achieves 0.548 m ADE without future prediction and further improves to 0.479 m ADE with conditioned future tokens, outperforming previous baselines. Temporal fuzziness enhances performance in uncertain conditions.

Conclusion: The work introduces a paradigm shift from scene modeling to semantic understanding, advocating for systems inspired by cognitive planning rather than exhaustive reactions.

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our "token is all you need" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in OCR systems and presents an AI platform integrating OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph analytics for improved data extraction from varied document layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional OCR systems struggle with variant invoice layouts, handwritten texts, and low-quality scans due to template dependencies. The paper aims to address these limitations and improve flexibility and accuracy in data extraction.

Method: The authors propose an AI platform combining OCR technology, deep learning models, Large Language Models (LLMs), domain-specific models, and graph analytics for holistic data extraction.

Result: The AI platform shows higher accuracy, consistency, and contextual sensitivity in extracting data from diverse document types.

Conclusion: The proposed platform effectively surpasses conventional OCR limitations, enabling advanced extraction pipelines, scalability, and reduced human intervention with hybrid architectures.

Abstract: Conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are challenged by
variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low- quality scans, which are
often caused by strong template dependencies that restrict their flexibility
across different document structures and layouts. Newer solutions utilize
advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as
well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and
accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language
Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with
sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex
contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification.
Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from
invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy
rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid
architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and
minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial
Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph
analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.

*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of vision-language models (VLMs) with in-context learning (ICL) for assessing the quality of printed parts in additive manufacturing, reducing the need for large datasets while achieving comparable accuracy to traditional models and providing interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data collection and model training for vision-based quality assessment in additive manufacturing can be expensive and time-intensive. The authors aim to address these challenges by leveraging VLMs and their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors introduced in-context learning (ICL) combined with VLMs to provide application-specific knowledge. They explored sampling strategies and assessed the results using two VLMs on wire-laser direct energy deposition quality classification tasks.

Result: ICL-assisted VLMs achieved quality classification accuracy comparable to traditional machine learning models while requiring minimal samples. VLMs also provided human-interpretable rationales, enhancing transparency.

Conclusion: ICL and VLMs successfully address application-specific tasks in additive manufacturing with limited data, offering high accuracy and improved decision transparency through valid rationales. The authors also proposed metrics to evaluate rationale quality.

Abstract: Vision-based quality assessment in additive manufacturing often requires dedicated machine learning models and application-specific datasets. However, data collection and model training can be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales. Our results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can address application-specific tasks with limited data, achieving relatively high accuracy while also providing valid supporting rationales for improved decision transparency.

TL;DR: EVLP introduces a unified multimodal framework for planning in embodied, long-horizon tasks by integrating language reasoning and visual generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to unify linguistic reasoning and visual-spatial planning in a seamless framework for long-horizon tasks, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: EVLP deploys a unified framework with multimodal attention mechanisms, dynamic perception pretraining, and reinforced supervised fine-tuning.

Result: EVLP demonstrates improved multimodal planning capabilities and more accurate spatio-temporal coordination.

Conclusion: The presented EVLP framework effectively integrates language and vision, overcoming limitations of existing systems and advancing embodied task manipulation processes.

Abstract: In complex embodied long-horizon manipulation tasks, effective task decomposition and execution require synergistic integration of textual logical reasoning and visual-spatial imagination to ensure efficient and accurate operation. Current methods fail to adopt a unified generation framework for multimodal planning, lead to inconsistent in multimodal planning. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{EVLP (Embodied Vision-Language Planner)}, an innovative multimodal unified generation framework that jointly models linguistic reasoning and visual generation. Our approach achieves multimodal planning for long-horizon tasks through a novel training pipeline incorporating dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment. Our core innovations consist of three key components: \textbf{1) Unified Multimodal Generation Framework}: For understanding, We integrate semantic information with spatial features to provide comprehensive visual perception. For generation, we directly learn the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention mechanisms. \textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations within a unified feature space. \textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}: While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space, we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared multimodal planning capabilities.

*Chenping Pei,Fadi Dornaika,Jingjun Bi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel Multi-View Clustering approach called MCFCN that addresses the challenges in existing MVC methods, such as topological structure neglect, cross-view consistency, and sample distinguishment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVC methods fail to consider data's inherent topological structure and suffer from issues like noisy graph input and lack of cross-view consistency.

Method: The proposed MCFCN method incorporates a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network, Unified Graph Structure Adapter, and novel loss functions (SMAL and FRAL) for effective consensus representation learning.

Result: MCFCN shows state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmark datasets while validating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MCFCN overcomes limitations of prior methods by improving representation learning, optimizing view-specific graphs, and promoting topological consistency, leading to enhanced multi-view clustering results.

Abstract: Existing Multi-view Clustering (MVC) methods based on subspace learning focus on consensus representation learning while neglecting the inherent topological structure of data. Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations. The code will be provided at https://github.com/texttao/MCFCN.

*Jiayuan Wang,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Ning Zhang,Katsuya Suto,Lei Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a compression framework for multi-task models used in autonomous driving systems, showing significant reductions in parameters and maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing complexity of multi-task learning for autonomous driving perception, deployment on on-board devices becomes challenging due to high model parameters and computational demands.

Method: The framework combines safe pruning techniques using Taylor-based channel importance and gradient conflict penalty with feature-level knowledge distillation, ensuring minimal performance degradation post-compression.

Result: Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a 32.7% reduction in parameters with negligible accuracy loss in segmentation and slight decrease in detection metrics, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 32.7 FPS.

Conclusion: The approach successfully shows that combining pruning and knowledge distillation is a viable solution for compressing multi-task models without significant performance compromises, enabling efficient deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic perception to jointly handle object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception.

*Jiali Gao,Taoran Liu,Hongfei Ye,Jianjun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FilletRec, a graph neural network for automated fillet recognition and simplification in CAD models. It outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve robustness and accuracy in fillet recognition for CAE analysis, as traditional methods and deep learning models fail to handle complex geometric patterns effectively.

Method: The paper constructs a large-scale benchmark dataset for training and implements a lightweight graph neural network (FilletRec) using intrinsic geometric features like curvature to identify fillets in CAD models with high precision.

Result: FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and generalization, using only 0.2%-5.4% of the parameters of other models, showcasing significant improvement in efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end framework, FilletRec, efficiently automates fillet recognition and simplification, proving its utility in improving CAE workflows with high model efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Automated recognition and simplification of fillet features in CAD models is critical for CAE analysis, yet it remains an open challenge. Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\%-5.4\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the M2S2L framework for video anomaly detection, emphasizing efficiency and accuracy using multi-scale spatial-temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in traditional video anomaly detection methods, which either struggle with complex video scenarios or require excessive computational resources for real-time use.

Method: M2S2L uses hierarchical spatial encoders and multi-temporal encoders for better spatial-temporal modeling, along with task-specific feature optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction.

Result: M2S2L achieves high frame-level AUCs (98.5% for UCSD Ped2, 92.1% for CUHK Avenue, and 77.9% for ShanghaiTech) while maintaining computational efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS.

Conclusion: The M2S2L framework provides an effective solution to balance detection accuracy and computational efficiency for practical video surveillance applications.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an essential task in the image processing community with prospects in video surveillance, which faces fundamental challenges in balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in few-shot object detection for biomedical microscopy using a novel benchmark dataset, demonstrating the potential of in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in utilizing state-of-the-art VLMs for biomedical microscopy, where large annotated datasets are often unavailable, hindering object detection tasks.

Method: The researchers developed the Micro-OD benchmark with 252 annotated images and evaluated eight VLMs under few-shot settings, implementing a hybrid detection pipeline to enhance performance.

Result: The study found that while zero-shot performance is weak due to domain gaps, few-shot learning significantly improves detection performance, with reasoning tokens aiding end-to-end localization.

Conclusion: In-context learning is a practical and effective approach for advancing few-shot object detection in biomedical microscopy, providing a pathway to mitigate challenges in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Foundation vision-language models (VLMs) excel on natural images, but their utility for biomedical microscopy remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops. Our results highlight in-context adaptation as a practical path for microscopy, and our benchmark provides a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PTRN-HAR, a novel pre-trained model-based continual learning approach adapted for sensor-based human activity recognition, addressing challenges of data scarcity and computational inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) models post-deployment by enabling efficient incremental learning with limited labeled data.

Method: The paper introduces PTRN-HAR, which uses contrastive loss for pre-training a feature extractor with limited data, freezes the extractor during continual learning, and employs a relation module network as the classifier.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show PTRN-HAR outperforms state-of-the-art models in efficiency and performance, requiring fewer labeled samples for continual learning.

Conclusion: PTRN-HAR effectively reduces training resource consumption and demonstrates improved data efficiency, paving the way for better OCL implementations in sensor-based HAR.

Abstract: Machine learning models for sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) are expected to adapt post-deployment to recognize new activities and different ways of performing existing ones. To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a registration-free method to monitor unstructured point cloud data of 3D objects using intrinsic geometric features, avoiding common preprocessing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a more efficient and accurate monitoring approach for 3D point cloud data, as traditional preprocessing steps like registration and mesh reconstruction are error-prone, time-consuming, and introduce artifacts.

Method: The paper introduces a registration-free approach that uses two feature learning methods based on intrinsic geometric properties (Laplacian and geodesic distances) along with a monitoring scheme that applies thresholding techniques.

Result: The proposed approach was effective in identifying various types of defects through numerical experiments and case studies.

Conclusion: The novel monitoring method eliminates the need for registration and mesh reconstruction, streamlining the process of defect detection in point cloud data of complex shapes.

Abstract: Modern sensing technologies have enabled the collection of unstructured point cloud data (PCD) of varying sizes, which are used to monitor the geometric accuracy of 3D objects. PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions. Numerical experiments and case studies highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying different types of defects.

*Shin Kamada,Takumi Ichimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposal and implementation of Adaptive Deep Belief Network (DBN) for road network detection using aerial images, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and practical application for disaster scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve road network detection from aerial images for complicated and challenging features, with potential applications in disaster recovery.

Method: Use Adaptive DBN with a Teacher-Student ensemble learning model to optimally adjust network structure using neuron generation-annihilation and layer generation algorithms.

Result: Increased detection accuracy from 40% to 89% across multiple cities; implemented lightweight model for rapid disaster response using satellite images.

Conclusion: Adaptive DBN effectively enhances road detection, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements and practical application in disaster scenarios, including compact implementation for edge devices.

Abstract: An adaptive structural learning method of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been developed as one of prominent deep learning models. The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\% to 89.0\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small size of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as lightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite image before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan.

*Milad Malekzadeh,Elias Willberg,Jussi Torkko,Silviya Korpilo,Kamyar Hasanzadeh,Olle Järv,Tuuli Toivonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares Street View Imagery-based predictions of urban attractiveness to Public Participation GIS-reported experiences, finding partial alignment and emphasizing the value of combining both approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different data sources capture human perceptions of urban environments and to assess their comparability for spatial planning.

Method: A machine learning model was trained using participant-rated Street View Imagery data and semantic image segmentation to predict perceived attractiveness. Agreement between these predictions and PPGIS-reported locations was calculated using strict and moderate criteria.

Result: Partial alignment was found: moderate agreement reached 67% for attractive places and 77% for unattractive places, while strict agreement dropped to 27% and 29%. Non-visual variables like noise and activity levels contributed to mismatches in perception.

Conclusion: SVI is scalable and useful for visual urban perception but lacks experiential richness captured by PPGIS. An integrated approach combining both methods is recommended for comprehensive urban studies.

Abstract: As digital tools increasingly shape spatial planning practices, understanding how different data sources reflect human experiences of urban environments is essential. Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.

*Xiaofei Wang,Stephen Price,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces C3-Diff, a framework using cross-modal contrastive learning and diffusion models to enhance spatial transcriptomics (ST) with histology images, addressing low resolution challenges in ST data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the low resolution and sensitivity in current spatial transcriptomics platforms, which hinders detailed molecular mechanism discovery and spatial gene expression analysis.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework C3-Diff that refines traditional contrastive learning, incorporates nosing-based information augmentation, and employs a dynamic imputation strategy to effectively enhance ST maps using histology images.

Result: C3-Diff outperformed competing methods across four public datasets and showed effectiveness in downstream tasks like cell type localization, gene expression correlation, and single-cell-level gene expression prediction.

Conclusion: C3-Diff represents a significant step forward in integrating histology images with spatial transcriptomics to overcome resolution and sensitivity limitations, paving the way for improved biomedical research and potential clinical applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST), i.e., spatial gene expressions, has made it possible to measure gene expression within original tissue, enabling us to discover molecular mechanisms. However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

### [194] [Video Text Preservation with Synthetic Text-Rich Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05573)
*Ziyang Liu,Kevin Valencia,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight method to enhance text clarity in Text-To-Video models using synthetic supervision techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-To-Video models struggle with generating coherent and legible text in video sequences, necessitating innovative solutions for improvement.

Method: The authors employ a two-step approach: (1) Generate text-rich images using Text-To-Image models, (2) Animate these images into videos using a text-agnostic image-to-video model. These synthetic video-prompt pairs are then used to fine-tune an existing Text-To-Video model without architectural changes.

Result: The proposed method improves short-text legibility and temporal consistency, showing promise for handling longer textual prompts through structural priors.

Conclusion: Curated synthetic supervision and weak inference strategies are effective for enhancing text rendering in Text-To-Video systems, paving the path for better textual fidelity.

Abstract: While Text-To-Video (T2V) models have advanced rapidly, they continue to struggle with generating legible and coherent text within videos. In particular, existing models often fail to render correctly even short phrases or words and previous attempts to address this problem are computationally expensive and not suitable for video generation. In this work, we investigate a lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic supervision. We first generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, then animate them into short videos using a text-agnostic image-to-video (I2v) model. These synthetic video-prompt pairs are used to fine-tune Wan2.1, a pre-trained T2V model, without any architectural changes. Our results show improvement in short-text legibility and temporal consistency with emerging structural priors for longer text. These findings suggest that curated synthetic data and weak supervision offer a practical path toward improving textual fidelity in T2V generation.

*Stanislav Selitskiy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a supervising neural network to improve AI self-awareness by detecting and addressing uncertainties in another neural network’s predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to emulate self-awareness in AI systems, a trait essential for Artificial General Intelligence, to make intelligent systems capable of identifying and correcting their errors.

Method: By using a supervising artificial neural network to monitor the activation patterns of a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble, the model detects high uncertainty and adjusts its learning parameters based on stored performance history.

Result: The supervising network evaluates trustworthiness and initiates an active learning mechanism, where the algorithm can request human help when uncertain.

Conclusion: The approach integrates elements of agency and self-awareness into machine learning, enhancing reliability in tasks like face recognition and facial expression analysis.

Abstract: Reflection on one's thought process and making corrections to it if there exists dissatisfaction in its performance is, perhaps, one of the essential traits of intelligence. However, such high-level abstract concepts mandatory for Artificial General Intelligence can be modelled even at the low level of narrow Machine Learning algorithms. Here, we present the self-awareness mechanism emulation in the form of a supervising artificial neural network (ANN) observing patterns in activations of another underlying ANN in a search for indications of the high uncertainty of the underlying ANN and, therefore, the trustworthiness of its predictions. The underlying ANN is a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble employed for face recognition and facial expression tasks. The self-awareness ANN has a memory region where its past performance information is stored, and its learnable parameters are adjusted during the training to optimize the performance. The trustworthiness verdict triggers the active learning mode, giving elements of agency to the machine learning algorithm that asks for human help in high uncertainty and confusion conditions.

*Weston Bondurant,Arkaprava Sinha,Hieu Le,Srijan Das,Stephanie Schuckers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiffSwap++, a diffusion-based face-swapping system that uses 3D facial features to enhance identity preservation and geometric consistency, showcasing superior results compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in face-swapping techniques, particularly the poor identity preservation and artifacts under challenging facial poses and expressions, and the lack of leveraging 3D facial structure effectively.

Method: Proposes DiffSwap++, a diffusion-based pipeline that integrates 3D facial latent features and uses a tailored diffusion architecture with identity embeddings and facial landmarks for enhanced face-swapping quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets like CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text show DiffSwap++ significantly outperforms existing methods in identity preservation, geometric consistency, and realism.

Conclusion: DiffSwap++ achieves realistic, high-fidelity face swaps by utilizing 3D-aware features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, and contributing to advancements in diffusion-based face-swapping technologies.

Abstract: Diffusion-based approaches have recently achieved strong results in face swapping, offering improved visual quality over traditional GAN-based methods. However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

### [197] [Beyond Softmax: Dual-Branch Sigmoid Architecture for Accurate Class Activation Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05590)
*Yoojin Oh,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-branch sigmoid head architecture to address distortions caused by using a softmax classifier in Class Activation Mapping (CAM), improving localization and explanation fidelity without compromising classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAM methods face distortions such as additive logit shifts and sign collapse due to reliance on softmax classifiers, leading to biased importance scores and ineffective visualizations.

Method: The paper introduces a dual-branch approach where a cloned sigmoid head is added to pretrained models, fine-tuned with binary supervision for better evidence maps while retaining the original softmax for classification.

Result: Extensive evaluations show enhanced explanation fidelity, consistent Top-1 Localization gains, and no drop in recognition accuracy across fine-grained tasks and WSOL benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses CAM distortions, integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants, and improves localization performance with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its extensions have become indispensable tools for visualizing the evidence behind deep network predictions. However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a MedGemma-based framework for automatic abnormality detection in musculoskeletal radiographs. Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation.

*Subash Gautam,Alejandro Vargas-Uscategui,Peter King,Hans Lohr,Alireza Bab-Hadiashar,Ivan Cole,Ehsan Asadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses a monitoring system that detects shape deviations during high deposition rate robotic additive manufacturing to improve part quality and reduce error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring shape accuracy in additive manufacturing, particularly high deposition rate robotic additive manufacturing, is challenging due to process instabilities that lead to deviations. Detecting these deviations in real-time is crucial for efficient manufacturing.

Method: The paper introduces a real-time monitoring system that reconstructs the growing part and compares it with a reference model to identify and track shape deviations during the additive manufacturing process.

Result: The study enables early detection and tracking of shape inconsistencies in additive manufacturing processes, facilitating timely intervention and correction.

Conclusion: The proposed system enhances shape accuracy and minimizes post-processing needs, enabling consistent quality in high-speed robotic additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging digital manufacturing technology to produce complex and freeform objects through a layer-wise deposition. High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates distributed deep learning techniques for denoising chest X-ray images using U-Net and U-Net++ architectures, achieving faster training with high image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance medical image processing by improving image quality while minimizing sensitive information exposure, focusing on efficient distributed training methods.

Method: The authors evaluated U-Net and U-Net++ architectures for denoising chest X-ray images using distributed training methods like PyTorch's DDP and AMP. Performance was compared under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU, and optimized multi-GPU training.

Result: U-Net++ provided superior denoising performance in PSNR and SSIM, but slightly lower LPIPS than U-Net. Optimized training reduced time by over 60% vs single-GPU and outperformed standard multi-GPU with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of combining architectural innovations, lightweight obfuscation, and distributed training optimizations to enhance medical imaging pipelines, making them faster and effective for real-world use.

Abstract: Medical image denoising is essential for improving image quality while minimizing the exposure of sensitive information, particularly when working with large-scale clinical datasets. This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe) to improve text-to-3D generation by leveraging the Schrödinger Bridge framework, overcoming limitations like over-saturation and over-smoothing in prior techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenge of artifacts like over-saturation and over-smoothing in current text-to-3D generative methods using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS).

Method: Reformulates SDS as a Schrödinger Bridge framework and proposes a new generation method, TraCe, which constructs diffusion bridges and trains a LoRA-adapted model on these trajectories.

Result: TraCe produces high-quality, artifact-free 3D assets and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates how the Schrödinger Bridge framework can improve text-to-3D generation by providing a mathematically robust and effective solution to mitigate artifacts in generated 3D assets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in optimization-based text-to-3D generation heavily rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models using techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which often introduce artifacts such as over-saturation and over-smoothing into the generated 3D assets. In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: The paper presents a multi-level motion parsing framework for human pose-based action quality assessment (AQA), enhancing pose feature learning and achieving excellent results in diving sports datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing subtle spatial-temporal pose differences critical in high-level competitions for distinguishing performance quality.

Method: A novel framework leveraging pose extraction for action segmentation (Action-Unit Parser), spatial-temporal feature learning (Motion Parser), condition scoring (Condition Parser), and advanced scoring customization (Weight-Adjust Scoring Module).

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in action segmentation and scoring tasks on large-scale diving datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances AQA by effectively capturing nuanced pose variations, segmenting actions, and addressing diverse scoring requirements for high-level performance analysis.

Abstract: Human pose serves as a cornerstone of action quality assessment (AQA), where subtle spatial-temporal variations in pose often distinguish excellence from mediocrity. In high-level competitions, these nuanced differences become decisive factors in scoring. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level motion parsing framework for AQA based on enhanced spatial-temporal pose features. On the first level, the Action-Unit Parser is designed with the help of pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and comprehensive local-global pose representations. On the second level, Motion Parser is used by spatial-temporal feature learning to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. Meanwhile, some special conditions other than body-related will impact action scoring, like water splash in diving. In this work, we design an additional Condition Parser to offer users more flexibility in their choices. Finally, Weight-Adjust Scoring Module is introduced to better accommodate the diverse requirements of various action types and the multi-scale nature of action-units. Extensive evaluations on large-scale diving sports datasets demonstrate that our multi-level motion parsing framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both action segmentation and action scoring tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first personalized image editing framework in diffusion models, utilizing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO) to adapt image edits to individual user preferences and collaborative signals for improved coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most text-to-image diffusion models do not cater to specific aesthetic preferences of individual users, limiting their personalization and usability.

Method: The approach (C-DPO) uses a graph neural network to encode user preferences as nodes in a dynamic graph and integrates these embeddings into a custom DPO objective to enhance a diffusion model's personalization and neighborhood coherence.

Result: Experimental studies, including user feedback and quantitative measures, show that the proposed C-DPO framework surpasses baseline methods in aligning image edits to user preferences.

Conclusion: The work establishes a novel and effective means of personalizing image editing in diffusion models, improving both alignment with individual user tastes and collaborative preference signals.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating and editing high-fidelity images from text. Yet, these models remain fundamentally generic, failing to adapt to the nuanced aesthetic preferences of individual users. In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet struggles with performance, speed, and efficiency on complex datasets compared to CNNs, motivating the need for enhanced capsule creation methods.

Method: CFC-CapsNet proposes a novel Convolutional Fully-Connected (CFC) layer to create fewer, but more powerful capsules to address limitations of CapsNet.

Result: CFC-CapsNet demonstrated improved accuracy, faster training and inference speeds, and reduced parameters in tests with CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST.

Conclusion: CFC-CapsNet offers a viable enhancement to CapsNet, mitigating its drawbacks while maintaining its advantages in feature learning and classification.

Abstract: A Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a relatively new classifier and one of the possible successors of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CapsNet maintains the spatial hierarchies between the features and outperforms CNNs at classifying images including overlapping categories. Even though CapsNet works well on small-scale datasets such as MNIST, it fails to achieve a similar level of performance on more complicated datasets and real applications. In addition, CapsNet is slow compared to CNNs when performing the same task and relies on a higher number of parameters. In this work, we introduce Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet) to address the shortcomings of CapsNet by creating capsules using a different method. We introduce a new layer (CFC layer) as an alternative solution to creating capsules. CFC-CapsNet produces fewer, yet more powerful capsules resulting in higher network accuracy. Our experiments show that CFC-CapsNet achieves competitive accuracy, faster training and inference and uses less number of parameters on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and Fashion-MNIST datasets compared to conventional CapsNet.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel model combining world dynamics and human pose data for improved action recognition, excelling in complex, occlusive scenes based on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models rely on RGB video and focus on statistical patterns, lacking the ability to capture deeper physical interaction dynamics and human poses.

Method: The model integrates V-JEPA 2's predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's human pose data to enhance action recognition grounded in physical space.

Result: The model outperformed baselines on the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks, showcasing significant improvements in occlusive settings.

Conclusion: Action recognition models must prioritize spatial understanding over statistical recognition, as demonstrated by this research.

Abstract: For embodied agents to effectively understand and interact within the world around them, they require a nuanced comprehension of human actions grounded in physical space. Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Argus, an optimized system for improving throughput in text-to-image (T2I) inference by using prompt-specific approximations and maintaining quality standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models suffer from high inference time due to their compute-bound iterative denoising process, posing challenges for designing a scalable and high-throughput system.

Method: The authors propose Argus, a system that dynamically calibrates approximation strategies per input prompt to optimize throughput while minimizing quality loss.

Result: Argus leads to 10x fewer latency violations, 10% better average quality, and 40% increased throughput on real-world workloads compared to baseline systems.

Conclusion: Argus demonstrates significant improvements in throughput and quality for T2I models, addressing the constraints of high computational costs in current systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have gained significant popularity. Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements. Overall, Argus achieves 10x fewer latency service-level objective (SLO) violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating the cultural faithfulness of text-to-image (T2I) models, focusing on cross-cultural activities and providing metrics to assess their cultural alignment and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cultural biases and lack of faithful representation of underrepresented regions and social activities within text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: Developed CULTIVate, a benchmark with 16 countries, 576 prompts, over 19,000 images, and an evaluation framework based on cultural dimensions, supported by metrics for alignment, hallucination, exaggeration, and diversity.

Result: Findings indicate disparities in T2I model performance, with better results for global north countries compared to global south, highlighting systematic biases and failure modes.

Conclusion: The metrics introduced, coupled with CULTIVate, provide a strong correlation with human judgments, revealing cultural biases in T2I models and advancing methods for culturally faithful generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieve impressive photorealism by training on large-scale web data, but models inherit cultural biases and fail to depict underrepresented regions faithfully. Existing cultural benchmarks focus mainly on object-centric categories (e.g., food, attire, and architecture), overlooking the social and daily activities that more clearly reflect cultural norms. Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity. Our findings reveal systematic disparities: models perform better for global north countries than for the global south, with distinct failure modes across T2I systems. Human studies confirm that our metrics correlate more strongly with human judgments than existing text-image metrics.

*Yujin Potter,Zhun Wang,Nicholas Crispino,Kyle Montgomery,Alexander Xiong,Ethan Y. Chang,Francesco Pinto,Yuqi Chen,Rahul Gupta,Morteza Ziyadi,Christos Christodoulopoulos,Bo Li,Chenguang Wang,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VMDT, a unified benchmarking platform for evaluating trustworthiness in video foundation models, highlighting deficiencies in current approaches and emphasizing the need for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the lack of comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks for video foundation models, despite advancements in foundation models for other modalities like text and images.

Method: The authors developed VMDT, a framework to evaluate video foundation models across five trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. They applied it to evaluate a set of T2V and V2T models.

Result: The study revealed major deficiencies in open-source video models, such as their inability to identify harmful queries, fairness discrepancies, and privacy risks exacerbated by scaling. Although certain aspects improved, overall trustworthiness remains low, necessitating further development.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of designing more reliable and trustworthy video foundation models and provides VMDT as a systematic framework to evaluate and measure progress in this domain.

Abstract: As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring their trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical; yet, unlike text and image, the video modality still lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks. We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method ensuring accurate pedicle screw matching and pose estimation in surgery through dual C-arm images, improving alignment and surgical outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve challenges in pedicle screw correspondence, particularly in lateral views, critical for successful spinal surgeries.

Method: The method uses dual C-arm imaging paired with 2D-3D alignment and screw CAD 3D models for precise screw pairing and pose estimation.

Result: The method achieves consistent accuracy, with correct pairings outperforming incorrect ones and significantly reducing projection errors after registration.

Conclusion: The approach holds potential for enhancing spinal surgery outcomes by improving screw positioning reliability.

Abstract: Accurate matching of pedicle screws in both anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) images is critical for successful spinal decompression and stabilization during surgery. However, establishing screw correspondence, especially in LAT views, remains a significant clinical challenge. This paper introduces a method to address pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation from dual C-arm images. By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration. After registration, the correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error. This approach shows promise for improving surgical outcomes in spinal procedures by providing reliable feedback on screw positioning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal reasoning dataset generation framework with over 1M vision-centric questions, achieving high performance across benchmarks and transferability to different modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic methods for creating large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets beyond visual math and to understand effective data synthesis techniques.

Method: The framework generates reasoning traces in two stages: scaling and complexity, using Vision and Language Models (VLMs) and reasoning LLMs to synthesize non-linear reasoning traces.

Result: Finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the dataset outperformed all open benchmarks and strong closed models. It demonstrated positive transfer to text-only, audio reasoning, and even embodied QA despite lacking video/embodied visual data.

Conclusion: The synthesized data and methods enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities, improve cross-modal generalization, reduce compute demands, and highlight effective strategies for post-training using offline and online RL pipelines.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been driven largely by undisclosed datasets and proprietary data synthesis recipes, leaving open questions about how to systematically build large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets, particularly for tasks that go beyond visual math. In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.

*Xing Yao,Ahana Gangopadhyay,Hsi-Ming Chang,Ravi Soni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates adapting Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for ultrasound video segmentation by focusing on data characteristics and training strategies, rather than architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges posed by ultrasound video segmentation, including variability and limited annotated data, and address the limitations of foundation models like SAM2 in medical domains.

Method: The paper conducts systematic experiments regarding training data characteristics, video duration, augmentation schemes, and adaptation paradigms (task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task training) on SAM2 variants and prompting modes.

Result: Findings highlight the importance of data scale and temporal context over model architecture or initialization, and demonstrate the efficiency of joint training for balancing modality alignment and task specialization.

Conclusion: Efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines can optimize SAM2 performance for ultrasound video segmentation, emphasizing data-focused approaches over purely architectural ones.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) video segmentation remains a challenging problem due to strong inter- and intra-dataset variability, motion artifacts, and limited annotated data. Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization. This work aims to provide empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis.

*Mateo Ortiz,Juan Olmos,Fabio Martínez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning method, introducing the second-order geometric attention (SOGA) for accurate csPCa lesion detection/segmentation, achieving strong performance on prostate imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) lesions from MRI, including expert-dependent interpretation, annotation reliance, and variability across prostate zones.

Method: The authors propose a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism modeled on the Riemannian manifold, enhancing segmentation through skip connections in networks like U-Net and nnU-Net.

Result: The proposed method achieves an AP of 0.37 and AUC-ROC of 0.83 on the PI-CAI dataset and performs robustly on the Prostate158 dataset with comparable metrics.

Conclusion: The SOGA mechanism improves prostate cancer lesion detection accuracy and generalizes well across datasets, outperforming baseline and attention-based methods.

Abstract: The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions. The proposed attention is modeled on the Riemannian manifold, learning from symmetric positive definitive (SPD) representations. The proposed mechanism was integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones, and was validated on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.83, outperforming baseline networks and attention-based methods. Furthermore, the approach was evaluated on the Prostate158 dataset as an independent test cohort, achieving an AP of 0.37 and an AUC-ROC of 0.75, confirming robust generalization and suggesting discriminative learned representations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes TCSA-UDA, a framework leveraging textual class descriptions to improve performance in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for medical image segmentation tasks across various imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of substantial domain shifts in medical imaging modalities (e.g., CT to MRI segmentation tasks), which hinder accurate unsupervised domain adaptation approaches.

Method: The TCSA-UDA framework incorporates domain-invariant textual descriptions to guide visual representation learning using a vision-language covariance cosine loss and a prototype alignment module for class-wise pixel distribution alignment.

Result: Experiments on cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation datasets demonstrate superior performance and reduced domain shifts compared to state-of-the-art UDA methods.

Conclusion: The TCSA-UDA framework sets a new standard by integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image segmentation, showing its effectiveness in overcoming cross-modality challenges.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge due to substantial domain shifts across imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI. While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the time-consuming nature of Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) System Matrix (SM) calibration and improve its efficiency using positional priors.

Method: The authors incorporate symmetric positional priors into existing deep learning-based super-resolution frameworks for SM calibration, supported by theoretical justification and experimental validation.

Result: Incorporating positional priors into reconstruction frameworks improved the calibration process, demonstrated through 2D and 3D System Matrix super-resolution experiments.

Conclusion: Integrating positional priors successfully enhanced SM calibration efficiency and accuracy, making MPI reconstruction more practical.

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel medical imaging modality. One of the established methods for MPI reconstruction is based on the System Matrix (SM). However, the calibration of the SM is often time-consuming and requires repeated measurements whenever the system parameters change. Current methodologies utilize deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques to expedite SM calibration; nevertheless, these strategies do not fully exploit physical prior knowledge associated with the SM, such as symmetric positional priors. Consequently, we integrated positional priors into existing frameworks for SM calibration. Underpinned by theoretical justification, we empirically validated the efficacy of incorporating positional priors through experiments involving both 2D and 3D SM SR methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a MACMD-based decoder for medical image segmentation to address deep-layer information loss and inefficient integration of local and global contextual details, improving segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to anatomical variation and limitations of existing methods in preserving local details and modeling global dependencies.

Method: The proposed solution involves the MACMD-based decoder, leveraging hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module with skip connections to enhance integration between encoder and decoder.

Result: The proposed approach, tested with multiple transformer encoders, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The MACMD-based decoder effectively improves medical image segmentation by addressing critical limitations, achieving more accurate and efficient results, and is publicly available for further advancement.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to variations in anatomical structures. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation. We evaluated our approach using multiple transformer encoders on both binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving accurate and robust segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing a reliable and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains unsolved, primarily due to the limitations of existing text detection methods.

Method: A novel parameterized text shape representation based on low-rank approximation alongside a triple assignment detection head for detection, integrated with a lightweight recognition branch to create the LRANet++ framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LRANet++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency for arbitrary-shaped text spotting.

Conclusion: The proposed LRANet++ framework effectively advances the field of end-to-end text spotting by offering a reliable, efficient solution that surpasses existing methods in both detection and recognition of arbitrary-shaped text.

Abstract: End-to-end text spotting aims to jointly optimize text detection and recognition within a unified framework. Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hilbert curve-based method to optimize window formation and neighborhood structuring in attention mechanisms, particularly for high-resolution images, achieving significant speedups in processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the inefficiency of global self-attention that results in high computational and memory costs, particularly for high-resolution images, and seeks to improve local attention mechanisms which often fail to deliver desired speedups due to non-contiguous memory access patterns.

Method: The authors propose a novel reordering of image tokens along a Hilbert curve, followed by the creation of windows and neighborhoods based on this reordered sequence. This approach enhances block sparsity and integrates with block-sparse kernels for improved 2D local attention efficiency.

Result: By implementing the Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention frameworks, experiments demonstrate computational speedups of approximately $4\times$ for window attention and $18\times$ for slide attention, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels is a practical and generalizable strategy to significantly enhance the efficiency of 2D local attention for image analysis. The provided code supports reproducibility and real-world application.

Abstract: The quadratic compute and memory costs of global self-attention severely limit its use in high-resolution images. Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\times$ and $18\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance remote heart rate estimation using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). By addressing the inefficiency of transformer-based models, TYrPPG leverages the Mambaout-based structure for video analysis.

Method: The TYrPPG method introduces a gated video understanding block (GVB) combining 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN for video analysis, and comprehensive supervised loss functions (CSL) for learning capability improvement.

Result: Experiments demonstrated TYrPPG delivers state-of-the-art performance in heart rate estimation on widely-used datasets.

Conclusion: TYrPPG proves to be an efficient and superior solution for remote heart rate estimation, with prospects for broader applications in physiological signal extraction.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can remotely extract physiological signals from RGB video, which has many advantages in detecting heart rate, such as low cost and no invasion to patients. The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a lightweight framework to use a vision-language model (CLIP) for detecting Alzheimer's Disease through handwriting analysis, emphasizing task influence and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of handwriting analysis in early Alzheimer's Disease detection using advanced AI models, and to systematically study task-based generalization.

Method: The study proposes the Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework to adapt CLIP for handwriting-specific medical analysis, focusing on prompt-free, zero-shot inference capabilities.

Result: The framework demonstrates efficient cross-task generalization and identifies specific stroke patterns and task factors that best indicate Alzheimer's Disease.

Conclusion: Handwriting analysis through adapted vision-language models shows promise for cost-effective, non-invasive early Alzheimer's Disease screening, with insights into diagnostic features and benchmarks for cognitive assessment.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which early detection is critical. Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.

TL;DR: The paper addresses classifier-guided diffusion models' issue with overconfident early predictions by improving classifier calibration (Smooth ECE) and proposing enhanced, retraining-free sampling strategies, achieving better performance on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome overconfident predictions in early denoising processes of classifier-guided diffusion models, which lead to gradient vanishing and hinders effective conditional image generation.

Method: Proposed a differentiable calibration objective (Smooth ECE) and new sampling guidance strategies like tilted sampling, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling, and divergence-based sampling, all without requiring diffusion model retraining.

Result: The proposed methods, tested on ImageNet 128x128 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improve FID to 2.13, outperforming other methods without needing diffusion model retraining.

Conclusion: Combining classifier calibration with divergence-aware sampling techniques can enhance classifier-guided diffusion models by addressing overconfidence issues and improving image generation effectiveness.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

Method: The authors created a dataset called CPS3D-Seg that includes 1300 annotated point cloud samples. They benchmarked state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms with CPS3D-Seg and developed CINet, which uses causal inference with Structural Refine and Quality Assessment modules.

Result: CPS3D-Seg provides the highest point resolution and precision among industrial datasets. CINet showed remarkable improvements in point cloud segmentation performance, surpassing existing algorithms in metrics like mIoU and accuracy.

Conclusion: The research advances CPS surface defect detection by constructing a high-quality dataset and innovating segmentation methods, providing a foundation for enhanced industrial defect detection solutions.

Abstract: The effective segmentation of 3D data is crucial for a wide range of industrial applications, especially for detecting subtle defects in the field of integrated circuits (IC). Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CINet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in both mIoU and accuracy.

*Viet Nguyen,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), a framework to ensure safer generative AI by erasing harmful concepts without degrading model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often produce unsafe content, leading to critical safety concerns in their practical use. Current methods for concept erasure fail to balance safety with maintaining generative quality.

Method: The proposed CGCE framework utilizes a lightweight classifier on text embeddings to detect and refine unsafe prompts at inference time without altering model weights. It can handle multi-concept erasure by combining classifiers.

Result: CGCE demonstrates robust erasure against adversarial attacks while maintaining the original generative model's quality on safe prompts. It outperforms existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: CGCE is a scalable and practical solution that strikes a strong balance between robust safety measures and generative utility, making it effective for modern AI models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.

*Suresh Nehra,Aupendu Kar,Jayanta Mukhopadhyay,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a publicly available light field image dataset designed to assist in the development and testing of depth estimation algorithms using disparity in 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure availability of reliable and specific light field datasets for disparity-based depth estimation algorithms, overcoming the limitations of existing datasets.

Method: The authors created a dataset comprising 285 light field images captured with the Lytro Illum LF camera, 13 synthetic LF images, and stereo light field datasets using mechanical systems and Blender.

Result: A novel light field image dataset, combining real and synthetic data, with detailed documentation on its structure and content.

Conclusion: The dataset addresses the shortcomings of existing light field datasets and is made publicly accessible to support advancements in light field depth estimation research.

Abstract: A Light Field (LF) camera consists of an additional two-dimensional array of micro-lenses placed between the main lens and sensor, compared to a conventional camera. The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera. A real and synthetic stereo light field dataset is also created by using a mechanical gantry system and Blender. The dataset is available at https://github.com/aupendu/light-field-dataset.

### [225] [MoEGCL: Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning for Multi-View Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05876)
*Jian Zhu,Xin Zou,Jun Sun,Cheng Luo,Lei Liu,Lingfang Zeng,Ning Zhang,Bian Wu,Chang Tang,Lirong Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MoEGCL, a new method for fine-grained multi-view clustering using a Mixture of Ego-Graphs and contrastive representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view clustering methods using Graph Neural Networks suffer from coarse-grained graph fusion by relying on separate graphs per view and view-level fusion.

Method: This paper introduces two modules: (1) Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which applies sample-level fine-grained fusion of ego graphs using a Mixture-of-Experts network; (2) Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL), aligning fused and view-specific representations to enhance similarity at a cluster level.

Result: MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance in deep multi-view clustering tasks according to extensive experiments.

Conclusion: MoEGCL improves upon existing MVC methods by addressing coarse-grained graph fusion limitations and providing superior deep clustering performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.

### [226] [Towards Frequency-Adaptive Learning for SAR Despeckling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05890)
*Ziqing Ma,Chang Yang,Zhichang Guo,Yao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAR-FAH, a model using a divide-and-conquer architecture to despeckle SAR images by adapting to frequency-specific noise properties, achieving improved noise removal and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speckle noise in SAR images limits their application in tasks requiring high precision. Existing methods fail to adapt to varying speckle statistics across image regions, causing artifacts and distortions.

Method: The method employs a divide-and-conquer framework using wavelet decomposition to segment SAR images into frequency sub-bands, and customized sub-networks are designed for each frequency band. Low-frequency bands use neural ODEs for smooth denoising, while high-frequency bands utilize enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world SAR images show improved performance in reducing noise while preserving edges and textures compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The SAR-FAH model effectively addresses SAR image despeckling by leveraging frequency-specific noise properties, ensuring better image quality and structural preservation.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are inherently corrupted by speckle noise, limiting their utility in high-precision applications. While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.

Motivation: Face recognition systems face challenges due to occlusions and illumination variations, demanding robust new methods.

Method: Introduces H2H descriptor to capture local facial features, combined with SR_NMR regression and a global low-rank constraint.

Result: Achieves greater accuracy than existing methods, especially in scenarios with occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

Conclusion: The H2H-GLRSR model advances face recognition quality under complex conditions by leveraging novel features and constraints.

Abstract: Low-rank sparse regression models have been widely applied in the field of face recognition. To further address the challenges caused by complex occlusions and illumination variations, this paper proposes a Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram based Global Low-Rank Sparse Regression (H2H-GLRSR) model. Specifically, a novel feature descriptor called the Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram (H2H) is first designed to more effectively characterize the local structural features of facial images. Then, this descriptor is integrated with the Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR$\_$NMR). Moreover, a global low-rank constraint is imposed on the residual matrix, enabling the model to better capture the global correlations inherent in structured noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing regression-based classification approaches under challenging scenarios involving occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robust generalization and superior performance across tasks like scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning.

Conclusion: Combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning enhances scalable and effective 3D scene understanding in diverse environments.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes in open-world settings poses fundamental challenges for vision and robotics, particularly due to the limitations of closed-vocabulary supervision and static annotations. To address this, we propose a unified framework for Open-World 3D Scene Graph Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning, which enables generalizable and interactive 3D scene understanding. Our method integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with retrieval-based reasoning to support multimodal exploration and language-guided interaction. The framework comprises two key components: (1) a dynamic scene graph generation module that detects objects and infers semantic relationships without fixed label sets, and (2) a retrieval-augmented reasoning pipeline that encodes scene graphs into a vector database to support text/image-conditioned queries. We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning for scalable 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, generalizable, modular, and compatible with existing QAT techniques, enhancing quantized model performance without altering original architectures.

Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of quantization-aware training (QAT) in compressing deep neural networks, its performance on multi-task architectures often degrades significantly due to task-specific feature discrepancies and gradient conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints. Notably, the proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and compatible with any existing QAT technique-enhancing the performance of quantized models without requiring modifications to the original network architecture.

### [230] [Causal Tracing of Object Representations in Large Vision Language Models: Mechanistic Interpretability and Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05923)
*Qiming Li,Zekai Ye,Xiaocheng Feng,Weihong Zhong,Weitao Ma,Xiachong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limited mechanistic interpretability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and introduces a novel method, Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT), to analyze and improve their visual object perception capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current interpretability of LVLMs is limited, impeding understanding and improvement of their outputs, particularly for reducing hallucinations and improving their downstream tasks.

Method: The authors developed the FCCT framework to systematically analyze LVLMs by quantifying causal effects on visual object perception, examining visual and textual tokens, core components like multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states across layers.

Result: FCCT identifies that the MHSA in middle layers plays a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, and FFNs follow a hierarchical structure for managing visual object representations. A new technique, Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), is introduced, demonstrating improvements across benchmarks without affecting inference speed.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights into the functioning of LVLMs and a practical method to improve their performance and reduce hallucination, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), the mechanistic interpretability remains underexplored. Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.

*Jiaxuan Li,Qing Xu,Xiangjian He,Ziyu Liu,Chang Xing,Zhen Chen,Daokun Zhang,Rong Qu,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoMA, a complementary masking strategy for MAE, and DyViT, a dynamic hierarchical vision transformer, achieving faster pretraining efficiency and maintaining adaptability across downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAE methods face high pretraining costs and inefficient parameter use in ViT due to random masking and fixed spatial resolution.

Method: The authors introduce CoMA for uniform sampling and DyViT with Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention to reduce parameters and enhance feature learning.

Result: Using CoMA and DyViT on ImageNet-1K, the model achieves comparable performance with MAE using only 12% of pretraining epochs, alongside a 10% reduction in time per epoch.

Conclusion: CoMA and DyViT improve pretraining efficiency, adaptability, and computational cost while maintaining downstream task performance.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) achieve self-supervised learning of image representations by randomly removing a portion of visual tokens and reconstructing the original image as a pretext task, thereby significantly enhancing pretraining efficiency and yielding excellent adaptability across downstream tasks. However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.

*Ayantika Das,Arunima Sarkar,Keerthi Ram,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework to model and generate disease progression images in an unsupervised manner, addressing limitations in controllability of latent spaces in existing generative approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative approaches for modeling disease progression suffer from constraints in latent space distribution learning, limiting their ability to generate follow-up images in an unsupervised manner.

Method: The paper proposes a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework where latent spaces are compact and semantically rich, enabling controlled shifts restricted to a subspace linked to progression attributes, without requiring longitudinal image supervision.

Result: Validated results using Alzheimer's disease datasets show effective progression modeling, high-quality image generation, accurate volumetric progression analysis, and improved downstream classification results.

Conclusion: The framework succeeds in disentangling progression-related information in latent space for unsupervised longitudinal progression modeling, providing a promising solution for medical applications such as Alzheimer's disease monitoring.

Abstract: Generative modeling frameworks have emerged as an effective approach to capture high-dimensional image distributions from large datasets without requiring domain-specific knowledge, a capability essential for longitudinal disease progression modeling. Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation.

*Lin Li,Chuhan Zhang,Dong Zhang,Chong Sun,Chen Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an interaction-centric framework (ACC) for open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) to better distinguish interacting objects and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSGG methods struggle with distinguishing between interacting and non-interacting object instances due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, leading to issues in both knowledge infusion and transfer stages.

Method: The proposed ACC adopts an interaction-driven approach, employing a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision during knowledge infusion and interaction-guided query selection with knowledge distillation during knowledge transfer.

Result: ACC achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, showcasing its ability to handle interaction mismatches effectively compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: Interaction-centric paradigms like ACC are promising for enhancing OVSGG systems, improving their robustness and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\textbf{AC}tion-\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that ACC achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-centric paradigms for real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper presents GME-Net, a new network for recognizing facial expressions in low-resolution images, addressing challenges with details and global modeling to achieve improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression recognition algorithms struggle with low-resolution images due to lack of detail information and weak global modeling, which hinder feature extraction.

Method: They proposed a novel network, GME-Net, which includes a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module enhanced with attention similarity knowledge distillation, and a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show that GME-Net outperforms existing methods in recognizing facial expressions from low-resolution images.

Conclusion: GME-Net mitigates the challenges of low-resolution facial expression recognition by effectively extracting discriminative features, achieving superior results compared to current techniques.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition, as a vital computer vision task, is garnering significant attention and undergoing extensive research. Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for generating high-definition maps for autonomous driving systems using instance segmentation combined with a post-processing module to improve generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection-based methods for constructing high-definition maps in autonomous driving systems lack robust generalizability, which limits their effectiveness for auto-labeling.

Method: The proposed method reinterprets road elements as rasterized polygons and uses an end-to-end segmentation-based transformer to create instance masks. A Potrace-based post-processing module converts these masks into vectorized map elements.

Result: Quantitative evaluations on the Nuscene dataset show improved generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates promising results for enhancing environmental perception in autonomous driving systems through improved generalizability and effectiveness.

Abstract: The perception of high-definition maps is an integral component of environmental perception in autonomous driving systems. Existing research have often focused on online construction of high-definition maps. For instance, the Maptr[9] series employ a detection-based method to output vectorized map instances parallelly in an end-to-end manner. However, despite their capability for real-time construction, detection-based methods are observed to lack robust generalizability[19], which hampers their applicability in auto-labeling systems. Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements. Quantitative results attained on the Nuscene[1] dataset substantiate the effectiveness and generaliz-ability of our method.

Result: Reperio-rPPG achieves state-of-the-art performance and proves robust across various motion and illumination settings using benchmark datasets like PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD.

Conclusion: Reperio-rPPG successfully addresses the challenge of modeling intrinsic periodicity, enabling improved rPPG accuracy and robustness. It paves the way for more dependable contactless health monitoring systems.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an emerging contactless physiological sensing technique that leverages subtle color variations in facial videos to estimate vital signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate. This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

*Chang Li,Xingtao Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of polygon matching: disparity discontinuity, scale variation, training requirement, and generalization, which remain underexplored compared to stereo image matching.

Method: The U(PM)$^2$ approach uses (1) segmentation masks via pre-trained models, (2) vectorization to convert masks into polygon structures, and (3) a two-stage matcher for global and local accuracy (bidirectional pyramid with LoFTR and local geometry/multi-feature matching with Hungarian algorithm).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive speed, and satisfactory generalization at low cost, benchmarked on ScanNet and SceneFlow datasets with a new evaluation metric.

Conclusion: U(PM)$^2$ addresses key challenges in polygon matching effectively without requiring any training, offering a low-cost yet high-performing solution.

Abstract: Stereo image matching is a fundamental task in computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing, but there is an almost unexplored field, i.e., polygon matching, which faces the following challenges: disparity discontinuity, scale variation, training requirement, and generalization. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel U(PM)$^2$: low-cost unsupervised polygon matching with pre-trained models by uniting automatically learned and handcrafted features, of which pipeline is as follows: firstly, the detector leverages the pre-trained segment anything model to obtain masks; then, the vectorizer converts the masks to polygons and graphic structure; secondly, the global matcher addresses challenges from global viewpoint changes and scale variation based on bidirectional-pyramid strategy with pre-trained LoFTR; finally, the local matcher further overcomes local disparity discontinuity and topology inconsistency of polygon matching by local-joint geometry and multi-feature matching strategy with Hungarian algorithm. We benchmark our U(PM)$^2$ on the ScanNet and SceneFlow datasets using our proposed new metric, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy at a competitive speed and satisfactory generalization performance at low cost without any training requirement.

*Zhixin Cheng,Xiaotian Yin,Jiacheng Deng,Bohao Liao,Yujia Chen,Xu Zhou,Baoqun Yin,Tianzhu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new cross-modal registration approach to address issues with noise and feature selection in image-to-point cloud registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in image-to-point cloud registration, such as noisy conditions leading to incorrect correspondences and difficulties in selecting correlated cross-modal representations.

Method: The proposed framework includes two main modules: Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) for feature awareness using phase maps and reinforcement learning, and Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) to guide interactions, reduce mismatches, and enhance robustness.

Result: The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal registration on RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework improves robustness and accuracy in challenging image-to-point cloud registration scenarios, addressing noise issues and better selecting correlated features across modalities.

Abstract: Typical detection-free methods for image-to-point cloud registration leverage transformer-based architectures to aggregate cross-modal features and establish correspondences. However, they often struggle under challenging conditions, where noise disrupts similarity computation and leads to incorrect correspondences. Moreover, without dedicated designs, it remains difficult to effectively select informative and correlated representations across modalities, thereby limiting the robustness and accuracy of registration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an unsupervised few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection method, 'CIF,' which leverages hypergraphs to capture common structural features from limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of sufficient training samples in few-shot settings means that the diverse patterns of test samples are often not covered. This paper aims to address this gap by extracting structural commonality from the few training examples available.

Method: The approach uses hypergraphs to model higher-order correlations, extracting common structures to build a memory bank. A semantic-aware hypergraph construction module, a training-free hypergraph message passing module, and a hyperedge-guided memory search module are used to enhance anomaly detection.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies datasets in few-shot anomaly detection settings.

Conclusion: By leveraging intra-class structural commonality through hypergraphs and innovative modules, the method improves anomaly detection performance, reducing false positives in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection is a critical yet underexplored task, offering the ability to quickly adapt to complex industrial scenarios. In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study assesses the use of an AI model, MST, in quickly identifying non-significant breast MRI findings, demonstrating promising specificity at high sensitivity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce interpretation workload of high-sensitivity MRI scans for breast cancer detection using AI-assisted pre-screening.

Method: Retrospective analysis of 1,847 single-breast internal MRIs and 924 external validation scans using various abbreviated imaging protocols and MST performance metrics evaluation.

Result: MST showed an AUC of 0.77 for certain imaging combinations, with specificity up to 19% at high sensitivity levels while mainly missing small non-mass enhancements.

Conclusion: The MST framework effectively triaged benign cases in breast MRIs with encouraging specificity, though further validation is needed before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity for breast cancer detection, but interpretation is time-consuming. Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in perception systems for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, DNNs remain vulnerable to various safety concerns, including generalization errors, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, and adversarial attacks, which can lead to hazardous failures. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of runtime safety monitoring approaches, which operate in parallel to DNNs during inference to detect these safety concerns without modifying the DNN itself. We categorize existing methods into three main groups: Monitoring inputs, internal representations, and outputs. We analyze the state-of-the-art for each category, identify strengths and limitations, and map methods to the safety concerns they address. In addition, we highlight open challenges and future research directions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiA-gnostic VLVAE, a model designed to improve radiology report generation by addressing missing modalities and feature entanglement issues using disentangled alignment through a variational autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated methods for radiology reporting face challenges such as incomplete clinical context and mixed modality-specific information, leading to inaccurate and clinically unfaithful results.

Method: The proposed DiA-gnostic VLVAE employs disentangled alignment with a Mixture-of-Experts-based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder, enforcing orthogonality between latent representations and using a compact LLaMA-X decoder for report generation.

Result: DiA demonstrates robust performance on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, achieving competitive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively, and outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The framework is effective in generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports, offering robustness against missing modalities and addressing feature entanglement through innovative disentangling methods.

Abstract: The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a conditional Denoising Diffusion Model combining UNet and Vision Transformer to improve lesion segmentation in ultrasound images, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low contrast, speckle noise, and unclear boundaries in breast ultrasound images hinder precise lesion segmentation, necessary for early diagnosis.

Method: The novel model integrates an advanced UNet-based decoder with a Vision Transformer encoder and introduces innovations like an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge, Topological Denoising Consistency loss, and a dual-head architecture.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 0.96, 0.90, and 0.97 on various public breast ultrasound datasets, showing better segmentation accuracy and anatomical plausibility.

Conclusion: The framework enhances lesion segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and demonstrating the importance of its components through extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: In breast ultrasound images, precise lesion segmentation is essential for early diagnosis; however, low contrast, speckle noise, and unclear boundaries make this difficult. Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.

Motivation: Articulated objects pose tracking is important for robotics but underexplored due to their kinematic constraints compared to rigid objects.

Result: PPF-Tracker shows strong generalization and robustness across synthetic and real-world datasets for articulated object tracking.

Conclusion: The framework enables effective multi-frame pose tracking, fostering advancements in robotics and augmented reality domains.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. Codes are available at https://github.com/mengxh20/PPFTracker.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in generating complex compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes in text-to-image models, such as unintended subject placement, image artifacts, and attribute leakage.

Method: MALeR introduces a mechanism that prevents subjects from appearing outside of user-defined layouts, keeps generated images in distribution, and employs a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism to avoid attribute leakage.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and effective attribute binding compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: MALeR enables accurate and controlled text-to-image generation for complex scenes, particularly specializing in scenarios with multiple subjects and attributes.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have enabled a new era of creative and controllable image generation. However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work. MALeR is particularly adept at generating images of scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances accuracy in LiDAR-camera calibration, reducing errors and enabling robust performance across various scenarios. The code will also be made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Circular targets are widely used in LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration due to their geometric consistency and ease of detection. However, achieving accurate 3D-2D circular center correspondence remains challenging. Existing methods often fail due to decoupled 3D fitting and erroneous 2D ellipse-center estimation. To address this, we propose a geometrically principled framework featuring two innovations: (i) a robust 3D circle center estimator based on conformal geometric algebra and RANSAC; and (ii) a chord-length variance minimization method to recover the true 2D projected center, resolving its dual-minima ambi- guity via homography validation or a quasi-RANSAC fallback. Evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. It reduces extrinsic estimation error and enables robust calibration across diverse sensors and target types, including natural circular objects. Our code will be publicly released for reproducibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and address how VLMs perpetuate social biases in reasoning that adversely affect their downstream performance.

Method: This study analyzes five open-source Vision Language Models on occupation prediction tasks using FairFace dataset, across 32 occupations and three prompting styles, to elicit predictions and reasoning.

Result: The findings reveal systematic biased reasoning patterns in VLMs, producing intersectional disparities in outputs.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the need to align VLM reasoning with human values to mitigate biases and improve performance in downstream applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed across downstream tasks, yet their training data often encode social biases that surface in outputs. Unlike humans, who interpret images through contextual and social cues, VLMs process them through statistical associations, often leading to reasoning that diverges from human reasoning. By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance. To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning. Our findings reveal that the biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities, highlighting the need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to its downstream deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces PanoNav, a novel RGB-only framework for zero-shot object navigation without maps, utilizing spatial reasoning and memory mechanisms to improve navigation in unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Household robots struggle with zero-shot object navigation in unseen environments due to challenges in perceptual understanding and decision-making, often relying on sensors or pre-built maps that limit reasoning. Addressing these limitations can improve spatial reasoning and context-awareness.

Method: PanoNav integrates a panoramic scene parsing module to leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with panoramic RGB inputs and employs a memory-guided decision-making mechanism using a dynamic memory queue to manage navigation history and avoid local deadlocks.

Result: Experiments on a public navigation benchmark demonstrate that PanoNav achieves superior performance in success rate (SR) and success rate weighted by path length (SPL) compared to existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: PanoNav advances the capabilities of zero-shot object navigation without relying on depth sensors or maps, offering improved spatial reasoning and memory-guided decision-making processes for household robots.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unseen environments remains a challenging problem for household robots, requiring strong perceptual understanding and decision-making capabilities. While recent methods leverage metric maps and Large Language Models (LLMs), they often depend on depth sensors or prebuilt maps, limiting the spatial reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Mapless ZSON approaches have emerged to address this, but they typically make short-sighted decisions, leading to local deadlocks due to a lack of historical context. We propose PanoNav, a fully RGB-only, mapless ZSON framework that integrates a Panoramic Scene Parsing module to unlock the spatial parsing potential of MLLMs from panoramic RGB inputs, and a Memory-guided Decision-Making mechanism enhanced by a Dynamic Bounded Memory Queue to incorporate exploration history and avoid local deadlocks. Experiments on the public navigation benchmark show that PanoNav significantly outperforms representative baselines in both SR and SPL metrics.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges of image stitching for UAVs caused by errors in feature detection and matching in feature-based algorithms, specifically in cases of large displacements, rotations, and camera pose variations.

Method: The paper proposes a hybrid method combining IMU data and computer vision. The process includes estimating UAV displacement and rotation, correcting perspective distortion, and calculating a homography matrix. A standard image stitching algorithm is then employed for alignment and blending.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves accuracy and reliability over traditional feature-based image stitching algorithms, particularly in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques improves image stitching for UAV applications, offering a robust and easily integrable solution for real-world challenges.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.

Abstract: Edge computing in person re-identification (ReID) is crucial for reducing the load on central cloud servers and ensuring user privacy. Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation. OSKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods, with the added advantage of one-time knowledge transfer that eliminates the need for frequent computations for each target model.

*Priyansh Srivastava,Romit Chatterjee,Abir Sen,Aradhana Behura,Ratnakar Dash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiVID is a self-supervised video frame interpolation framework using diffusion priors without requiring dense ground-truth. It achieves competitive results with low-resource needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video interpolation faces challenges like occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion, which current methods struggle with. This paper addresses these limitations with a self-supervised approach.

Method: MiVID employs a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style attention under a hybrid masking regime to simulate motion uncertainty and occlusions. It uses cosine-based masking and adaptive loss scheduling.

Result: The framework is tested on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets, achieving competitive results with just 50 epochs of CPU-based training on low-resource setups.

Conclusion: The paper validates the scalability of self-supervised diffusion for temporally coherent frame synthesis, demonstrating its effectiveness and accessibility for VFI systems.

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) remains a cornerstone in video enhancement, enabling temporal upscaling for tasks like slow-motion rendering, frame rate conversion, and video restoration. While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised baselines.This work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.

TL;DR: FLASH is a high-performing LiDAR super-resolution framework that integrates frequency-domain processing and adaptive feature fusion to achieve state-of-the-art results, emphasizing real-time deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of obtaining high-quality 3D perception from cost-effective, low-resolution LiDAR sensors, while overcoming the limitations of existing transformer-based methods like TULIP.

Method: FLASH employs dual-domain processing with two core features: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention combining spatial and frequency-domain analysis using FFT, and (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion with learned position-specific feature aggregation and CBAM attention.

Result: FLASH outperforms state-of-the-art methods including uncertainty-based approaches, achieving better performance across all distance ranges and metrics, validated on KITTI dataset.

Conclusion: The dual-domain approach of FLASH provides an efficient and practical solution for LiDAR super-resolution, demonstrating robust performance and real-time capability for autonomous systems.

Abstract: LiDAR super-resolution addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality 3D perception from cost-effective, low-resolution sensors. While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment. The consistent superiority across all distance ranges validates that our dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.

### [254] [Towards Implicit Aggregation: Robust Image Representation for Place Recognition in the Transformer Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06024)
*Feng Lu,Tong Jin,Canming Ye,Yunpeng Liu,Xiangyuan Lan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for Visual Place Recognition (VPR) by eliminating the need for a dedicated aggregator in transformer models, instead using learnable aggregation tokens in the backbone to create robust global descriptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm in Visual Place Recognition and simplify the process by leveraging the inherent global interaction capability of transformers.

Method: Introduce learnable aggregation tokens to transformer models, which are prepended to patch tokens. These tokens interact globally through the transformer's self-attention mechanism. Optimal placement and initialization strategies for these tokens are also proposed for improved performance.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art VPR approaches on various datasets, demonstrates higher efficiency, and ranks first on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: Implicit aggregation using learnable tokens in transformer models provides a simple yet robust alternative to traditional aggregation techniques, advancing both performance and efficiency in VPR tasks.

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI systems for surgical environments require high-fidelity, controllable simulations due to the limitations in safe interaction within real operating rooms.

Method: The TwinOR framework combines static geometry reconstruction from pre-scan videos with dynamic motion modeling using multi-view perception, fusing them into an immersive 3D environment.

Result: TwinOR reconstructs operating room geometry with centimeter-level accuracy and realistically simulates human-equipment interactions. AI models trained on TwinOR show real-world comparable performance.

Conclusion: TwinOR enables scalable, safe, and efficient development of embodied AI systems, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world deployment in surgical settings.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI for intelligent surgical systems requires safe, controllable environments for continual learning and evaluation. However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs static geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and equipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and dynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports controllable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework reconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while preserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic renderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our experiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry understanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo and ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their reported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides sensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By establishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic digital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and data-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately accelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real.

*Zihui Zhao,Yifei Zhang,Zheng Wang,Yang Li,Kui Jiang,Zihan Geng,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Raw depth images from RGB-D cameras often suffer from artifacts and incomplete depth values. This paper introduces a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) that combines spatial and frequency domains for better depth completion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth images capture by RGB-D cameras often contain artifacts, weak reflections, and incomplete values, limiting their use in vision tasks. Current solutions overlook key physical properties; hence, there's a need for a more effective method.

Method: The paper introduces S2ML, which fuses spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. They utilize phase and amplitude spectra properties combined with unified embedding spaces to harmonize features for better results.

Result: The proposed S2ML framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CFormer on two datasets: NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D, improving by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB respectively.

Conclusion: By leveraging complementary physical characteristics in spatial and frequency domains, S2ML achieves improved depth completion performance, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Abstract: The raw depth images captured by RGB-D cameras using Time-of-Flight (TOF) or structured light often suffer from incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which limit their applications in downstream vision tasks. Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed S2ML method, outperforming the state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreamSTGS, a novel FVV representation aimed at enabling real-time streaming by optimizing compression techniques using 3D Gaussian Splatting. It achieves high performance with smaller storage requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of high storage requirements in 3DGS-based FVV methods, which impede real-time streaming despite their remarkable training and rendering efficiencies.

Method: StreamSTGS combines canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. It encodes Gaussian attributes and temporal features as 2D images and videos respectively, employing a sliding window scheme for local motion learning and a transformer-guided module for global motion training.

Result: StreamSTGS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by an average of 1dB while reducing average frame size to 170KB.

Conclusion: StreamSTGS overcomes critical challenges of real-time FVV streaming with efficient compression and adaptive bitrate control, showing promising results and practical applicability.

Abstract: Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS.

Motivation: The goal is to enable mobile-friendly, on-device text-to-video synthesis without relying on expensive cloud services, making AI-assisted video creation accessible and private.

Method: The system incorporates four technical innovations: text-encoder distillation, asymmetric decoder distillation, MMDiT block optimization via pruning, and reduction of Neural Functional Evaluation steps through step distillation. Additionally, it utilizes an optimized first-frame image generator and super-resolution network for mobile efficiency.

Result: Neodragon achieves high efficiency with a VBench total score of 81.61, utilizing minimal computational resources (3.5GB RAM) and low latency (6.7 seconds) to produce high-quality 640x1024 resolution videos.

Conclusion: Neodragon democratizes text-to-video synthesis by delivering high-quality, efficient, and accessible video generation directly on mobile devices, eliminating dependency on cloud-based solutions.

Abstract: We introduce Neodragon, a text-to-video system capable of generating 2s (49 frames @24 fps) videos at the 640x1024 resolution directly on a Qualcomm Hexagon NPU in a record 6.7s (7 FPS). Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

TL;DR: This paper presents LoopExpose, an unsupervised method for exposure correction using pseudo-labels and a nested loop optimization strategy, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods for exposure correction require large labeled datasets, which are impractical to obtain, creating a need for an unsupervised solution.

Method: LoopExpose uses a pseudo-label approach with a nested loop optimization. The upper level trains a correction model with pseudo-labels from multi-exposure fusion in the lower level, incorporating a feedback loop and self-supervised Luminance Ranking Loss.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LoopExpose provides superior exposure correction and fusion performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: By leveraging pseudo-labeling and self-reinforcement in exposure correction with luminance calibration, LoopExpose offers a promising unsupervised solution for image enhancement under diverse lighting conditions.

Abstract: Exposure correction is essential for enhancing image quality under challenging lighting conditions. While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

Motivation: Motion blur impairs scene-text readability, affecting tasks such as autonomous driving and document digitization. Conventional methods fail to address spatially varying blur and long-range dependencies effectively.

Method: The hybrid framework combines CNNs for local feature extraction with ViTs for global contextual reasoning. A curated dataset from TextOCR is used, synergizing sharp text samples with blurry ones created using motion-blur kernels. Composite loss optimizes training.

Result: The model achieves 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, demonstrating enhanced performance. It is computationally efficient with 2.83 million parameters and a 61 ms inference time.

Conclusion: The CNN-ViT framework successfully restores motion-blurred scene-text images. Its computational efficiency establishes practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: Motion blur in scene text images severely impairs readability and hinders the reliability of computer vision tasks, including autonomous driving, document digitization, and visual information retrieval. Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LFlow, a training-free framework utilizing latent flow priors for linear inverse problem solving. LFlow employs efficient ODE sampling in latent spaces, offering improved computational performance and reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse problem solving is hindered by the high computational demands of pixel-space flow-based methods and the guidance strategies that compromise alignment and posterior coverage.

Method: LFlow utilizes pretrained latent flow priors for training-free inverse problem solving. It performs ODE sampling in latent spaces and introduces a theoretically grounded posterior covariance derived from the optimal vector field.

Result: Experimental analysis shows LFlow surpassing existing latent diffusion models in reconstruction quality across various tasks.

Conclusion: LFlow enhances the efficiency and quality of solving inverse problems by leveraging latent flow priors, offering scalable and computationally effective solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in inverse problem solving have increasingly adopted flow priors over diffusion models due to their ability to construct straight probability paths from noise to data, thereby enhancing efficiency in both training and inference. However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers in reconstruction quality across most tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time geospatial information processing for UAVs is critical in situations like disaster response, but challenges arise due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution imagery.

Method: The framework segments UAV images into patches, tracks them using GNSS/IMU data, and performs localized bundle adjustment using overlapping relationships derived from real-time UAV navigation data.

Result: The method successfully processes UAV imagery for precise mapping and camera calibration in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration, validated on datasets with 50MP images.

Conclusion: The framework enables lightweight, onboard-compatible real-time imagery processing with high fidelity for applications such as disaster response and infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: Real-time processing of UAV imagery is crucial for applications requiring urgent geospatial information, such as disaster response, where rapid decision-making and accurate spatial data are essential. However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.

Method: The authors created a COVC dataset and developed the MambaOVSR model, incorporating GFM for motion modeling, MSMM for alignment across sequences, and MambaVR block for resolving feature artifacts and positional loss.

Result: MambaOVSR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming SOTA methods by an average of 1.86 dB PSNR on the COVC dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed MambaOVSR approach and dataset effectively address challenges in restoring degraded Chinese opera videos, showcasing significant improvements in quality. The dataset and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Chinese opera is celebrated for preserving classical art. However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR. Dataset and Code will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of creating editable 3D CAD models from text, bypassing limitations of mesh-based systems or requiring scarce design-history data.

Method: The method includes fine-tuning a large language model to convert text into JSON encoding NURBS parameters, leveraging hybrid representation combining NURBS with analytic primitives, and curating a captioned dataset for validation.

Result: NURBGen achieves high performance in generating geometric precision and dimensional accuracy from diverse text prompts compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: The framework significantly advances text-to-CAD generation technology with expert-confirmed fidelity and robustness, supporting its utility and future accessibility via public code and dataset release.

Abstract: Generating editable 3D CAD models from natural language remains challenging, as existing text-to-CAD systems either produce meshes or rely on scarce design-history data. We present NURBGen, the first framework to generate high-fidelity 3D CAD models directly from text using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). To achieve this, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to translate free-form texts into JSON representations containing NURBS surface parameters (\textit{i.e}, control points, knot vectors, degrees, and rational weights) which can be directly converted into BRep format using Python. We further propose a hybrid representation that combines untrimmed NURBS with analytic primitives to handle trimmed surfaces and degenerate regions more robustly, while reducing token complexity. Additionally, we introduce partABC, a curated subset of the ABC dataset consisting of individual CAD components, annotated with detailed captions using an automated annotation pipeline. NURBGen demonstrates strong performance on diverse prompts, surpassing prior methods in geometric fidelity and dimensional accuracy, as confirmed by expert evaluations. Code and dataset will be released publicly.

Motivation: To democratize urban design by empowering local participation and moving away from centralized, top-down planning.

Method: A human-in-the-loop framework uses Grounding DINO with ADE20K dataset for object detection, co-occurrence embeddings for spatial analysis, and a vision language model for proposing urban design patterns.

Result: The system provides five statistically likely complements to an anchor object and proposes a third object for complex urban tactics, enabling optimized urban interventions.

Abstract: This paper introduces a human-in-the-loop computer vision framework that uses generative AI to propose micro-scale design interventions in public space and support more continuous, local participation. Using Grounding DINO and a curated subset of the ADE20K dataset as a proxy for the urban built environment, the system detects urban objects and builds co-occurrence embeddings that reveal common spatial configurations. From this analysis, the user receives five statistically likely complements to a chosen anchor object. A vision language model then reasons over the scene image and the selected pair to suggest a third object that completes a more complex urban tactic. The workflow keeps people in control of selection and refinement and aims to move beyond top-down master planning by grounding choices in everyday patterns and lived experience.

*Shu Zhao,Nilesh Ahuja,Tan Yu,Tianyi Shen,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRA is a fine-tuning method aimed at improving multimodal recognition under missing-modality scenarios, ensuring efficient training with low computation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of real-world scenarios where multimodal inputs are incomplete, due to reasons such as privacy and resource limitations.

Method: The proposed method, MoRA, introduces modality-specific and modality-common parameters for vision-language models to enhance cross-modal interactions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: MoRA improves performance in missing-modality tasks by 5.24%, significantly reduces inference time (by 74.10%), and requires minimal trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MoRA offers a practical solution for modality-missing scenarios, delivering optimal performance and efficiency while minimizing computational overhead.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models have shown remarkable performance on visual recognition tasks, but they typically assume the availability of complete multimodal inputs during both training and inference. In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer. Additionally, combined with the modality-specific parameters, MoRA allows the backbone model to maintain inter-modality interaction and enable intra-modality flexibility. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MoRA achieves an average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios by 5.24% and uses only 25.90% of the inference time compared to the SOTA method while requiring only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras excel in challenging environments where traditional cameras struggle, but processing their asynchronous outputs remains difficult. The authors aim to leverage powerful pretrained Visual Foundation Models for improving event-based vision by facilitating temporal reasoning.

Method: The proposed TGVFM framework integrates VFMs with a novel temporal context fusion block that includes long-range temporal attention, dual spatiotemporal attention, and deep feature guidance for semantic-temporal feature fusion.

Result: When applied to event-to-video models, TGVFM achieves superior performance, improving segmentation by 16%, depth estimation by 21%, and object detection by 16%, surpassing previous methods.

Conclusion: TGVFM exploits pretrained image-based VFMs to address asynchronous event stream processing issues, unlocking their cross-modality potential for event-based vision tasks with temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for vision tasks in challenging environments, yet processing asynchronous event streams remains an open challenge. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap. Our temporal block introduces three key components: (1) Long-Range Temporal Attention to model global temporal dependencies, (2) Dual Spatiotemporal Attention for multi-scale frame correlation, and (3) Deep Feature Guidance Mechanism to fuse semantic-temporal features. By retraining event-to-video models on real-world data and leveraging transformer-based VFMs, TGVFM preserves spatiotemporal dynamics while harnessing pretrained representations. Experiments demonstrate SoTA performance across semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object detection, with improvements of 16%, 21%, and 16% over existing methods, respectively. Overall, this work unlocks the cross-modality potential of image-based VFMs for event-based vision with temporal reasoning. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaRho/TGVFM.

TL;DR: Motion blur affects image quality and downstream vision tasks. This paper introduces physics-informed PDE dynamics into restoration architectures to improve motion deblurring with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur fundamentally degrades image quality and presents challenges for vision tasks. Existing methods lack effective modeling of long-range spatial dependencies, creating the need for incorporating physical priors for better restoration.

Method: The paper proposes a progressive training framework that integrates advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution alongside state-of-the-art restoration architectures.

Result: The proposed framework enhances restoration quality while minimally increasing computation load, achieving significant improvements in PSNR and SSIM across diverse architectures.

Conclusion: Physics-informed layers leveraging PDE improve motion deblurring and establish a strong approach to incorporate mathematical physics for image restoration within computer vision.

Abstract: Motion blur, caused by relative movement between camera and scene during exposure, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition in dynamic environments. While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CoD$^2$, a novel framework integrating diffusion and discriminative models, for robust gait recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results across four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models in gait recognition remain unexplored, despite the success of discriminative approaches in using walking patterns for biometric identification.

Method: CoD$^2$ combines data distribution modeling (diffusion models) and semantic representation learning (discriminative models), using a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy for high-level identity conditions and low-level visual detail preservation.

Result: CoD$^2$ outperforms the current methods on SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D datasets, demonstrating improved gait recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates generative and discriminative models, advancing gait recognition with significant performance improvement and compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Gait recognition offers a non-intrusive biometric solution by identifying individuals through their walking patterns. Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on four datasets (SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D) demonstrate that CoD$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing discriminative methods, yielding consistent improvements.

Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiencies of current methods for using LLMs in autonomous driving, which activate LLMs too frequently or follow fixed schedules, both leading to performance and computational challenges.

Method: AdaDrive combines an adaptive activation loss mechanism to determine when LLMs are needed, with an adaptive fusion strategy to modulate their contribution based on scene complexity and prediction confidence.

Conclusion: AdaDrive offers a context-aware system that effectively integrates LLMs into autonomous driving, optimizing their usage and improving overall system performance. The code is also publicly available for broader use and verification.

Abstract: Effectively integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving requires a balance between leveraging high-level reasoning and maintaining real-time efficiency. Existing approaches either activate LLMs too frequently, causing excessive computational overhead, or use fixed schedules, failing to adapt to dynamic driving conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners. Through these strategies, AdaDrive provides a flexible, context-aware framework that maximizes decision accuracy without compromising real-time performance. Extensive experiments on language-grounded autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that AdaDrive state-of-the-art performance in terms of both driving accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to nearest-neighbour retrieval using targeted perturbations rather than traditional geometric distance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nearest-neighbour retrieval is vital for classification and explainable AI but is hindered by reliance on hand-tuned features and metrics.

Method: The proposed TMM-NN utilizes a query-specific trigger patch to perturb the query input, steering similar samples to a dummy class for semantic ranking.

Result: The trigger-based ranking demonstrated improved retrieval performance under noise and across diverse tasks compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: This work reconceptualizes nearest-neighbour retrieval, offering a more robust and semantically meaningful solution through targeted perturbations.

Abstract: Nearest-neighbour retrieval is central to classification and explainable-AI pipelines, but current practice relies on hand-tuning feature layers and distance metrics. We propose Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN), which reconceptualises retrieval by assessing how readily each sample can be nudged into a designated region of the feature manifold; neighbourhoods are defined by a sample's responsiveness to a targeted perturbation rather than absolute geometric distance. TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours. Robustness analysis and benchmark experiments confirm this trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional metrics under noise and across diverse tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal retrieval in cultural heritage data is hindered by incomplete and inconsistent textual descriptions due to historical data limitations and annotation costs.

Method: The $C^3$ framework uses a completeness evaluation module based on visual cues and language outputs, and factual inconsistency is tackled using a Markov Decision Process for supervised Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Result: Experiments show that $C^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on cultural heritage datasets (CulTi and TimeTravel) and general benchmarks (MSCOCO, Flickr30K) in fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: $C^3$ effectively improves cross-modal retrieval, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of enriched textual descriptions using specialized evaluation approaches.

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is essential for interpreting cultural heritage data, but its effectiveness is often limited by incomplete or inconsistent textual descriptions, caused by historical data loss and the high cost of expert annotation. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enriching textual descriptions, their outputs frequently suffer from hallucinations or miss visually grounded details. To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control. Experiments on the cultural heritage datasets CulTi and TimeTravel, as well as on general benchmarks MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that $C^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RelightMaster, a framework for precise video relighting using a novel dataset and advanced lighting modeling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently no solution for precise video relighting in high-quality video generation and editing due to a lack of fine-grained lighting control and the difficulty in constructing lighting-related training data.

Method: The authors propose RelightMaster, utilizing a new dataset (RelightVideo) with identical scenes under varied lighting, a visual prompt (MPLI) for modeling 3D lighting, and a Light Image Adapter to inject lighting features into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers.

Result: RelightMaster generates videos with realistic lighting and shadows while maintaining the original content consistency.

Conclusion: RelightMaster addresses the challenges of video relighting and provides a practical framework for precise, controllable, and physically plausible lighting in videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models enable high-quality video generation and editing, but precise relighting with consistent video contents, which is critical for shaping scene atmosphere and viewer attention, remains unexplored. Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows and preserves original scene content. Demos are available at https://wkbian.github.io/Projects/RelightMaster/.

TL;DR: LaneDiffusion uses diffusion models and novel modules to generate lane centerline priors for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art results based on fine-grained and segment-level metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deterministic methods for learning centerline graphs struggle with spatial reasoning and occluded centerlines. Generative approaches, though promising, are underexplored, motivating the introduction of LaneDiffusion.

Method: LaneDiffusion employs diffusion models to produce lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View feature in combination with the Lane Prior Injection Module and Lane Prior Diffusion Module. These priors are decoded into vectorized centerlines.

Result: LaneDiffusion improves fine-grained point-level metrics (4.2%–6.4% improvement) and segment-level metrics (2.1%–6.8% improvement) over prior methods on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, establishing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: LaneDiffusion highlights the potential for generative models in centerline graph learning, providing superior results and new insights in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Centerline graphs, crucial for path planning in autonomous driving, are traditionally learned using deterministic methods. However, these methods often lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded or invisible centerlines. Generative approaches, despite their potential, remain underexplored in this domain. We introduce LaneDiffusion, a novel generative paradigm for centerline graph learning. LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process. Furthermore, vectorized centerlines and topologies are then decoded from these prior-injected BEV features. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that LaneDiffusion significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving improvements of 4.2%, 4.6%, 4.7%, 6.4% and 1.8% on fine-grained point-level metrics (GEO F1, TOPO F1, JTOPO F1, APLS and SDA) and 2.3%, 6.4%, 6.8% and 2.1% on segment-level metrics (IoU, mAP_cf, DET_l and TOP_ll). These results establish state-of-the-art performance in centerline graph learning, offering new insights into generative models for this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of MLLMs surpasses current video datasets, while manual data labeling is expensive. The paper seeks to leverage intrinsic video information to self-generate high-quality training data.

Method: Three self-supervised pretext tasks are introduced: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. A dataset (VideoSSR-30K) and framework (VideoSSR) are developed to train models and test performance on various benchmarks.

Result: VideoSSR leads to consistent performance improvement across 17 benchmarks in four video domains, with an average improvement of over 5%.

Conclusion: VideoSSR is an effective framework for advancing video understanding capabilities in MLLMs, providing a foundation for improved performance and further research.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially advanced the video understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the rapid progress of MLLMs is outpacing the complexity of existing video datasets, while the manual annotation of new, high-quality data remains prohibitively expensive. This work investigates a pivotal question: Can the rich, intrinsic information within videos be harnessed to self-generate high-quality, verifiable training data? To investigate this, we introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. We construct the Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench) to validate their difficulty, revealing that current state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly on these tasks. Building upon these pretext tasks, we develop the VideoSSR-30K dataset and propose VideoSSR, a novel video self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks, spanning four major video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, and Complex Reasoning), demonstrate that VideoSSR consistently enhances model performance, yielding an average improvement of over 5\%. These results establish VideoSSR as a potent foundational framework for developing more advanced video understanding in MLLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/lcqysl/VideoSSR.

TL;DR: This study evaluates radiologist interpretation using O-RADS v2022 and compares it to CNN and ViT deep learning models for adnexal lesion characterization, finding that AI outperforms radiologists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the variability and limitations of human interpretation in adnexal lesion risk assessment using O-RADS, and the emerging potential of deep learning models in addressing these challenges.

Method: The study utilized 16 DL models (various CNNs and ViTs) trained and validated on 512 images. A hybrid model combining DL predictions with radiologist O-RADS scores was also developed.

Result: Radiologists' O-RADS achieved 68.0% accuracy (AUC 0.683). CNN models had 59.2%-86.4% accuracy (AUCs 0.620-0.908) and ViT16-384 achieved the highest performance at 87.4% accuracy (AUC 0.941). Hybrid models further improved results for CNN-based schemes, but not significantly for ViTs.

Conclusion: Deep learning models surpass radiologists in accuracy for adnexal lesion classification, and hybrid human-AI methods can enhance diagnostic performance, streamlining ultrasound interpretation and improving high-risk lesion detection.

Abstract: Background: The 2022 update of the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound classification refines risk stratification for adnexal lesions, yet human interpretation remains subject to variability and conservative thresholds. Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation, reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions.

*Xuanle Zhao,Shuxin Zeng,Yinyuan Cai,Xiang Cheng,Duzhen Zhang,Xiuyi Chen,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyChemVL enhances performance in chemical vision-language tasks, offering efficiency and reasoning capabilities while addressing limitations of existing VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Vision Language Models (VLMs) overlook critical chemical visual information, such as molecular structures, and often lack the ability to efficiently integrate reasoning for chemical tasks.

Method: TinyChemVL introduces visual token reduction and focuses on reaction-level tasks for efficiency and improved reasoning. A benchmark, ChemRxn-V, is also developed for reaction-level visual task evaluation.

Result: TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on molecular and reaction tasks, with faster inference/training speeds, outperforming ChemVLM while using significantly fewer visual tokens.

Conclusion: TinyChemVL and ChemRxn-V establish new standards for efficient and robust chemical visual-language modeling, advancing task complexity and improving reasoning in chemical domains.

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in general visual understanding, their application in the chemical domain has been limited, with previous works predominantly focusing on text and thus overlooking critical visual information, such as molecular structures. Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens. This work builds efficient yet powerful VLMs for chemical domains by co-designing model architecture and task complexity.

*Bing Wang,Ximing Li,Yanjun Wang,Changchun Li,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Buyu Wang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RETSIMD is a new multimodal misinformation detection method where text is split into segments, augmented with generated images, and processed with a graph neural network for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance multimodal misinformation detection by addressing the imbalance in contributions from text and image modalities, emphasizing that text often contains more comprehensive information than images.

Method: Proposes RETSIMD, splitting the text into segments and generating images using a pre-trained text-to-image generator. Incorporates auxiliary objectives for mutual information and uses a graph neural network to analyze relationships between images.

Result: Extensive empirical results demonstrate that RETSIMD effectively improves misinformation detection in social media posts.

Conclusion: The approach of augmenting text-based information with generated images and leveraging graph structures provides an effective method for multimodal misinformation detection and highlights the greater informativeness of the text modality.

Abstract: Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) refers to the task of detecting social media posts involving misinformation, where the post often contains text and image modalities. However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.

*Xin Zuo,Yuchen Qu,Haibo Zhan,Jifeng Shen,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method (SFFR) for advancing UAV multispectral object detection by utilizing spatial-frequency features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored potential of frequency-domain features in multispectral object detection and improve feature fusion for UAV applications.

Method: Introducing an SFFR method with two innovative modules: Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) for frequency-based feature enhancement and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) for nonlinear spatial feature modeling.

Result: Experimentally validated superior performance and robustness on multispectral datasets (SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle, DVTOD), demonstrating improved adaptability for scale variations at different UAV flight altitudes.

Conclusion: The SFFR method successfully captures both spatial and frequency semantic features, offering superior adaptability and robustness for UAV multispectral object detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent multispectral object detection methods have primarily focused on spatial-domain feature fusion based on CNNs or Transformers, while the potential of frequency-domain feature remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

*Haoqin Hong,Ding Fan,Fubin Dou,Zhi-Li Zhou,Haoran Sun,Congcong Zhu,Jingrun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new approach called Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG) for improving dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular video input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely data-driven techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting often fail to capture physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes.

Method: The method involves treating Gaussian particles as Lagrangian material points and supervising motion via 2D optical flow projection. It uses static-dynamic decoupled hash encoding and imposes the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement in physical consistency and dynamic reconstruction quality across synthetic, real-world, and custom physics-driven datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating physics constraints enhances the capabilities of 3DGS, achieving better motion reconstruction and generalization in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an explicit scene representation technique, has shown significant promise for dynamic novel-view synthesis from monocular video input. However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.

### [286] [Adaptive 3D Reconstruction via Diffusion Priors and Forward Curvature-Matching Likelihood Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06310)
*Seunghyeok Shin,Dabin Kim,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) method for reconstructing high-quality point clouds, addressing issues in flexibility and optimization in existing diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-quality point cloud reconstruction techniques face limitations such as the need for conditioning signals during training, supporting only fixed input views, and requiring retraining for different measurements.

Method: The paper introduces the FCM update method which dynamically determines optimal step sizes for likelihood updates using forward automatic differentiation and curvature estimates, integrated with diffusion sampling.

Result: Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets show superior reconstruction quality with higher F-scores, lower CD and EMD metrics, proving efficiency and adaptability compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FCM method improves reconstruction quality at lower or comparable NFEs, supports input flexibility without retraining, and is practical for diverse modalities in computer vision applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality point clouds from images remains challenging in computer vision. Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

### [287] [Seq2Seq Models Reconstruct Visual Jigsaw Puzzles without Seeing Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06315)
*Gur Elkn,Ofir Itzhak Shahar,Ohad Ben-Shahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach where language models solve jigsaw puzzles using tokenized representations instead of visual inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if language models can solve traditionally visual tasks, like jigsaw puzzles, by leveraging tokenized representations and reasoning without visual input.

Method: The authors use a specialized tokenizer to convert puzzle pieces into discrete token sequences, enabling encoder-decoder transformers to reassemble jigsaw puzzles as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task.

Result: Language models successfully reconstruct original puzzle layouts using token sequences alone, often outperforming vision-based methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the capability of language models to solve problems beyond their visual domain and suggests alternative approaches for puzzle-solving research.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzles are primarily visual objects, whose algorithmic solutions have traditionally been framed from a visual perspective. In this work, however, we explore a fundamentally different approach: solving square jigsaw puzzles using language models, without access to raw visual input. By introducing a specialized tokenizer that converts each puzzle piece into a discrete sequence of tokens, we reframe puzzle reassembly as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Treated as "blind" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods. These findings highlight the surprising capability of language models to solve problems beyond their native domain, and suggest that unconventional approaches can inspire promising directions for puzzle-solving research.

*Minsuk Jang,Hyeonseo Jeong,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CINEMAE introduces a novel AIGC image detection method, achieving strong cross-generator generalization using a Masked AutoEncoder for semantic anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based detectors struggle with overfitting specific generator artifacts, while text-based detection methods have shown generalization capabilities.

Method: Using Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), the paper probabilistically measures reconstruction uncertainty using conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and integrates features for global evaluation and detection.

Result: CINEMAE achieves over 95% accuracy in identifying AI-generated images across eight unseen image generators in the GenImage benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Context-based reconstruction uncertainty through MAE provides a transferable and robust approach to detect AI-generated images across diverse generators.

Abstract: While context-based detectors have achieved strong generalization for AI-generated text by measuring distributional inconsistencies, image-based detectors still struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts. We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors. This demonstrates that context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) regarding modality imbalance and redundancy by proposing a dynamic modality selection framework, MODS, which improves performance through adaptive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in MSA where imbalanced modality performance and redundancy in non-language modalities negatively affect sentiment prediction, aiming to create a dynamic and efficient system.

Method: They propose MODS framework that employs a graph-based dynamic sequence compressor (GDC), a sample-adaptive primary modality selector (MSelector), and a cross-attention module (PCCA) for dynamic modality optimization.

Result: MODS demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving better sentiment analysis by balancing modality contributions and reducing redundant noise in non-language data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that dynamic primary modality selection and optimization effectively improve MSA performance by addressing modality imbalance and noise issues, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to predict sentiment from language, acoustic, and visual data in videos. However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance by effectively balancing modality contributions and eliminating redundant noise.

TL;DR: The paper explores strategies for enhanced tree analysis using laser scanning point clouds through self-supervised and transfer learning, aiming to refine precision forestry while minimizing dataset dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve individual tree analysis for precision forestry, biodiversity conservation, and biomass mapping by addressing challenges in annotating laser scanning point clouds.

Method: The study uses self-supervised learning and transfer learning architectures to enhance performance in tree segmentation, semantic identification, and classification.

Result: The work shows significant gains in performance: instance segmentation improved by +16.98%, semantic segmentation by +1.79%, and classification of unseen species by +6.07%. Pretrained models also reduce energy consumption by ~21%.

Conclusion: The unified framework accelerates the extraction of tree data from point clouds, contributing to forestry, biodiversity conservation, and carbon mapping with reduced dependency on annotated datasets.

Abstract: Detailed structural and species information on individual tree level is increasingly important to support precision forestry, biodiversity conservation, and provide reference data for biomass and carbon mapping. Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%. This open-source contribution aims to accelerate operational extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds to support forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping.

Result: BuildingWorld enhances the capability for 3D building reconstruction, detection, and segmentation with its diverse dataset and provides a virtual environment for generating diverse training scenarios.

Conclusion: BuildingWorld addresses architectural diversity limitations to improve urban-scale modeling and provides tools and metrics for advancing research and evaluation in 3D urban environments.

Abstract: As digital twins become central to the transformation of modern cities, accurate and structured 3D building models emerge as a key enabler of high-fidelity, updatable urban representations. These models underpin diverse applications including energy modeling, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and real-time reasoning. Despite recent advances in 3D urban modeling, most learning-based models are trained on building datasets with limited architectural diversity, which significantly undermines their generalizability across heterogeneous urban environments. To address this limitation, we present BuildingWorld, a comprehensive and structured 3D building dataset designed to bridge the gap in stylistic diversity. It encompasses buildings from geographically and architecturally diverse regions -- including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania -- offering a globally representative dataset for urban-scale foundation modeling and analysis. Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions. Furthermore, we provide standardized evaluation metrics tailored for building reconstruction, aiming to facilitate the training, evaluation, and comparison of large-scale vision models and foundation models in structured 3D urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified system for gaze understanding by using both visual and language prompts.

Method: GazeVLM employs visual (RGB and depth) and textual modality fusion, leveraging HHA-encoded depth maps guided by text prompts to achieve multi-task gaze understanding capabilities.

Result: It outperforms previous models, achieving state-of-the-art scores on benchmarks like GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets.

Conclusion: GazeVLM successfully unifies gaze tasks in a Vision-Language framework, showcasing its effectiveness and accuracy.

Abstract: Gaze understanding unifies the detection of people, their gaze targets, and objects of interest into a single framework, offering critical insight into visual attention and intent estimation. Although prior research has modelled gaze cues in visual scenes, a unified system is still needed for gaze understanding using both visual and language prompts. This paper introduces GazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding in images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance. We also introduce an object-level gaze detection metric for gaze object identification ($AP_{ob}$). Through experiments, GazeVLM demonstrates significant improvements, notably achieving state-of-the-art evaluation scores on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing benchmarks for image aesthetic assessment, which are either too narrow in scope or lack diversity to fully evaluate aesthetic capabilities.

Method: The paper proposes AesTest, a benchmark with multiple-choice tasks based on psychological theories, diverse data sources, and varied aesthetic queries, ensuring broad and systematic evaluation.

Result: Evaluation using AesTest shows significant challenges for multimodal large language models in achieving aesthetic intelligence.

Conclusion: AesTest presents an advanced framework for testing multimodal aesthetic perception and production, and its public release aims to drive further research in this domain.

Abstract: Perceiving and producing aesthetic judgments is a fundamental yet underexplored capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for image aesthetic assessment (IAA) are narrow in perception scope or lack the diversity needed to evaluate systematic aesthetic production. To address this gap, we introduce AesTest, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal aesthetic perception and production, distinguished by the following features: 1) It consists of curated multiple-choice questions spanning ten tasks, covering perception, appreciation, creation, and photography. These tasks are grounded in psychological theories of generative learning. 2) It integrates data from diverse sources, including professional editing workflows, photographic composition tutorials, and crowdsourced preferences. It ensures coverage of both expert-level principles and real-world variation. 3) It supports various aesthetic query types, such as attribute-based analysis, emotional resonance, compositional choice, and stylistic reasoning. We evaluate both instruction-tuned IAA MLLMs and general MLLMs on AesTest, revealing significant challenges in building aesthetic intelligence. We will publicly release AesTest to support future research in this area.

*Haojun Tang,Qiwei Lin,Tongda Xu,Lida Huang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposing V-Shuffle as a new zero-shot style transfer method for balancing content preservation and style fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combat content leakage in existing attention injection-based style transfer methods where semantic content of style images affects output.

Method: Uses multiple style images and disrupts style image content via shuffling value features in the self-attention layers, paired with Hybrid Style Regularization.

Result: Empirical results show superior performance using multiple style images and surpassing state-of-the-art methods with a single style image.

Conclusion: V-Shuffle effectively addresses content leakage, achieving improved style transfer performance across varying conditions.

Abstract: Attention injection-based style transfer has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where the undesired semantic content of the style image mistakenly appears in the stylized output. In this paper, we propose V-Shuffle, a zero-shot style transfer method that leverages multiple style images from the same style domain to effectively navigate the trade-off between content preservation and style fidelity. V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations. We further introduce a Hybrid Style Regularization that complements these low-level representations with high-level style textures to enhance style fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that V-Shuffle achieves excellent performance when utilizing multiple style images. Moreover, when applied to a single style image, V-Shuffle outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoAffect, a 3.5k-sample dataset annotated for affective dimensions in infographics, utilizing multimodal large language models and achieving high accuracy validated through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current studies lack exploration of affective dimensions in infographics due to limited data resources.

Method: The researchers created the InfoAffect dataset through preprocessing raw data from diverse domains, quality control techniques, multimodal analysis with large language models, and Reciprocal Rank Fusion algorithm.

Result: User study and experiments achieved high Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI) score of 0.986, validating the dataset's accuracy and usability.

Conclusion: InfoAffect provides a valuable resource for understanding and analyzing affective dimensions within infographics with confirmed reliability.

Abstract: Infographics are widely used to convey complex information, yet their affective dimensions remain underexplored due to the scarcity of data resources. We introduce a 3.5k-sample affect-annotated InfoAffect dataset, which combines textual content with real-world infographics. We first collect the raw data from six domains and aligned them via preprocessing, the accompanied-text-priority method, and three strategies to guarantee the quality and compliance. After that we construct an affect table and use it to constrain annotation. Five state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) then analyze both modalities, and their outputs are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm to yield robust affects and confidences. We conducted a user study with two experiments to validate usability and assess InfoAffect dataset using the Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI), achieving an overall score of 0.986, which indicates high accuracy.

*Shuo Yang,Yinghui Xing,Shizhou Zhang,Zhilong Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Scarf-DETR, a novel detection model for infrared-visible object detection (IVOD) that flexibly handles both complete and incomplete modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of performance decline in IVOD models when facing incomplete data, especially when the dominant modality is missing.

Method: Proposes a Scarf Neck module for DETR-based models with a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism, coupled with a pseudo modality dropout training strategy.

Result: Scarf-DETR demonstrates strong performance under single and dual modality scenarios and outperforms on standard IVOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scarf-DETR addresses modality-incomplete IVOD issues effectively, enhancing both robustness and compatibility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Infrared and visible object detection (IVOD) is essential for numerous around-the-clock applications. Despite notable advancements, current IVOD models exhibit notable performance declines when confronted with incomplete modality data, particularly if the dominant modality is missing. In this paper, we take a thorough investigation on modality incomplete IVOD problem from an architecture compatibility perspective. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Scarf Neck module for DETR variants, which introduces a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to enable the IVOD detector to flexibly adapt to any single or double modalities during training and inference. When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary. Our proposed Scarf-DETR not only performs excellently in missing modality scenarios but also achieves superior performances on the standard IVOD modality complete benchmarks. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YinghuiXing/Scarf-DETR.

### [297] [VDNeRF: Vision-only Dynamic Neural Radiance Field for Urban Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06408)
*Zhengyu Zou,Jingfeng Li,Hao Li,Xiaolei Hou,Jinwen Hu,Jingkun Chen,Lechao Cheng,Dingwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDNeRF is a method proposed to handle dynamic urban scenes using Neural Radiance Fields, without requiring camera pose information, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation and dynamic view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based methods face challenges in autonomous driving and robotic perception due to difficulty in camera pose inference and limitations in dynamic environments.

Method: VDNeRF uses two NeRF models for separate reconstruction of static and dynamic scenes. The static model optimizes camera poses and backgrounds, while the dynamic model incorporates 3D scene flow to model dynamic objects. A special training framework addresses motion ambiguities effectively.

Result: VDNeRF achieves superior performance compared to other pose-free methods in camera pose estimation and synthesis of novel dynamic views.

Conclusion: The method enables effective perception in dynamic urban scenarios, overcoming limitations of prior NeRF-based approaches through robust pose estimation and spatiotemporal scene representation.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) implicitly model continuous three-dimensional scenes using a set of images with known camera poses, enabling the rendering of photorealistic novel views. However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception, primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene. Extensive evaluations on mainstream urban driving datasets demonstrate that VDNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis.

*Tao Liu,Kan Ren,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework for UAVs using diffusion models and VAE, without satellite reliance, to address localization challenges in GNSS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome localization challenges in GNSS-denied environments and close the gap between UAV oblique images and satellite nadir orthophotos without relying on complex architectures or annotated data.

Method: The authors create a cross-view localization method, DiffusionUavLoc, which includes training-free geometric rendering for synthesizing pseudo-satellite images and a text-free conditional diffusion model for robust feature learning.

Result: The method demonstrated competitive performance on University-1652 and SUES-200, particularly for satellite-to-drone localization on University-1652.

Conclusion: DiffusionUavLoc provides a promising, efficient, and novel approach for drone localization in GNSS-denied scenarios by leveraging image prompts and diffusion models, bypassing significant domain gaps and conventional dependencies.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key platforms for measurement and tracking in intelligent patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity. On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method performs competitively for cross-view localization, especially for satellite-to-drone in University-1652.Our data and code will be published at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/DiffusionUavLoc.git.

*Sungrae Hong,Sol Lee,Jisu Shin,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UFC-MIL, a novel method for histopathological diagnostic aid using multiple-resolution images that ensures calibrated predictions, mimics pathologists' behavior, and achieves competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the demand for trustworthy diagnostic results in computational pathology, the paper highlights the lack of well-calibrated MIL models for histopathological diagnosis that clinicians can rely on.

Method: UFC-MIL is a MIL framework leveraging multiple-resolution images, a patch-wise loss to express uncertainty, an attention-based architecture with neighbor patch aggregation, and calibration using patch-level uncertainty.

Result: UFC-MIL delivers superior performance in model calibration and achieves competitive classification accuracy against state-of-the-art methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: The research provides a calibrated MIL approach allowing for reliable and competitive diagnostic predictions, mimicking pathologists in utilizing multiple-resolution examination for clinical use.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for histopathological specimen examination and diagnostic reporting, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has received heightened research focus as a viable solution for AI-centric diagnostic aid. Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.

### [300] [Countering Multi-modal Representation Collapse through Rank-targeted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06450)
*Seulgi Kim,Kiran Kokilepersaud,Mohit Prabhushankar,Ghassan AlRegib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the common issue of representation collapse in multi-modal fusion by proposing the Rank-enhancing Token Fuser, which improves fusion effectiveness in human action anticipation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fusion methods struggle with two types of representation collapse: feature collapse and modality collapse, especially in applications requiring diverse sensor data like human action anticipation.

Method: The framework introduces the concept of effective rank to measure and tackle both collapses simultaneously. It selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another to enhance effective rank and prevent modality imbalance.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves outcomes in action anticipation tasks, achieving up to 3.74% performance gain on datasets like NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The Rank-enhancing Token Fuser framework demonstrates that addressing feature and modality collapse through effective rank measurement leads to better fusion performance and sets a new state-of-the-art in action anticipation tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion methods often suffer from two types of representation collapse: feature collapse where individual dimensions lose their discriminative power (as measured by eigenspectra), and modality collapse where one dominant modality overwhelms the other. Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EIDSeg, a dataset for post-earthquake damage assessment using social media imagery, featuring semantic segmentation and benchmarks for better analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for post-earthquake damage assessment rely on expensive aerial imagery and binary maps, which limits rapid and detailed evaluation. Social media images could provide an efficient solution but lack annotated datasets for such assessments.

Method: This study developed EIDSeg, a semantic segmentation dataset based on social media imagery. It includes systematic annotations across five damage classes using a three-phase cross-disciplinary protocol with non-expert annotators.

Result: The EIDSeg dataset includes 3,266 annotated images from nine earthquakes. Several segmentation models were benchmarked, with EoMT achieving the highest mIoU at 80.8%, showcasing the efficacy of social media imagery.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and benchmarks demonstrate the potential of ground-level social media images for faster and more detailed damage assessment, revolutionizing post-earthquake rescue and planning processes.

Abstract: Rapid post-earthquake damage assessment is crucial for rescue and resource planning. Still, existing remote sensing methods depend on costly aerial images, expert labeling, and produce only binary damage maps for early-stage evaluation. Although ground-level images from social networks provide a valuable source to fill this gap, a large pixel-level annotated dataset for this task is still unavailable. We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%. By unlocking social networks' rich ground-level perspective, our work paves the way for a faster, finer-grained damage assessment in the post-earthquake scenario.

*Shaoxiang Wang,Shihong Zhang,Christen Millerdurai,Rüdiger Westermann,Didier Stricker,Alain Pagani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint360GS addresses challenges of 360° scene inpainting using 3D Gaussian Splatting, offering multi-object removal and consistent high-fidelity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360° scene inpainting is complex due to object identification, occlusions, and ensuring appearance consistency, and existing methods are insufficient.

Method: Inpaint360GS applies 2D segmentation into 3D and utilizes virtual camera views for precise editing and seamless scene recovery.

Result: Experiments validate that Inpaint360GS surpasses traditional methods, establishing state-of-the-art performance in 360° inpainting tasks.

Conclusion: Inpaint360GS offers a robust solution for 360° inpainting, setting a new benchmark while addressing technical challenges with a new dedicated dataset.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in single-object front-facing inpainting using NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), inpainting in complex 360° scenes remains largely underexplored. This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360° environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360° editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360° inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes. Experiments demonstrate that Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://dfki-av.github.io/inpaint360gs/

*Kyuho Lee,Euntae Kim,Jinwoo Choi,Buru Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NOAH, a benchmark to study narrative prior-induced errors, such as hallucinations and omissions, in Video LLMs, exposing gaps in grounding visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias in Video LLMs that prioritizes narrative coherence over strict visual accuracy, which leads to hallucinations and omissions of events.

Method: Develop NOAH, a benchmark that uses composite videos and evaluates narrative coherence errors systematically with tailored tasks and metrics.

Result: Findings show narrative priors cause hallucinations and omissions, vary across architectures, and amplify errors under sparse sampling, with over 60K evaluation samples analyzed.

Conclusion: NOAH establishes a foundational evaluation framework for narrative prior-induced errors in Video LLMs, guiding the development of more accurate models.

Abstract: Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models.

*Yule Chen,Yufan Ren,Sabine Süsstrunk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI4VA-FG, a benchmark for visual-language model (VLM) comprehension of comics, evaluating state-of-the-art models and proposing methods like Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) to address their major shortcomings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comics pose unique challenges for VLMs due to their stylized elements (line art, onomatopoeia, dense layouts) which existing models fail to handle effectively.

Method: The authors created AI4VA-FG, a fine-grained benchmark with comprehensive tasks and dense annotations for comic understanding. They also propose and test various post-training strategies, such as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and their novel Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL).

Result: Evaluation results show significant deficits in current VLMs handling the proposed comic benchmarks. RARL and other strategies improve performance in entity recognition and storyline ordering when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model.

Conclusion: Comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge, but the proposed benchmark (AI4VA-FG) and methods like RARL offer promising directions for advancing VLM capabilities in this domain.

Abstract: Complex visual narratives, such as comics, present a significant challenge to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SportR, a multi-sport benchmark designed to train and evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on sports reasoning, focusing on fine-grained perception and rule-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models are unable to combine nuanced visual perception with abstract rule-based reasoning required for understanding sports across multiple contexts, and existing benchmarks don't effectively assess these capabilities.

Method: The authors created SportR, a benchmark featuring 5,017 images, 2,101 videos, and 7,118 Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. It uses a progressive hierarchy of question-answer pairs to evaluate reasoning depth and includes manual bounding box annotations for precise visual grounding.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly on advanced tasks in SportR, even with Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning, exposing their limitations in sport-specific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SportR is a foundational challenge designed to push research in multimodal sports reasoning forward, exposing significant gaps in the current state of model capabilities and requiring more advanced methodologies for improvement.

Abstract: Deeply understanding sports requires an intricate blend of fine-grained visual perception and rule-based reasoning - a challenge that pushes the limits of current multimodal models. To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities. SportR presents a new challenge for the community, providing a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning.

TL;DR: The study introduces the PhaKIR dataset, a multi-institutional surgical dataset for instrument recognition and workflow analysis in robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery. It offers comprehensive annotations and supports benchmarking through the PhaKIR Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical datasets often address isolated tasks and lack temporal or multi-center data variability, hindering the development of robust computer vision systems for surgery.

Method: An annotated dataset of eight laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos from three medical centers was developed, encompassing surgical phase recognition, instrument keypoint estimation, and instance segmentation.

Result: The PhaKIR dataset provides 485,875 frame-level annotations for phase recognition and 19,435 frames for both keypoint estimation and instrument segmentation. It facilitates temporal analysis and was validated through benchmarking challenges.

Conclusion: This multi-functional PhaKIR dataset represents a significant resource for surgical scene understanding and computer-assisted surgery, addressing gaps in existing datasets and enabling extensive exploration of temporal context.

Abstract: Robotic- and computer-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) is increasingly relying on computer vision methods for reliable instrument recognition and surgical workflow understanding. Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames). PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance. The dataset is publicly available upon request via the Zenodo platform.

*Hui Sun,Long Lv,Pingping Zhang,Tongdan Tang,Feng Tian,Weibing Sun,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, SFMFusion, to improve multi-modal image fusion (MMIF) by addressing the limitations of CNNs and Transformers in feature extraction and enhancing Mamba's spatial and frequency domain capabilities. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods based on CNNs or Transformers exhibit limitations such as restricted receptive field or high computational costs, while Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perception critical for MMIF.

Method: The framework, SFMFusion, introduces a three-branch MMIF and IR coupling structure, a Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB) for effective feature extraction, and a Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) for dynamic feature integration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of SFMFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods across six MMIF datasets.

Conclusion: SFMFusion effectively improves MMIF by addressing spatial and frequency limitations and offers dynamic feature fusion, showcasing better results on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/SunHui1216/SFMFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an innovative framework to assess both lung and cardiovascular health from a single LDCT scan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing LDCT scans treat pulmonary and cardiovascular health independently, neglecting their physiological connections and shared imaging biomarkers.

Method: The framework incorporates three components: pulmonary perception to capture lung abnormalities, knowledge-guided reasoning to infer cardiovascular impacts, and cardiac representation for biomarker encoding, fused for holistic cardiovascular risk prediction.

Result: Through experiments on the NLST cohort, the framework demonstrates superior performance in CVD screening and mortality prediction, providing reasoning aligned with medical understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed explainable paradigm enhances cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, effectively connecting image-based predictions with relevant medical mechanisms.

Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

*Chenpeng Su,Wenhua Wu,Chensheng Peng,Tianchen Deng,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DIAL-GS, a self-supervised method utilizing 4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic instance-aware urban scene reconstruction, achieving higher reconstruction quality and enabling fine-grained editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised reconstruction methods rely on expensive annotations and lack scalability, while existing self-supervised approaches struggle with distinguishing dynamic elements and editing fine details in urban scenes.

Method: DIAL-GS exploits appearance-position inconsistencies to detect dynamic instances and uses instance-aware 4D Gaussians to achieve dynamic-adaptive and instance-aware reconstruction, supported by a reciprocal mechanism for enhanced consistency.

Result: The method surpasses current self-supervised baselines in both reconstruction quality and instance-level editing in urban driving scenes.

Conclusion: DIAL-GS provides an effective, label-free solution for urban scene reconstruction, improving dynamic perception and enabling better urban driving environment modeling.

Abstract: Urban scene reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling structured 3D representations for data synthesis and closed-loop testing. Supervised approaches rely on costly human annotations and lack scalability, while current self-supervised methods often confuse static and dynamic elements and fail to distinguish individual dynamic objects, limiting fine-grained editing. We propose DIAL-GS, a novel dynamic instance-aware reconstruction method for label-free street scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting. We first accurately identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position inconsistency between warped rendering and actual observation. Guided by instance-level dynamic perception, we employ instance-aware 4D Gaussians as the unified volumetric representation, realizing dynamic-adaptive and instance-aware reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a reciprocal mechanism through which identity and dynamics reinforce each other, enhancing both integrity and consistency. Experiments on urban driving scenarios show that DIAL-GS surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality and instance-level editing, offering a concise yet powerful solution for urban scene modeling.

*Ximiao Zhang,Min Xu,Zheng Zhang,Junlin Hu,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniADC, a model for unified anomaly detection and classification, outperforming existing methods by leveraging synthetic anomaly data and multitask learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, ignoring their correlation and limiting performance.

Method: The proposed UniADC uses a training-free inpainting network to synthesize anomaly images and a multi-task discriminator for anomaly detection and classification.

Result: Experiments on three datasets (MVTec-FS, MTD, WFDD) show UniADC achieves superior performance in detection, localization, and classification tasks.

Conclusion: UniADC effectively unifies anomaly detection and classification, leveraging synthetic data and joint learning to improve results significantly.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the task of unified anomaly detection and classification, which aims to simultaneously detect anomalous regions in images and identify their specific categories. Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

*Siqi Hui,Sanping Zhou,Ye deng,Wenli Huang,Jinjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FreqGRL, a framework for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) using frequency-space techniques to tackle source-target data imbalance and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving recognition of novel classes in scenarios with domain shifts and limited labeled target-domain data, which results in data imbalance challenges for representation learning.

Method: The framework uses frequency-space techniques, including Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR), High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE), and Global Frequency Filter (GFF), to address domain-specific biases, enhance generalization features, and suppress irrelevant frequencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on five CD-FSL benchmarks show FreqGRL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: FreqGRL effectively mitigates data imbalance challenges and improves cross-domain generalization through frequency-guided techniques.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) aims to recognize novel classes with only a few labeled examples under significant domain shifts. While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The study introduces NOVO, a framework using visual-only prompts for bridging vision-language models and segmentation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve alignment and segmentation quality by removing reliance on text-derived SEG embeddings, leveraging visual-only prompts instead.

Method: NOVO generates coarse masks and point prompts from visual outputs while using a training-free refinement module to enhance boundary quality and reduce artifacts.

Result: Experiments show that NOVO surpasses previous approaches across multiple metrics and introduces a benchmark called RISeg for evaluation.

Conclusion: NOVO effectively bridges VLMs and segmentation models using visual prompts, showcasing its scalability and performance in reasoning segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In this study, we propose NOVO (NO text, Visual-Only prompts), a novel framework that bridges vision-language models (VLMs) and segmentation models through visual-only prompts. Unlike prior approaches that feed text-derived SEG token embeddings into segmentation models, NOVO instead generates a coarse mask and point prompts from the VLM output. These visual prompts are compatible with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), preserving alignment with its pretrained capabilities. To further enhance boundary quality and enable instance-level segmentation, we introduce a training-free refinement module that reduces visual artifacts and improves the quality of segmentation masks. We also present RISeg, a new benchmark comprising 918 images, 2,533 instance-level masks, and diverse reasoning queries to evaluate this task. Experiments demonstrate that NOVO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics and model sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in reasoning segmentation.

*Ruijia Wu,Ping Chen,Fei Shen,Shaoan Zhao,Qiang Hui,Huanlin Gao,Ting Lu,Zhaoxiang Liu,Fang Zhao,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMo-CLIP enhances CLIP models for better handling of complex, hierarchical, and long-form text in image-text retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CLIP models struggle with capturing semantic hierarchy and monotonicity in complex text descriptions, impacting their retrieval accuracy.

Method: HiMo-CLIP incorporates hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) using in-batch PCA and monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) to align text and image representations more effectively.

Result: Experiments show HiMo-CLIP surpasses baseline models, especially in retrieval tasks involving long or compositional text descriptions.

Conclusion: The introduced framework significantly improves cross-modal representation alignment, offering enhanced performance for advanced text descriptions in retrieval benchmarks.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have achieved impressive results in image-text retrieval by aligning image and text representations in a shared embedding space. However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

*Depanshu Sani,Mehar Khurana,Saket Anand*

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Active Learning-based framework for animal Re-ID, addressing limitations of unsupervised and existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance using minimal annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in animal Re-ID due to complex requirements such as subtle patterns recognition, handling unknown species, and the open-set nature of the task.

Method: The proposed framework employs an Active Learning (AL) approach with clustering methods to detect ambiguous regions in data, enabling effective and efficient pair selection alongside constrained clustering refinement.

Result: The approach demonstrates significant improvement, achieving 10.49%, 11.19%, and 3.99% higher mAP over foundational, USL, and AL baselines on wildlife datasets, with state-of-the-art results in open-world settings as well.

Conclusion: The methodology proves that it is possible to enhance Re-ID accuracy while drastically reducing training annotations by targeting informative and representative pairs within a clustering-based AL approach.

Abstract: Animal Re-ID has recently gained substantial attention in the AI research community due to its high impact on biodiversity monitoring and unique research challenges arising from environmental factors. The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Furthermore, we also show an improvement of 11.09%, 8.2% and 2.06% for unknown individuals in an open-world setting.

Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of models that combine medical image segmentation and explainable diagnoses, which are critical for better patient outcomes and understanding.

Method: Introducing MDS, the authors present the M3DS dataset and the Sim4Seg framework, including the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module and a test-time scaling strategy.

Result: The experimental results show that their method significantly outperforms existing baseline models in both segmentation and diagnosis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines segmentation and diagnosis tasks, providing an advance towards more explainable and accurate medical image analysis models.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in pixel-level medical image analysis, existing medical image segmentation models rarely explore medical segmentation and diagnosis tasks jointly. However, it is crucial for patients that models can provide explainable diagnoses along with medical segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a medical vision-language task named Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (MDS), which aims to understand clinical queries for medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation masks as well as diagnostic results. To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes REOcc, a camera-radar fusion network for improving radar feature representation and achieving better 3D occupancy prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of vision-based 3D occupancy prediction relying solely on cameras, struggling in challenging environments. Camera-radar fusion is promising, yet hindered by radar data's sparsity and noise.

Method: REOcc introduces two components: a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier. These components refine radar features by enhancing spatial density and incorporating contextual information.

Result: Experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that REOcc significantly outperforms a camera-only model, especially for dynamic object classes.

Conclusion: REOcc effectively mitigates radar data issues, enabling better camera-radar integration and improving robust 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction has made significant advancements, but its reliance on cameras alone struggles in challenging environments. This limitation has driven the adoption of sensor fusion, among which camera-radar fusion stands out as a promising solution due to their complementary strengths. However, the sparsity and noise of the radar data limits its effectiveness, leading to suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose REOcc, a novel camera-radar fusion network designed to enrich radar feature representations for 3D occupancy prediction. Our approach introduces two main components, a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier, which refine radar features by integrating spatial and contextual information, effectively enhancing spatial density and quality. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that REOcc achieves significant performance gains over the camera-only baseline model, particularly in dynamic object classes. These results underscore REOcc's capability to mitigate the sparsity and noise of the radar data. Consequently, radar complements camera data more effectively, unlocking the full potential of camera-radar fusion for robust and reliable 3D occupancy prediction.

*Xingbo Du,Qiantong Dou,Lei Fan,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM) enhances traditional CBMs by introducing dynamic adaptation of concepts without full retraining, using hypernetworks and a modified sparsemax module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CBMs require full retraining to include new concepts, limiting adaptability amidst rapidly evolving vision-language models.

Method: FCBM employs a hypernetwork to generate prediction weights for new concepts, along with a sparsemax module with learnable parameters to dynamically prioritize relevant concepts.

Result: FCBM achieves similar accuracy to state-of-the-art models while being adaptable to unseen concepts with minimal fine-tuning and supports complete replacement of original concept sets.

Conclusion: FCBM provides a flexible and efficient framework for concept adaptation in CBMs, addressing core limitations of traditional methods in real-world applications.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) improve neural network interpretability by introducing an intermediate layer that maps human-understandable concepts to predictions. Recent work has explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate concept selection and annotation. However, existing VLM-based CBMs typically require full model retraining when new concepts are involved, which limits their adaptability and flexibility in real-world scenarios, especially considering the rapid evolution of vision-language foundation models. To address these issues, we propose Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM), which supports dynamic concept adaptation, including complete replacement of the original concept set. Specifically, we design a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights based on concept embeddings, allowing seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model. In addition, we introduce a modified sparsemax module with a learnable temperature parameter that dynamically selects the most relevant concepts, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts. Moreover, the model generalizes well to unseen concepts with just a single epoch of fine-tuning, demonstrating its strong adaptability and flexibility.

*Yulim So,Seokho Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnoStyler introduces a lightweight, effective method for generating realistic anomalies in images using text-guided style transfer, addressing key challenges in anomaly generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to anomaly generation face challenges such as poor visual realism, high dependency on image datasets, and reliance on resource-intensive models, limiting their practical application.

Method: The proposed method, AnoStyler, employs a lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions to transform single normal images into realistic anomaly images. It leverages text-guided style transfer, anomaly masks, and category-independent text prompts to localize and align anomalies.

Result: Experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate that AnoStyler generates visually realistic and diverse anomalies, outperforming previous methods. Its outputs also improve the performance of anomaly detection systems.

Conclusion: AnoStyler offers an efficient, scalable, and accurate anomaly generation solution by addressing major drawbacks of current methods, benefiting real-world applications in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly generation has been widely explored to address the scarcity of anomaly images in real-world data. However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images. Furthermore, using these generated anomalies helps enhance anomaly detection performance.

*Jianyu Qi,Ding Zou,Wenrui Yan,Rui Ma,Jiaxu Li,Zhijie Zheng,Zhiguo Yang,Rongchang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces difficulty-aware sampling strategies to optimize post-training paradigms for multimodal reasoning in MLLMs. Strategies include systematic image masking and attention analysis, outperforming traditional pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-training methods for MLLMs fail to adequately screen data by difficulty or optimize perception and reasoning simultaneously.

Method: Two sampling strategies are proposed: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) and Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB). These metrics guide a hierarchical training framework involving GRPO-only and hybrid SFT+GRPO paradigms.

Result: Experiments across six benchmarks show GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples achieves better accuracy without supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Strategic difficulty-based sampling improves MLLM reasoning accuracy and efficiency, eliminating dependence on traditional SFT paradigms.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have spurred significant progress in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

*Yifan Wang,Yian Zhao,Fanqi Pu,Xiaochen Yang,Yang Tang,Xi Chen,Wenming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPAN, a method to improve monocular 3D object detection by addressing geometric inconsistencies with two novel alignment strategies using spatial and projection constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing monocular 3D detectors which use decoupled prediction paradigms but ignore geometric collaborative constraints, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The paper introduces the Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) technique with Spatial Point Alignment for global spatial constraints and 3D-2D Projection Alignment for projection consistency, along with a hierarchical task learning strategy.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves performance and can be integrated into any existing monocular 3D detector.

Conclusion: SPAN addresses geometric inconsistency and projection misalignment, offering a robust solution for improved monocular 3D detection performance.

Abstract: Existing monocular 3D detectors typically tame the pronounced nonlinear regression of 3D bounding box through decoupled prediction paradigm, which employs multiple branches to estimate geometric center, depth, dimensions, and rotation angle separately. Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily integrated into any established monocular 3D detector and delivers significant performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address flaws in existing virtual staining methods which struggle with spatial misalignment due to tissue slice inconsistencies.

Method: K-Stain employs a Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD), a Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG), and a Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) for image generation.

Result: K-Stain provides better quantitative metrics and visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Keypoint-based approaches in virtual staining enhance structural detail integration and spatial correspondence for more accurate and reliable synthesized IHC images.

Abstract: Virtual staining offers a promising method for converting Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images into Immunohistochemical (IHC) images, eliminating the need for costly chemical processes. However, existing methods often struggle to utilize spatial information effectively due to misalignment in tissue slices. To overcome this challenge, we leverage keypoints as robust indicators of spatial correspondence, enabling more precise alignment and integration of structural details in synthesized IHC images. We introduce K-Stain, a novel framework that employs keypoint-based spatial and semantic relationships to enhance synthesized IHC image fidelity. K-Stain comprises three main components: (1) a Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) for identifying keypoints in stain images, (2) a Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG) that integrates these keypoints during image generation, and (3) a Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) that improves the discriminator's sensitivity to spatial details. Our approach leverages contextual information from adjacent slices, resulting in more accurate and visually consistent IHC images. Extensive experiments show that K-Stain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Result: MirrorMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods in video mirror detection performance on benchmark datasets and shows robustness on challenging image-based datasets.

Conclusion: MirrorMamba provides an effective and scalable solution to video mirror detection challenges, demonstrating exceptional performance and adaptability through novel architectural innovations.

Abstract: Video mirror detection has received significant research attention, yet existing methods suffer from limited performance and robustness. These approaches often over-rely on single, unreliable dynamic features, and are typically built on CNNs with limited receptive fields or Transformers with quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a new effective and scalable video mirror detection method, called MirrorMamba. Our approach leverages multiple cues to adapt to diverse conditions, incorporating perceived depth, correspondence and optical. We also introduce an innovative Mamba-based Multidirection Correspondence Extractor, which benefits from the global receptive field and linear complexity of the emerging Mamba spatial state model to effectively capture correspondence properties. Additionally, we design a Mamba-based layer-wise boundary enforcement decoder to resolve the unclear boundary caused by the blurred depth map. Notably, this work marks the first successful application of the Mamba-based architecture in the field of mirror detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for video mirror detection on the benchmark datasets. Furthermore, on the most challenging and representative image-based mirror detection dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, proving its robustness and generalizability.

Method: The proposed approach involves the MRT architecture, which partitions images into windows and uses RWKV modules for global dependencies and Transformer blocks for local redundancies. The RWKV Compression Model (RCM) further optimizes the compression based on the structure of the 1-D representation.

Result: Experiments show that MRT achieves superior reconstruction quality at ultra-low bitrates (< 0.02 bpp). It outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, with significant bitrate savings demonstrated on Kodak (43.75%) and CLIC2020 (30.59%) datasets.

Conclusion: The MRT architecture effectively reduces spatial redundancy and improves coding efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art in extreme image compression.

Abstract: Recent advances in extreme image compression have revealed that mapping pixel data into highly compact latent representations can significantly improve coding efficiency. However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.

*Zizhao Li,Zhengkang Xiang,Jiayang Ao,Joseph West,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relative Energy Learning (REL) and Point Raise to enhance Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection for LiDAR-based autonomous driving, improving its reliability with robust detection of anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems by addressing the failures of existing methods in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in 3D LiDAR point clouds.

Method: The paper proposes Relative Energy Learning (REL) for OOD detection using the relative scoring function from energy gaps, combined with a synthetic data generation strategy, Point Raise, which perturbs LiDAR point clouds to create auxiliary anomalies.

Result: Experimental evaluation on benchmarks such as SemanticKITTI and STU demonstrates that REL significantly outperforms existing OOD detection methods for LiDAR data.

Conclusion: Modeling relative energy and utilizing synthetic outliers offer a scalable and effective framework for improving OOD detection in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for reliable autonomous driving, where safety depends on recognizing road obstacles and unexpected objects beyond the training distribution. Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results highlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic outliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving.

TL;DR: AvatarTex proposes a framework for high-fidelity facial texture reconstruction using a single image, combining diffuse and GAN models to resolve challenges in stylized avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial texture reconstruction methods struggle with geometric consistency and stylization due to limited datasets and technical challenges.

Method: A three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline is introduced, combining diffusion models for diversification and GANs for topology consistency in texture synthesis.

Result: AvatarTex successfully synthesizes high-quality topology-aligned textures for both photorealistic and stylized avatars. Additionally, a dataset, TexHub, containing 20,000 multi-style UV textures, is introduced.

Conclusion: AvatarTex advances facial texture reconstruction, offering improved artistic geometric coherence. TexHub dataset will drive future research in stylized texture synthesis.

Abstract: We present AvatarTex, a high-fidelity facial texture reconstruction framework capable of generating both stylized and photorealistic textures from a single image. Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction. TexHub will be released upon publication to facilitate future research in this field.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.

TL;DR: Rain diminishes the quality of multi-view images, affecting 3D scene reconstruction. The paper introduces a novel dataset, OmniRain3D, and a reconstruction framework, REVR-GSNet, to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D scene reconstruction is hindered by rain effects, especially viewpoint-dependent rain streaks and reduced ambient brightness, which existing datasets fail to consider.

Method: The approach involves creating the OmniRain3D dataset to realistically simulate rain degradation and developing REVR-GSNet, which combines brightness enhancement, Gaussian primitive optimization, and rain elimination.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy and fidelity in reconstructing clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs using the proposed dataset and framework.

Conclusion: The work enhances rainy 3D scene reconstruction, setting a solid foundation for future studies on multi-view deraining and reconstruction.

Abstract: Rain degrades the visual quality of multi-view images, which are essential for 3D scene reconstruction, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete reconstruction results. Existing datasets often overlook two critical characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Specifically, REVR-GSNet integrates recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian primitive optimization, and GS-guided rain elimination into a unified architecture through joint alternating optimization, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our dataset and method. Our dataset and method provide a foundation for future research on multi-view image deraining and rainy 3D scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Otter, a method with segmentation and temporal reconstruction modules to address challenges in wide-angle few-shot action recognition caused by background distractions and temporal relation degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in FSAR struggle with effective action recognition in wide-angle videos due to distraction from background elements and difficulty in reconstructing temporal relations.

Method: The proposed Otter framework integrates a Compound Segmentation Module (CSM) to emphasize subjects by segmenting key patches, and a Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) to improve temporal relations through bidirectional scanning. These are combined into a comprehensive prototype construction approach.

Result: Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSAR benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51, with further validation on the VideoBadminton dataset demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: The segmentation and reconstruction strategy significantly enhances FSAR performance by addressing background complexity and improving temporal modeling, solidifying Otter as a robust approach for wide-angle video action recognition.

Abstract: Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition (FSAR) effectively express actions within specific scenarios. However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.

TL;DR: The paper integrates flow matching generative models with Plug-and-Play (PnP) frameworks to enhance image restoration by handling general fidelity terms, addressing non-Gaussian noises like Poisson and impulse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PnP methods perform well with Gaussian noise but have limited exploration with general fidelity terms for complex non-Gaussian noise.

Method: Generative priors are incorporated via the PnP framework using the proximal operator replaced with a time-dependent denoiser. The proposed method is inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) approach.

Result: The technique is efficient, flexible for various fidelity terms, and supports non-Gaussian noise types. It validates its computational benefits and outperforms traditional squared $\ell_2$ loss under non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: The proposed framework broadens the scope of PnP methods, proving its utility in handling diverse noise types across multiple image restoration tasks.

Abstract: Regularized optimization has been a classical approach to solving imaging inverse problems, where the regularization term enforces desirable properties of the unknown image. Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical multimodal models oversimplify symptom-organ associations and mainly use 2D features, which limits accurate clinical reasoning.

Method: Med-SORA employs RAG-based dataset creation, learnable organ anchors for soft labeling, and a 2D-3D cross-attention model to integrate local and global features.

Result: Med-SORA outperforms conventional models in clinical multimodal tasks and enhances 3D clinical reasoning.

Conclusion: The study presents Med-SORA as a pioneering model for accurate symptom-to-organ reasoning, addressing limitations in existing multimodal methods.

Abstract: Understanding symptom-image associations is crucial for clinical reasoning. However, existing medical multimodal models often rely on simple one-to-one hard labeling, oversimplifying clinical reality where symptoms relate to multiple organs. In addition, they mainly use single-slice 2D features without incorporating 3D information, limiting their ability to capture full anatomical context. In this study, we propose Med-SORA, a framework for symptom-to-organ reasoning in abdominal CT images. Med-SORA introduces RAG-based dataset construction, soft labeling with learnable organ anchors to capture one-to-many symptom-organ relationships, and a 2D-3D cross-attention architecture to fuse local and global image features. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address symptom-to-organ reasoning in medical multimodal learning. Experimental results show that Med-SORA outperforms existing medical multimodal models and enables accurate 3D clinical reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of purple flare artifacts in images using a novel two-stage network based on HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs) for independent color corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional hand-crafted methods and the lack of paired training data in deep learning for resolving purple flare issues in image processing.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a two-stage neural network: first, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) encodes image data into HSV space tokens; second, an HSV-LUT module generates 1D correction curves for Hue, Saturation, and Value channels separately.

Result: The model outperforms both traditional and existing methods in visual improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results in various quantitative metrics. A large-scale purple flare dataset and task-specific metrics were also introduced.

Conclusion: The novel approach effectively resolves purple flare artifacts, simplifies color correction, and provides a new benchmark for evaluating solutions in this domain.

Abstract: Purple flare, a diffuse chromatic aberration artifact commonly found around highlight areas, severely degrades the tone transition and color of the image. Existing traditional methods are based on hand-crafted features, which lack flexibility and rely entirely on fixed priors, while the scarcity of paired training data critically hampers deep learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes. We also proposed new metrics and a loss function specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address problems like unstable pose estimation and scene distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistencies in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures.

Method: The paper introduces a two-fold approach: utilizing LiDAR-IMU Odometry for camera pose prior integration with COLMAP and introducing constraints (normal vector and effective rank regularization) on Gaussian primitives to improve map quality. These steps are optimized along with photometric loss.

Result: The proposed method reduces pose optimization time by two-thirds while maintaining accuracy and robustness and significantly improves visual quality in both public and self-collected datasets with weak and repetitive textures.

Conclusion: The approach improves robustness, map quality, and visualization capabilities for large-scale, texture-challenged outdoor scenes, outperforming conventional 3DGS pipelines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConeGS introduces an innovative framework for novel view synthesis using 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods suffer from inefficient spatial primitives distribution due to their reliance on cloning-based densification, which limits coverage and exploration.

Method: ConeGS uses a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitive (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy, identifies high-error pixels using predicted depth, and inserts primitives accordingly. It employs strategies like opacity penalties and primitive budgeting to refine results efficiently.

Result: Experiments demonstrate ConeGS improves reconstruction quality and rendering performance, especially under constraints like limited primitives.

Conclusion: ConeGS ensures efficient placement of primitives and achieves enhanced rendering quality and performance, making it a robust solution for novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves state-of-the-art image quality and real-time performance in novel view synthesis but often suffers from a suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives. This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.

### [336] [TiS-TSL: Image-Label Supervised Surgical Video Stereo Matching via Time-Switchable Teacher-Student Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06817)
*Rui Wang,Ying Zhou,Hao Wang,Wenwei Zhang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TiS-TSL, a framework for stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery using video-based teacher-student learning, addressing temporal consistency for improved disparity predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimally invasive surgery requires precise stereo matching, which is difficult due to sparse annotations. Current methods lack spatio-temporal consistency, leading to artifacts in video frames.

Method: TiS-TSL employs a unified model with three modes (IP, FVP, BVP) and a two-stage learning strategy (I2V for initialization and V2V for refinement) to improve spatio-temporal reliability in stereo matching.

Result: Experiments on two datasets show TiS-TSL outperforms existing methods, improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively.

Conclusion: TiS-TSL advances stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery by leveraging temporal modeling and consistency, enhancing video reliability under minimal supervision.

Abstract: Stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is essential for next-generation navigation and augmented reality. Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively..

*Ji Li,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative diffusion prior-based framework for robust image restoration under various noise types, including impulse noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing plug-and-play image restoration techniques focus on Gaussian noise and rarely address non-Gaussian noise like impulse noise.

Method: The authors adapt the MAP estimation framework by introducing a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based fidelity term instead of conventional least-squares loss, utilizing IRLS optimization with diffusion-based denoisers.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method successfully removes non-Gaussian impulse noise, yielding superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating generative diffusion priors with iterative optimization provides effective and versatile solutions for image restoration under diverse noise distributions.

Abstract: Existing plug-and-play image restoration methods typically employ off-the-shelf Gaussian denoisers as proximal operators within classical optimization frameworks based on variable splitting. Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a subjective quality assessment method and dataset for evaluating 3D object reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting (GS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed using GS-based methods is currently challenging and lacks standardization.

Method: A multi-distance subjective quality assessment method mimicking human viewing behavior is proposed, alongside the creation of the MUGSQA dataset incorporating various input uncertainties.

Result: Two benchmarks are constructed: one for assessing robustness of GS-based methods under uncertainties and another for evaluating existing quality assessment metrics.

Conclusion: The research enhances the evaluation of GS-based 3D reconstruction techniques, providing tools and benchmarks to improve their perceptual quality assessment.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for 3D object reconstruction, delivering high-quality rendering results with significantly improved reconstruction speed. As variants continue to appear, assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics. Our dataset and benchmark code will be released soon.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ConsistTalk, a framework addressing issues in audio-driven portrait animation such as flickering and poor audio-visual synchronization, through advanced motion decoupling and inference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models face challenges like flickering, identity drift, and audio-visual desynchronization due to entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference.

Method: ConsistTalk combines an optical flow-guided temporal module, an audio-to-intensity model using multimodal knowledge distillation, and a diffusion noise initialization strategy for refined motion dynamics and coherence.

Result: ConsistTalk achieves reduced flicker, improved identity preservation, and temporally consistent, high-fidelity talking head videos in comparison to prior methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates significant improvements in audio-driven talking head generation, achieving better synchronization, fidelity, and visual consistency through innovative techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced audio-driven portrait animation. However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization. Third, we introduce a \textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistTalk significantly outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel self-supervised framework called NeuroBridge, combining Cognitive Prior Augmentation and Shared Semantic Projector to improve visual neural decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges faced in visual neural decoding, including the scarcity of high-quality data and semantic mismatches between neural and visual representations.

Method: The proposed NeuroBridge framework integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation to simulate perceptual variability and Shared Semantic Projector for bidirectional cross-modality alignment, optimizing the alignment between EEG signals and visual stimuli.

Result: NeuroBridge outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 63.2% top-1 accuracy and 89.9% top-5 accuracy in intra-subject visual decoding tasks, representing significant improvements.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates superior performance, robustness, and scalability, making it a promising approach for advancing neural visual decoding and cross-modal learning.

Abstract: Visual neural decoding seeks to reconstruct or infer perceived visual stimuli from brain activity patterns, providing critical insights into human cognition and enabling transformative applications in brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence. Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed framework for neural visual decoding.

TL;DR: HYDRA is a new Multi-BFT consensus framework that eliminates global ordering to improve scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of classical BFT protocols, such as leader bottlenecks, scalability issues, and inefficiencies introduced by global ordering layers.

Method: Introduced an object-centric execution model with partitions for transactions and incorporated lightweight lock-based coordination combined with a deadlock resolution mechanism.

Result: HYDRA was implemented and tested in environments with up to 128 replicas, outperforming other state-of-the-art Multi-BFT protocols, particularly under straggler conditions.

Conclusion: Eliminating global ordering is effective in ensuring high performance and strong consistency, providing a new direction for scalable Multi-BFT consensus design.

Abstract: Multi-Byzantine Fault Tolerant (Multi-BFT) consensus, which runs multiple BFT instances in parallel, has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome the leader bottleneck in classical BFT protocols. However, existing designs rely on a global ordering layer to serialize blocks across instances, an intuitive yet costly mechanism that constrains scalability, amplifies failure propagation, and complicates deployment. In this paper, we challenge this conventional wisdom. We present HYDRA, the first Multi-BFT consensus framework that eliminates global ordering altogether. HYDRA introduces an object-centric execution model that partitions transactions by their accessed objects, enabling concurrent yet deterministic execution across instances. To ensure consistency, HYDRA combines lightweight lock-based coordination with a deadlock resolution mechanism, achieving both scalability and correctness. We implement HYDRA and evaluate it on up to 128 replicas in both LAN and WAN environments. Experimental results show HYDRA outperforms several state-of-the-art Multi-BFT protocols in the presence of a straggler. These results demonstrate strong consistency and high performance by removing global ordering, opening a new direction toward scalable Multi-BFT consensus design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoEdge-RAG, a hierarchical scheduling framework to enhance retrieval-augmented LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, leveraging cross-node collaboration to optimize performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for real-time responsiveness and data privacy preservation in deploying LLMs on edge devices while improving inference quality using retrieval-augmented methods.

Method: The framework incorporates online query identification, dynamic inter-node scheduling, and an intra-node scheduler using advanced optimization techniques like PPO and online convex optimization.

Result: The proposed approach improves collaborative retrieval-augmented LLM performance, showing gains of 4.23% to 91.39% over baseline methods across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoEdge-RAG introduces efficient mechanisms to optimize latency-quality trade-offs under privacy constraints, demonstrating significant enhancements in edge computing environments.

Abstract: Motivated by the imperative for real-time responsiveness and data privacy preservation, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices to enable localized inference. To improve output quality, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an efficient technique that seamlessly integrates local data into LLMs. However, existing edge computing paradigms primarily focus on single-node optimization, neglecting opportunities to holistically exploit distributed data and heterogeneous resources through cross-node collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose CoEdge-RAG, a hierarchical scheduling framework for retrieval-augmented LLMs in collaborative edge computing. In general, privacy constraints preclude accurate a priori acquisition of heterogeneous data distributions across edge nodes, directly impeding RAG performance optimization. Thus, we first design an online query identification mechanism using proximal policy optimization (PPO), which autonomously infers query semantics and establishes cross-domain knowledge associations in an online manner. Second, we devise a dynamic inter-node scheduling strategy that balances workloads across heterogeneous edge nodes by synergizing historical performance analytics with real-time resource thresholds. Third, we develop an intra-node scheduler based on online convex optimization, adaptively allocating query processing ratios and memory resources to optimize the latency-quality trade-off under fluctuating assigned loads. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse QA benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly boosts the performance of collaborative retrieval-augmented LLMs, achieving performance gains of 4.23\% to 91.39\% over baseline methods across all tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to enhance wireless network efficiency by addressing challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning with satellite-terrestrial architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to handle massive connectivity and energy-efficient operations in wireless networks, alongside challenges like time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, necessitates improved methods for decision-making and coordination.

Method: The paper proposes employing agent-based world models for predictive environment representations and selective edge coordination to optimize performance, incorporating imagination-based policy training and uncertainty-aware actions.

Result: The DWM-RO framework achieves a faster convergence (5x) compared to baselines, along with higher spectral efficiency (+34.7%) and reduced constraint violations (-40%). In dense scenarios with 10 users, it maintains lower violation rates (<20%).

Conclusion: DWM-RO successfully addresses existing decentralized MARL limitations, providing faster convergence, enhanced efficiency, and superior robustness in complex wireless network setups.

Abstract: Wireless networks are undergoing a paradigm shift toward massive connectivity with energy-efficient operation, driving the integration of satellite-terrestrial architectures with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Optimizing transmit beamforming and power splitting in such systems faces formidable challenges, e.g., time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, which create a complex decision landscape where conventional model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from sample inefficiency due to rarely-encountered state transitions and poor coordination as decentralized agents act independently. This paper proposes the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, each agent employs a world model to learn compact predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling imagination-based policy training that dramatically reduces required environment interactions. An uncertainty-aware offloading gate monitors local interference levels and model reconstruction errors to trigger selective edge coordination. When activated, a lightweight latent decorrelation mechanism at the edge refines agents' strategic representations, guiding them toward orthogonal actions that minimize resource conflicts. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DWM-RO converges 5 times faster than state-of-the-art baselines while achieving 34.7% higher spectral efficiency and reducing constraint violations by 40%. In dense network scenarios with 10 users, DWM-RO maintains violation rates below 20% while baselines exceed 70%, validating superior robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing multi-level loop nests in scientific computing can exploit opportunities like parallelism and efficient data movement, yet low-level compiler representations hinder analysis of patterns.

Method: SILO models data accesses and dependencies symbolically based on loop nest strides, enabling automatic parallelization and data movement optimizations.

Result: The SILO technique was applied to scientific kernels, achieving up to 12× speedup compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SILO demonstrates substantial promise for automated loop optimization and data movement enhancement in high-performance computing scenarios.

Abstract: Scientific computing applications heavily rely on multi-level loop nests operating on multidimensional arrays. This presents multiple optimization opportunities from exploiting parallelism to reducing data movement through prefetching and improved register usage. HPC frameworks often delegate fine-grained data movement optimization to compilers, but their low-level representations hamper analysis of common patterns, such as strided data accesses and loop-carried dependencies. In this paper, we introduce symbolic, inductive loop optimization (SILO), a novel technique that models data accesses and dependencies as functions of loop nest strides. This abstraction enables the automatic parallelization of sequentially-dependent loops, as well as data movement optimizations including software prefetching and pointer incrementation to reduce register spills. We demonstrate SILO on fundamental kernels from scientific applications with a focus on atmospheric models and numerical solvers, achieving up to 12$\times$ speedup over the state of the art.

TL;DR: Electricity demand is growing due to electrification and AI, and current practices to manage carbon intensity often rely on complex forecasting methods. LiteCast is a simpler, efficient forecasting method achieving near-optimal savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing electricity demands and environmental concerns, there is a need for efficient and less resource-intensive forecasting strategies to estimate grid carbon intensity and optimize its management.

Method: The authors introduce LiteCast, a lightweight and adaptive time series forecasting model based on a limited amount of historical energy and weather data to estimate carbon intensity efficiently and quickly.

Result: LiteCast demonstrates superior performance in forecasting across 50 regions globally, achieving 97% of optimal savings and delivering 20% higher savings compared to state-of-the-art methods, while remaining fast and resource-efficient.

Conclusion: LiteCast is an effective and efficient carbon intensity forecasting tool that balances performance and practicality, making it suitable for real-world applications and promoting environmental sustainability.

Abstract: Over recent decades, electricity demand has experienced sustained growth through widespread electrification of transportation and the accelerated expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in current dynamic Sequence Parallelism (SP) allocation for large language model inference, including inflexibility in parallelism handling, latency degradation, and underutilization of fragmented resources.

Method: The authors proposed CDSP, which allocates SP sizes across token segments, and developed Tetris, a system integrating CDSP into disaggregated clusters while dynamically adjusting SP size based on load and optimizing resource utilization.

Result: Tetris outperformed state-of-the-art systems with up to 4.35× lower time-to-first-token (TTFT), 40.1% reduction in median time-between-tokens (TBT), and 45% increased request capacity.

Conclusion: Chunkwise Dynamic Sequence Parallelism and the Tetris system provide a scalable and efficient solution for handling diverse demands and resource optimization in LLM inference environments.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their context windows have rapidly expanded. To meet diverse demands from varying-length requests in online services, existing state-of-the-art systems tune the sequence parallelism (SP) allocation. However, current dynamic SP allocation lacks flexibility to (1) support stage-specific parallelism requirements in LLM inference, (2) mitigate the global latency degradation from excessive SP allocation, and (3) exploit resource fragments arising from SP size variation.
  To tackle this problem, we propose Chunkwise Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (CDSP), a fine-grained parallelism strategy that assigns SP sizes across \textit{intra-request} token segments. Based on CDSP, we build Tetris, an LLM serving system that (1) efficiently integrates CDSP into disaggregated cluster to satisfy parallelism heterogeneity, (2) dynamically regulates SP size expansion based on real-time load conditions, and (3) adaptively explores chunking plans to utilize fragmented resources while meeting per-request demands. Compared with state-of-the-art systems, Tetris achieves up to 4.35$\times$ lower time-to-first-token (TTFT) under max sustainable loads, reduces median time-between-tokens (TBT) by up to 40.1\%, and increases the max request capacity by up to 45\%.

Motivation: The need for expert-level tuning in high-performance kernel design and the limitations of existing AI kernel generation systems in addressing low-level performance bottlenecks.

Method: PRAGMA integrates execution feedback and fine-grained hardware profiling within a reasoning loop, leveraging LLMs for iterative refinements and bottleneck identification.

Result: PRAGMA outperforms baseline models and achieves 2.81x and 2.30x speedups on CPUs and GPUs, respectively, as tested on KernelBench.

Conclusion: Incorporating profiling into kernel generation enables better performance tuning and code optimization using AI-driven approaches.

Abstract: Designing high-performance kernels requires expert-level tuning and a deep understanding of hardware characteristics. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated kernel generation, yet most existing systems rely solely on correctness or execution time feedback, lacking the ability to reason about low-level performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce PRAGMA, a profile-guided AI kernel generation framework that integrates execution feedback and fine-grained hardware profiling into the reasoning loop. PRAGMA enables LLMs to identify performance bottlenecks, preserve historical best versions, and iteratively refine code quality. We evaluate PRAGMA on KernelBench, covering GPU and CPU backends. Results show that PRAGMA consistently outperforms baseline AIKG without profiling enabled and achieves 2.81$\times$ and 2.30$\times$ averaged speedups against Torch on CPU and GPU platforms, respectively.

TL;DR: Saarthi, a serverless framework, enhances FaaS platforms by addressing challenges like startup latencies and sub-optimal resource management. It achieves better throughput, reduced costs, and high service-level targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FaaS implementations face issues such as inconsistent performance, high operational costs, and static resource configurations, which hinder their efficiency.

Method: Saarthi introduces an input-aware framework utilizing a multi-objective ILP model for resource management, proactive fault tolerance, and smart orchestration on OpenFaaS.

Result: Saarthi showed improvements, achieving up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, and maintained 98.3% service-level targets with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Saarthi represents a step towards self-driving serverless platforms, enhancing function workloads performance and optimizing operational costs.

Abstract: FaaS offers significant advantages with its infrastructure abstraction, on-demand execution, and attractive no idle resource pricing for modern cloud applications. Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS. Our results demonstrate Saarthi's ability to achieve up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, while maintaining up to 98.3% service level targets with an overhead of up to 0.2 seconds as compared to the baseline OpenFaaS.

TL;DR: The paper explores offloading machine learning (ML) collectives to direct memory access (DMA) engines for enhanced performance and energy efficiency, particularly on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in prior studies on DMA collective methods, the paper aims to perform a detailed analysis, including power/energy, performance, and synchronization costs for offloaded ML communication collectives.

Method: The authors analyze DMA collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) using performance comparisons, power measurements, and latency breakdowns to identify inefficiencies and optimize DMA implementations.

Result: DMA collectives show superior performance (16% better) and energy efficiency (32% better) for large sizes, but lag significantly for small sizes. Optimized DMA implementations close these gaps, improving smaller size efficiencies (30% slower or 20% faster depending on the method) and large size savings slightly more (7% performance improvement).

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that optimized DMA collectives perform competitively for diverse workloads, advancing their adoption in mainstream libraries.

Abstract: Offloading machine learning (ML) communication collectives to direct memory access (DMA) engines has emerged as an interesting and low-cost solution to efficiently overlap computation and communication in inference and training. Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).
  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries.

Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face critical challenges in energy management and network lifetime optimization due to limited battery resources and communication overhead. This study introduces a novel hybrid clustering protocol that integrates the Water Strider Algorithm (WSA) with Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to achieve superior energy efficiency and network longevity. The proposed WSA-FCM method employs WSA for global optimization of cluster- head positions and FCM for refined node membership assignment with fuzzy boundaries. Through extensive experimentation across networks of 200-800 nodes with 10 independent simulation runs, the method demonstrates significant improvements: First Node Death (FND) delayed by 16.1% ($678\pm12$ vs $584\pm18$ rounds), Last Node Death (LND) extended by 11.9% ($1,262\pm8$ vs $1,128\pm11$ rounds), and 37.4% higher residual energy retention ($5.47\pm0.09$ vs $3.98\pm0.11$ J) compared to state-of-the-art hybrid methods. Intra-cluster distances are reduced by 19.4% with statistical significance (p < 0.001). Theoretical analysis proves convergence guarantees and complexity bounds of $O(n\times c\times T)$, while empirical scalability analysis demonstrates near-linear scaling behaviour. The method outperforms recent hybrid approaches including MOALO-FCM, MSSO-MST, Fuzzy+HHO, and GWO-FCM across all performance metrics with rigorous statistical validation.

### [353] [A GPU-boosted high-performance multi-working condition joint analysis framework for predicting dynamics of textured axial piston pump](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06824)
*Xin Yao,Yang Liu,Jin Jiang,Yesen Chen,Zhilong Chen,Hongkang Dong,Xiaofeng Wei,Teng Zhang,Dongyun Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a GPU-enhanced framework (GMAF) to accelerate simulations of axial piston pump (APP) dynamics, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy for textured and smooth surfaces over multiple periods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by inefficiencies in conventional iteration methods for detailed simulation scenarios, particularly for textured APPs requiring refined meshes and simulations over multiple periods.

Method: The GMAF utilizes Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) with an Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation (ASSOR) preconditioner, leveraging GPU capabilities to accelerate computations and solve joint algebraic systems for pressure fields.

Result: The framework demonstrates successful acceleration in analyzing APP dynamics, showing that textured surfaces enhance pressure capacity and torsion resistance, as observed from numerical 'steps' in pressure fields.

Conclusion: The GMAF is a robust solution for efficient APP simulation, especially for models with textured surfaces, offering insights into oil dynamics and improved design considerations for stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate simulation to dynamics of axial piston pump (APP) is essential for its design, manufacture and maintenance. However, limited by computation capacity of CPU device and traditional solvers, conventional iteration methods are inefficient in complicated case with textured surface requiring refined mesh, and could not handle simulation during multiple periods. To accelerate Picard iteration for predicting dynamics of APP, a GPU-boosted high-performance Multi-working condition joint Analysis Framework (GMAF) is designed, which adopts Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) using Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner (ASSOR). GMAF abundantly utilizes GPU device via elevating computational intensity and expanding scale of massive parallel computation. Therefore, it possesses novel performance in analyzing dynamics of both smooth and textured APPs during multiple periods, as the establishment and solution to joint algebraic system for pressure field are accelerated magnificently, as well as numerical integral for force and moment due to oil flow. Compared with asynchronized convergence strategy pursuing local convergence, synchronized convergence strategy targeting global convergence is adopted in PCG solver for the joint system. Revealed by corresponding results, oil force in axial direction and moment in circumferential directly respond to input pressure, while other components evolve in sinusoidal patterns. Specifically, force and moment due to normal pressure instantly reach their steady state initially, while ones due to viscous shear stress evolve during periods. After simulating dynamics of APP and pressure distribution via GMAF, the promotion of pressure capacity and torsion resistance due to textured surface is revealed numerically, as several 'steps' exist in the pressure field corresponding to textures.

Method: The PAIR-Agent employs a causal fault graph, Markov blankets coupled with the free-energy principle for fault identification, and active inference for autonomous self-healing.

Result: The framework demonstrates resilience through theoretical validations, maintaining service during diverse failure scenarios.

Conclusion: The PAIR-Agent successfully addresses reliability challenges in distributed computing systems with the introduced adaptive and probabilistic inference techniques.

Abstract: Failures are the norm in highly complex and heterogeneous devices spanning the distributed computing continuum (DCC), from resource-constrained IoT and edge nodes to high-performance computing systems. Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free-energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome limitations of existing simulators that lack clear abstraction for hardware integration and fail to support diverse serving approaches.

Method: The paper introduces trace-driven performance modeling with an operator-level latency profiler for effortless hardware integration, along with updated serving techniques and flexible system interfaces.

Result: The system demonstrated 18.5x fewer lines of code required for hardware profiling, high accuracy in GPU-based simulations (1.9% error), and practical simulation times.

Conclusion: LLMServingSim2.0 effectively addresses prior limitations, offering a low-effort, versatile solution for hardware extensibility and improving system simulation accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLMServingSim2.0, a system simulator designed for exploring heterogeneous hardware in large-scale LLM serving systems. LLMServingSim2.0 addresses two key limitations of its predecessor: (1) integrating hardware models into system-level simulators is non-trivial due to the lack of a clear abstraction, and (2) existing simulators support only a narrow subset of serving techniques, leaving no infrastructure that captures the breadth of approaches in modern LLM serving. To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility. Our experiments further show that LLMServingSim2.0 reproduces GPU-based LLM serving with 1.9% error, while maintaining practical simulation time, making it a comprehensive platform for both hardware developers and LLM service providers.

Conclusion: The ontology enables stakeholders to select benchmarks suited to their needs, promoting high-quality benchmarks and advancing reproducible cross-domain scientific machine learning research.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning research spans diverse domains and data modalities, yet existing benchmark efforts remain siloed and lack standardization. This makes novel and transformative applications of machine learning to critical scientific use-cases more fragmented and less clear in pathways to impact. This paper introduces an ontology for scientific benchmarking developed through a unified, community-driven effort that extends the MLCommons ecosystem to cover physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, climate science, and more. Building on prior initiatives such as XAI-BENCH, FastML Science Benchmarks, PDEBench, and the SciMLBench framework, our effort consolidates a large set of disparate benchmarks and frameworks into a single taxonomy of scientific, application, and system-level benchmarks. New benchmarks can be added through an open submission workflow coordinated by the MLCommons Science Working Group and evaluated against a six-category rating rubric that promotes and identifies high-quality benchmarks, enabling stakeholders to select benchmarks that meet their specific needs. The architecture is extensible, supporting future scientific and AI/ML motifs, and we discuss methods for identifying emerging computing patterns for unique scientific workloads. The MLCommons Science Benchmarks Ontology provides a standardized, scalable foundation for reproducible, cross-domain benchmarking in scientific machine learning. A companion webpage for this work has also been developed as the effort evolves: https://mlcommons-science.github.io/benchmark/

*Mahdi Goldani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops a daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index (ESI) using time series similarity measures and XGBoost forecasting to provide daily insights into energy security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of the annually reported Energy Security Index, which fails to respond to short-term fluctuations, by creating a daily monitoring proxy.

Method: The study used a two-stage approach: (1) six time series similarity measures were applied to key energy-related variables to find a suitable daily proxy, and (2) the proxy's performance was modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15-day forecasts.

Result: The study identified Volume Brent as the most suitable proxy, achieving high predictive performance with R-squared values of 0.981 (training) and 0.945 (testing). The forecast revealed short-term energy security fluctuations and trends over 15 days.

Conclusion: This paper provides a novel framework for turning low-frequency indicators like the Energy Security Index into high-frequency data, enabling real-time monitoring and offering policymakers a valuable tool for rapid decision-making.

Abstract: The policy environment of countries changes rapidly, influencing macro-level indicators such as the Energy Security Index. However, this index is only reported annually, limiting its responsiveness to short-term fluctuations. To address this gap, the present study introduces a daily proxy for the Energy Security Index and applies it to forecast energy security at a daily frequency.The study employs a two stage approach first, a suitable daily proxy for the annual Energy Security Index is identified by applying six time series similarity measures to key energy related variables. Second, the selected proxy is modeled using the XGBoost algorithm to generate 15 day ahead forecasts, enabling high frequency monitoring of energy security dynamics.As the result of proxy choosing, Volume Brent consistently emerged as the most suitable proxy across the majority of methods. The model demonstrated strong performance, with an R squared of 0.981 on the training set and 0.945 on the test set, and acceptable error metrics . The 15 day forecast of Brent volume indicates short term fluctuations, with a peak around day 4, a decline until day 8, a rise near day 10, and a downward trend toward day 15, accompanied by prediction intervals.By integrating time series similarity measures with machine learning based forecasting, this study provides a novel framework for converting low frequency macroeconomic indicators into high frequency, actionable signals. The approach enables real time monitoring of the Energy Security Index, offering policymakers and analysts a scalable and practical tool to respond more rapidly to fast changing policy and market conditions, especially in data scarce environments.

*Sagar Shrestha,Xiao Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Diversified Flow Matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework to improve Diversified Distribution Matching (DDM), ensuring translation identifiability and avoiding GANs' drawbacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the instability and limitations of GAN-based DDM implementations, providing a method that outputs transport trajectory information for applications like single-cell evolution and robot route planning.

Method: Introduces DFM, an ODE-based approach, utilizing a custom bilevel optimization loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and structural reformulation to enforce unified translation functions in diversified distribution matching.

Result: DFM guarantees translation identifiability within the ODE framework and demonstrates strong performance across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This work successfully adapts DDM into an ODE framework, presenting DFM as a stable and versatile approach for both theoretical guarantees and practical applications.

Abstract: Diversified distribution matching (DDM) finds a unified translation function mapping a diverse collection of conditional source distributions to their target counterparts. DDM was proposed to resolve content misalignment issues in unpaired domain translation, achieving translation identifiability. However, DDM has only been implemented using GANs due to its constraints on the translation function. GANs are often unstable to train and do not provide the transport trajectory information -- yet such trajectories are useful in applications such as single-cell evolution analysis and robot route planning. This work introduces diversified flow matching (DFM), an ODE-based framework for DDM. Adapting flow matching (FM) to enforce a unified translation function as in DDM is challenging, as FM learns the translation function's velocity rather than the translation function itself. A custom bilevel optimization-based training loss, a nonlinear interpolant, and a structural reformulation are proposed to address these challenges, offering a tangible implementation. To our knowledge, DFM is the first ODE-based approach guaranteeing translation identifiability. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IterRef introduces a test-time scaling method for discrete diffusion models, leveraging reward-guided refinement processes to improve generation quality efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration of test-time scaling for discrete diffusion models with reward-guided generation, which has been underutilized despite its potential benefits.

Method: IterRef leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions within a Multiple-Try Metropolis framework to refine misaligned states toward optimal distributions.

Result: IterRef improves reward-guided generation quality significantly, achieving superior performance especially under low compute budgets across text and image domains.

Conclusion: IterRef is an effective method for test-time scaling in discrete diffusion models, delivering consistent and striking performance improvements in reward-guided generation.

Abstract: Test-time scaling through reward-guided generation remains largely unexplored for discrete diffusion models despite its potential as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce Iterative Reward-Guided Refinement (IterRef), a novel test-time scaling method tailored to discrete diffusion that leverages reward-guided noising-denoising transitions to progressively refine misaligned intermediate states. We formalize this process within a Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) framework, proving convergence to the reward-aligned distribution. Unlike prior methods that assume the current state is already aligned with the reward distribution and only guide the subsequent transition, our approach explicitly refines each state in situ, progressively steering it toward the optimal intermediate distribution. Across both text and image domains, we evaluate IterRef on diverse discrete diffusion models and observe consistent improvements in reward-guided generation quality. In particular, IterRef achieves striking gains under low compute budgets, far surpassing prior state-of-the-art baselines.

*Sanghyun Lee,Seungryong Kim,Jongho Park,Dongmin Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), a sampling method for Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) aiming to better optimize unmasking sequences, outperforming traditional heuristics by leveraging sequence uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current masked diffusion models rely on heuristic unmasking approaches that are prone to decoding mistakes and inefficiencies, motivating the need for a robust sampling framework that avoids errors and can exploit additional test-time computation.

Method: LookUM reformulates sampling as path selection over unmasking orders using a two-component framework: a path generator to propose paths and a verifier to compute uncertainty and perform importance sampling for optimal path selection.

Result: LookUM demonstrates consistent performance improvements across six benchmarks, requiring only 2-3 paths. It achieves competitive results with reinforcement tuned models and can enhance post-trained models further, proving efficiency and versatility.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-based verification in LookUM provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning, enhancing both pre-trained and post-trained models. This framework offers notable improvements in decoding performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) as language models generate by iteratively unmasking tokens, yet their performance crucially depends on the inference time order of unmasking. Prevailing heuristics, such as confidence based sampling, are myopic: they optimize locally, fail to leverage extra test-time compute, and let early decoding mistakes cascade. We propose Lookahead Unmasking (LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path selection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external reward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by sampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the uncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to subsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking measurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to avoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six benchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate consistent performance improvements. LookUM requires only two to three paths to achieve peak performance, demonstrating remarkably efficient path selection. The consistent improvements on both LLaDA and post-trained LLaDA 1.5 are particularly striking: base LLaDA with LookUM rivals the performance of RL-tuned LLaDA 1.5, while LookUM further enhances LLaDA 1.5 itself showing that uncertainty based verification provides orthogonal benefits to reinforcement learning and underscoring the versatility of our framework. Code will be publicly released.

*Aheer Sravon,Devdyuti Mazumder,Md. Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Var-DRO, an adaptive sample-level optimization framework addressing the limitations of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). It assigns personalized robustness budgets to training samples based on online loss variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations hinder reliability in deep neural networks trained with ERM. Conventional DRO methods suffer from being overly conservative with a single global robustness budget.

Method: Var-DRO automatically identifies high-risk samples and assigns personalized robustness budgets using online loss variance. It employs KL-divergence-style bounds, stabilizing training with warmup, ramp schedules, and label smoothing.

Result: Var-DRO outperforms ERM and KL-DRO in tasks involving CIFAR-10-C corruptions, Waterbirds dataset, and exhibits competitive performance on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: Var-DRO is theoretically sound, computationally efficient, and improves robustness and overall accuracy without requiring group labels, making it highly practical.

Abstract: Distribution shifts and minority subpopulations frequently undermine the reliability of deep neural networks trained using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this by optimizing for the worst-case risk within a neighborhood of the training distribution. However, conventional methods depend on a single, global robustness budget, which can lead to overly conservative models or a misallocation of robustness. We propose a variance-driven, adaptive, sample-level DRO (Var-DRO) framework that automatically identifies high-risk training samples and assigns a personalized robustness budget to each based on its online loss variance. Our formulation employs two-sided, KL-divergence-style bounds to constrain the ratio between adversarial and empirical weights for every sample. This results in a linear inner maximization problem over a convex polytope, which admits an efficient water-filling solution. To stabilize training, we introduce a warmup phase and a linear ramp schedule for the global cap on per-sample budgets, complemented by label smoothing for numerical robustness. Evaluated on CIFAR-10-C (corruptions), our method achieves the highest overall mean accuracy compared to ERM and KL-DRO. On Waterbirds, Var-DRO improves overall performance while matching or surpassing KL-DRO. On the original CIFAR-10 dataset, Var-DRO remains competitive, exhibiting the modest trade-off anticipated when prioritizing robustness. The proposed framework is unsupervised (requiring no group labels), straightforward to implement, theoretically sound, and computationally efficient.

Result: The research demonstrates the improved predictive capabilities of data-driven models and emphasizes the benefits of incorporating additional variables in forecasting models.

Conclusion: Data-driven models outperform traditional methods, offering more accurate jet fuel demand forecasts, which can optimize supply chain operations and sourcing strategies in the aviation industry.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of jet fuel demand is crucial for optimizing supply chain operations in the aviation market. Fuel distributors specifically require precise estimates to avoid inventory shortages or excesses. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze the jet fuel demand forecasting problem using machine learning models. Instead, many industry practitioners rely on deterministic or expertise-based models. In this research, we evaluate the performance of data-driven approaches using a substantial amount of data obtained from a major aviation fuel distributor in the Danish market. Our analysis compares the predictive capabilities of traditional time series models, Prophet, LSTM sequence-to-sequence neural networks, and hybrid models. A key challenge in developing these models is the required forecasting horizon, as fuel demand needs to be predicted for the next 30 days to optimize sourcing strategies. To ensure the reliability of the data-driven approaches and provide valuable insights to practitioners, we analyze three different datasets. The primary objective of this study is to present a comprehensive case study on jet fuel demand forecasting, demonstrating the advantages of employing data-driven models and highlighting the impact of incorporating additional variables in the predictive models.

Motivation: Federated Learning struggles with the communication efficiency, especially for large-scale models, while preserving data privacy during decentralized model training.

Method: The paper proposes ProjFL and ProjFL+EF algorithms. ProjFL uses unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF utilizes biased compressors with an Error Feedback mechanism. Both algorithms project local gradients to a shared subspace spanned by historical descent directions to optimize communication.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that both algorithms achieve comparable accuracy to existing baselines while significantly reducing communication costs in FL classification tasks with deep neural networks.

Conclusion: ProjFL and ProjFL+EF offer effective solutions for reducing communication inefficiencies in Federated Learning without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple clients while optionally preserving data privacy. However, communication efficiency remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce two complementary algorithms: ProjFL, designed for unbiased compressors, and ProjFL+EF, tailored for biased compressors through an Error Feedback mechanism. Both methods rely on projecting local gradients onto a shared client-server subspace spanned by historical descent directions, enabling efficient information exchange with minimal communication overhead. We establish convergence guarantees for both algorithms under strongly convex, convex, and non-convex settings. Empirical evaluations on standard FL classification benchmarks with deep neural networks show that ProjFL and ProjFL+EF achieve accuracy comparable to existing baselines while substantially reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning using fine-tuned VLMs enhances prediction performance while reducing the need for multiple models, thereby cutting deployment and maintenance costs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks like visual question answering and multimodal text generation, but their effectiveness in scientific domains such as materials science remains limited. While some machine learning methods have addressed specific challenges in this field, there is still a lack of foundation models designed for broad tasks like polymer property prediction using multimodal data. In this work, we present a multimodal polymer dataset to fine-tune VLMs through instruction-tuning pairs and assess the impact of multimodality on prediction performance. Our fine-tuned models, using LoRA, outperform unimodal and baseline approaches, demonstrating the benefits of multimodal learning. Additionally, this approach reduces the need to train separate models for different properties, lowering deployment and maintenance costs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FH-RL, a neural mechanism that allows self-referential computation through internal feedback, improving transformer architecture functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in standard transformer architectures that lack internal recurrence, aiming to create more advanced computational models resembling recursive neural processing.

Method: FH-RL integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned feedback. Controlled experiments adjust reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate dynamics with three metrics (IRR, ESRI, RDP).

Result: Reentry increases with $γ$, with stable and structured feedback matrix at moderate gains. Reflective processing emerges around $γ ~ 0.10-0.20$, showing spectral stability and consistent cycles.

Conclusion: FH-RL enables thought-like internal computations, linking modern neural mechanisms to cognitive theories through calibrated feedback and regulation.

Abstract: This study introduces the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Layer (FH-RL), a neural mechanism that integrates fast-weight associative memory, homeostatic regularization, and learned reentrant feedback to approximate self-referential computation in neural networks. Unlike standard transformer architectures that operate in a purely feedforward manner during inference, FH-RL enables internal recurrence without external looping, allowing prior latent states to be dynamically re-entered into the ongoing computation stream. We conduct controlled experiments sweeping the reentry gain $γ$ and evaluate emergent internal dynamics using three novel metrics: the Information Reentry Ratio (IRR), Eigen-Spectrum Recursion Index (ESRI), and Representational Drift Periodicity (RDP). Results show that reentry quantity increases proportionally with~$γ$, while the learned feedback matrix $W_r$ remains bounded and becomes more structured at moderate gains. Critically, a stable reflective band emerges around $γ\approx 0.10-0.20$, where internal feedback is maximally expressive yet spectrally stable: IRR rises smoothly, ESRI remains near zero, and RDP exhibits consistent low-frequency cycles. These findings provide quantitative evidence that reflective, thought-like internal processing can arise from a principled balance between feedback amplification and homeostatic regulation, linking modern fast-weight architectures to theories of cortical reentry and recursive cognition.

However, two key challenges remain: (i) the need for accurate estimation of traffic quality together with sufficiently high confidence in the model's predictions, typically addressed through uncertainty modeling, and (ii) the efficiency bottlenecks that such uncertainty modeling introduces in real-time applications due to repeated inference. To address these challenges, we propose DAUM, a joint modeling framework that integrates multi-objective learning with uncertainty modeling, yielding both traffic quality predictions and reliable confidence estimates. Building on DAUM, we further apply knowledge distillation to reduce the computational overhead of uncertainty modeling, while largely preserving predictive accuracy and retaining the benefits of uncertainty estimation. Experiments on the JD advertisement dataset demonstrate that DAUM consistently improves predictive performance, with the distilled model delivering a tenfold increase in inference speed.

### [368] [Fooling Algorithms in Non-Stationary Bandits using Belief Inertia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05620)
*Gal Mendelson,Eyal Tadmor*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new belief inertia argument to analyze lower bounds on regret in non-stationary bandits, highlighting that certain algorithms suffer linear regret with substantial constants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of understanding worst-case regret in time-varying multi-armed bandit settings, where current lower bounds are insufficient.

Method: The paper employs a belief inertia argument, showing how historical reward averages resist updates when changes occur, and constructs adversarial instances to expose vulnerabilities in classical bandit algorithms.

Result: The analysis proves that classical algorithms like Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, UCB, and even restarting strategies can suffer linear regret with T and significant constant factors.

Conclusion: Belief inertia offers a robust framework for establishing sharper lower bounds in non-stationary bandits, suggesting a need to rethink algorithmic strategies in these settings.

Abstract: We study the problem of worst case regret in piecewise stationary multi armed bandits. While the minimax theory for stationary bandits is well established, understanding analogous limits in time-varying settings is challenging. Existing lower bounds rely on what we refer to as infrequent sampling arguments, where long intervals without exploration allow adversarial reward changes that induce large regret.
  In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach based on a belief inertia argument. Our analysis captures how an algorithm's empirical beliefs, encoded through historical reward averages, create momentum that resists new evidence after a change. We show how this inertia can be exploited to construct adversarial instances that mislead classical algorithms such as Explore Then Commit, epsilon greedy, and UCB, causing them to suffer regret that grows linearly with T and with a substantial constant factor, regardless of how their parameters are tuned, even with a single change point.
  We extend the analysis to algorithms that periodically restart to handle non stationarity and prove that, even then, the worst case regret remains linear in T. Our results indicate that utilizing belief inertia can be a powerful method for deriving sharp lower bounds in non stationary bandits.

*Yong-Ming Tian,Shuang Liang,Shao-Qun Zhang,Feng-Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a depth-induced neural tangent kernel (NTK) to better understand the role of depth in neural networks and extends neural kernel theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing NTK frameworks, which focus on infinite-width networks while neglecting the representational importance of network depth.

Method: The authors introduce a depth-induced NTK based on a shortcut-related architecture and analyze its theoretical properties like training invariance and spectrum stability.

Result: The proposed kernel avoids degeneration, stabilizes kernel dynamics, and achieves effective representation learning, supported by experimental validations.

Conclusion: The work broadens the theoretical understanding of deep learning by incorporating depth into NTK theory, offering insights into scaling behavior and enhancing neural kernel modeling.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, its theoretical understanding of representation learning remains limited. Deep neural kernels provide a principled framework to interpret over-parameterized neural networks by mapping hierarchical feature transformations into kernel spaces, thereby combining the expressive power of deep architectures with the analytical tractability of kernel methods. Recent advances, particularly neural tangent kernels (NTKs) derived by gradient inner products, have established connections between infinitely wide neural networks and nonparametric Bayesian inference. However, the existing NTK paradigm has been predominantly confined to the infinite-width regime, while overlooking the representational role of network depth. To address this gap, we propose a depth-induced NTK kernel based on a shortcut-related architecture, which converges to a Gaussian process as the network depth approaches infinity. We theoretically analyze the training invariance and spectrum properties of the proposed kernel, which stabilizes the kernel dynamics and mitigates degeneration. Experimental results further underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings significantly extend the existing landscape of the neural kernel theory and provide an in-depth understanding of deep learning and the scaling law.

### [370] [Prompting Neural-Guided Equation Discovery Based on Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05586)
*Jannis Brugger,Viktor Pfanschilling,David Richter,Mira Mezini,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RED, a method to iteratively improve generated equations in equation discovery systems by leveraging residuals of subequations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural-guided equation discovery systems are limited in offering alternative solutions or improvements if their predictions do not meet user expectations, requiring intensive interaction to refine results.

Method: RED uses residuals of subequations to suggest improvements. It parses the initial equation as a syntax tree, computes residuals for subequations, uses them as a new target variable, and prompts the equation discovery system to propose a better subequation.

Result: Experiments using 53 equations from the Feynman benchmark show it enhances both neural-guided and classical genetic programming systems' performance.

Conclusion: RED is a versatile and efficient post-processing method to refine equations for any equation discovery system, demonstrating adaptability and effectiveness in boosting system results.

Abstract: Neural-guided equation discovery systems use a data set as prompt and predict an equation that describes the data set without extensive search. However, if the equation does not meet the user's expectations, there are few options for getting other equation suggestions without intensive work with the system. To fill this gap, we propose Residuals for Equation Discovery (RED), a post-processing method that improves a given equation in a targeted manner, based on its residuals. By parsing the initial equation to a syntax tree, we can use node-based calculation rules to compute the residual for each subequation of the initial equation. It is then possible to use this residual as new target variable in the original data set and generate a new prompt. If, with the new prompt, the equation discovery system suggests a subequation better than the old subequation on a validation set, we replace the latter by the former. RED is usable with any equation discovery system, is fast to calculate, and is easy to extend for new mathematical operations. In experiments on 53 equations from the Feynman benchmark, we show that it not only helps to improve all tested neural-guided systems, but also all tested classical genetic programming systems.

*Hamza Virk,Sandro Amaglobeli,Zuhayr Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Blind-IGT, a statistical framework for recovering agent parameters ($θ$ and $τ$) in competitive settings while resolving scale ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scale ambiguity issue that arises in competitive games when agents' rationality parameters are unknown, affecting statistical identifiability.

Method: A normalization constraint resolves scale ambiguity, alongside a Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator for recovering parameters with optimal convergence rates.

Result: Efficient recovery of parameters $θ$ and $τ$ with optimal statistical convergence; extended framework for Markov games showing robust empirical performance.

Conclusion: Blind-IGT provides a robust solution for inverse game theory problems, ensuring identifiability and optimal parameter recovery even in complex Markov game settings.

Abstract: Inverse Game Theory (IGT) methods based on the entropy-regularized Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) offer a tractable approach for competitive settings, but critically assume the agents' rationality parameter (temperature $τ$) is known a priori. When $τ$ is unknown, a fundamental scale ambiguity emerges that couples $τ$ with the reward parameters ($θ$), making them statistically unidentifiable. We introduce Blind-IGT, the first statistical framework to jointly recover both $θ$ and $τ$ from observed behavior. We analyze this bilinear inverse problem and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unique identification by introducing a normalization constraint that resolves the scale ambiguity. We propose an efficient Normalized Least Squares (NLS) estimator and prove it achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ convergence rate for joint parameter recovery. When strong identifiability conditions fail, we provide partial identification guarantees through confidence set construction. We extend our framework to Markov games and demonstrate optimal convergence rates with strong empirical performance even when transition dynamics are unknown.

*Zekai Qu,Yinxu Pan,Ao Sun,Chaojun Xiao,Xu Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPRIS, an RL method for LLMs that enhances training efficiency by addressing rollout inefficiencies and applying importance sampling corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional synchronous RL systems for LLMs suffer from inefficiencies caused by long trajectories, leading to idle computational resources and slower training processes.

Method: CoPRIS employs concurrent rollouts with early termination, reuses unfinished trajectories, and implements cross-stage importance sampling corrections to improve efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrated up to 1.94x faster training compared to synchronous RL systems while maintaining or improving performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoPRIS offers a scalable and efficient RL paradigm for LLMs, addressing inefficiencies and achieving faster training without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has become a trending paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Most existing RL systems for LLMs operate in a fully synchronous manner, where training must wait for the rollout of an entire batch to complete. This design leads to severe inefficiencies, as extremely long trajectories can stall the entire rollout process and leave many GPUs idle. To address this issue, we propose Concurrency- Controlled Partial Rollout with Importance Sampling (CoPRIS), which mitigates long-tail inefficiencies by maintaining a fixed number of concurrent rollouts, early-terminating once sufficient samples are collected, and reusing unfinished trajectories in subsequent rollouts. To mitigate the impact of off-policy trajectories, we introduce Cross-stage Importance Sampling Correction, which concatenates buffered log probabilities from the previous policy with those recomputed under the current policy for importance sampling correction. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CoPRIS achieves up to 1.94x faster training while maintaining comparable or superior performance to synchronous RL systems. The code of CoPRIS is available at https://github.com/777pomingzi/CoPRIS.

### [373] [Catching Contamination Before Generation: Spectral Kill Switches for Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05804)
*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diagnostic approach for detecting errors in multi-step language model reasoning chains by analyzing attention-induced token graphs during early stages of execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent error propagation in agentic language models caused by context inconsistencies, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, as post hoc evaluations often occur too late.

Method: The diagnostic computes two spectral statistics in the early layers of language models: the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy, leveraging these to emit binary accept/reject signals in real-time during model execution.

Result: Empirical results show the high frequency energy ratio is robustly bimodal across various model families, enabling effective and efficient gating decisions with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: This approach provides a real-time mechanism to prevent error propagation in language models, supporting safer and more accurate deployments in applications such as retrieval-augmented pipelines.

Abstract: Agentic language models compose multi step reasoning chains, yet intermediate steps can be corrupted by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, which makes post hoc evaluation too late because errors propagate before detection. We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.

*Chaimaa Medjadji,Sadi Alawadi,Feras M. Awaysheh,Guilain Leduc,Sylvain Kubler,Yves Le Traon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Learning faces high communication overhead; this paper introduces FedSparQ, a compression framework optimizing gradient exchanges while retaining or improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant communication overhead in Federated Learning caused by frequent high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks.

Method: The paper proposes FedSparQ, which dynamically sparsifies gradients using an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization, and integrates error feedback for preserving information without manual tuning, adaptable across different data distributions and architectures.

Result: FedSparQ reduces communication overhead by 90%, improves model accuracy by 6%, and enhances convergence by 50% compared to FedAvg and other baselines, as tested on vision benchmarks with IID and non-IID data.

Conclusion: FedSparQ provides a robust, efficient solution for bandwidth-restricted Federated Learning scenarios, setting a foundation for further advancements in adaptive precision and privacy protocols.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy by keeping raw data local. However, FL suffers from significant communication overhead due to the frequent exchange of high-dimensional model updates over constrained networks. In this paper, we present FedSparQ, a lightweight compression framework that dynamically sparsifies the gradient of each client through an adaptive threshold, applies half-precision quantization to retained entries and integrates residuals from error feedback to prevent loss of information. FedSparQ requires no manual tuning of sparsity rates or quantization schedules, adapts seamlessly to both homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions, and is agnostic to model architecture. Through extensive empirical evaluation on vision benchmarks under independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data, we show that FedSparQ substantially reduces communication overhead (reducing by 90% of bytes sent compared to FedAvg) while preserving or improving model accuracy (improving by 6% compared to FedAvg non-compressed solution or to state-of-the-art compression models) and enhancing convergence robustness (by 50%, compared to the other baselines). Our approach provides a practical, easy-to-deploy solution for bandwidth-constrained federated deployments and lays the groundwork for future extensions in adaptive precision and privacy-preserving protocols.

*Taixi Chen,Yiu-ming Cheung,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new distance metric for clustering categorical data is proposed, which adapts to varying attribute distributions in clusters. It also supports mixed data clustering and shows strong performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation in existing clustering methods for categorical data, where distance measures fail to account for varying distributions across clusters, leading to inaccurate results.

Method: The method involves creating a cluster-customized distance metric that adapts distances based on each cluster's attribute distributions. The approach is also extended to handle mixed data (numerical and categorical).

Result: The proposed distance metric achieved top performance in clustering on fourteen datasets, as demonstrated experimentally.

Conclusion: The study introduces an effective solution for categorical and mixed data clustering, offering superior accuracy through a cluster-specific adaptive distance metric.

Abstract: An appropriate distance metric is crucial for categorical data clustering, as the distance between categorical data cannot be directly calculated. However, the distances between attribute values usually vary in different clusters induced by their different distributions, which has not been taken into account, thus leading to unreasonable distance measurement. Therefore, we propose a cluster-customized distance metric for categorical data clustering, which can competitively update distances based on different distributions of attributes in each cluster. In addition, we extend the proposed distance metric to the mixed data that contains both numerical and categorical attributes. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, i.e., achieving an average ranking of around first in fourteen datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAVER, a framework for stabilizing few-shot fine-tuning in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) by using generative augmentations to tackle instabilities in domain and task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Foundation Models face instability during few-shot fine-tuning due to random support sample selection and structural differences between pre-trained and target graphs. The aim is to enable more robust, efficient, and trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks.

Method: The GRAVER framework identifies transferable subgraph patterns via ego-graph disentanglement, constructs universal graph vocabularies using graphon-based generative experts, and uses in-context vocabularies for lightweight and efficient prompt fine-tuning using a MoE-CoE network.

Result: GRAVER demonstrates superior performance, robustness, and efficiency compared to 15 state-of-the-art baselines on few-shot node and graph classification tasks.

Conclusion: GRAVER enhances the stability and efficiency of fine-tuning GFMs, providing a robust approach for transferring knowledge across different domains and tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of foundation models in language and vision, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) hold significant promise for broad applicability across diverse graph tasks and domains. However, existing GFMs struggle with unstable few-shot fine-tuning, where both performance and adaptation efficiency exhibit significant fluctuations caused by the randomness in the support sample selection and structural discrepancies between the pre-trained and target graphs. How to fine-tune GFMs robustly and efficiently to enable trustworthy knowledge transfer across domains and tasks is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose GRAVER, a novel Generative gRAph VocabulariEs for Robust GFM fine-tuning framework that tackles the aforementioned instability via generative augmentations. Specifically, to identify transferable units, we analyze and extract key class-specific subgraph patterns by ego-graph disentanglement and validate their transferability both theoretically and empirically. To enable effective pre-training across diverse domains, we leverage a universal task template based on ego-graph similarity and construct graph vocabularies via graphon-based generative experts. To facilitate robust and efficient prompt fine-tuning, we grave the support samples with in-context vocabularies, where the lightweight MoE-CoE network attentively routes knowledge from source domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GRAVER over effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency on downstream few-shot node and graph classification tasks compared with 15 state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: FiCABU is a software-hardware co-design for efficient machine unlearning in edge AI devices, ensuring accuracy preservation and energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the increasing need for machine unlearning due to privacy regulations and computational constraints at the edge, where traditional methods are impractical.

Method: FiCABU utilizes Context-Adaptive Unlearning and Balanced Dampening techniques, implemented in a RISC-V edge AI processor. It leverages Fisher estimation and a GEMM-centric pipeline, validated on FPGA prototypes and synthesized in 45 nm for analysis.

Result: FiCABU achieves significant computation and energy reductions while maintaining accuracy comparable to traditional methods such as SSD baseline. It ensures random-guess forget accuracy and improved retain accuracy across various hardware and datasets.

Conclusion: FiCABU establishes an efficient, practical solution for machine unlearning in edge AI, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments while addressing privacy concerns effectively.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, driven by privacy regulations and the "right to be forgotten", is increasingly needed at the edge, yet server-centric or retraining-heavy methods are impractical under tight computation and energy budgets. We present FiCABU (Fisher-based Context-Adaptive Balanced Unlearning), a software-hardware co-design that brings unlearning to edge AI processors. FiCABU combines (i) Context-Adaptive Unlearning, which begins edits from back-end layers and halts once the target forgetting is reached, with (ii) Balanced Dampening, which scales dampening strength by depth to preserve retain accuracy. These methods are realized in a full RTL design of a RISC-V edge AI processor that integrates two lightweight IPs for Fisher estimation and dampening into a GEMM-centric streaming pipeline, validated on an FPGA prototype and synthesized in 45 nm for power analysis. Across CIFAR-20 and PinsFaceRecognition with ResNet-18 and ViT, FiCABU achieves random-guess forget accuracy while matching the retraining-free Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD) baseline on retain accuracy, reducing computation by up to 87.52 percent (ResNet-18) and 71.03 percent (ViT). On the INT8 hardware prototype, FiCABU further improves retain preservation and reduces energy to 6.48 percent (CIFAR-20) and 0.13 percent (PinsFaceRecognition) of the SSD baseline. In sum, FiCABU demonstrates that back-end-first, depth-aware unlearning can be made both practical and efficient for resource-constrained edge AI devices.

Abstract: In the era of smart manufacturing, predictive maintenance (PdM) plays a pivotal role in improving equipment reliability and reducing operating costs. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that integrates advanced soft computing techniques - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) - to address the multidimensional challenges of predictive maintenance in complex manufacturing systems. Specifically, the proposed framework innovatively combines the powerful frequency-domain representation capability of FNOs to capture high-dimensional temporal patterns; DAEs to achieve robust, noise-resistant latent state embedding from complex non-Gaussian sensor data; and GNNs to accurately represent inter-device dependencies for coordinated system-wide maintenance decisions. Furthermore, by exploiting PPO, the framework ensures stable and efficient optimisation of long-term maintenance strategies to effectively handle uncertainty and non-stationary dynamics. Experimental validation demonstrates that the approach significantly outperforms multiple deep learning baseline models with up to 13% cost reduction, as well as strong convergence and inter-module synergy. The framework has considerable industrial potential to effectively reduce downtime and operating expenses through data-driven strategies.

Result: Surrogate models introduced in the paper accurately predict latency and resource usage within several percent for the 75th percentile of the test dataset.

Conclusion: The benchmark and models facilitate improved resource and latency estimation for ML accelerators, supporting faster iteration and design optimization for scientific applications.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented in hardware to address real-time challenges in scientific applications, the development of advanced toolchains has significantly reduced the time required to iterate on various designs. These advancements have solved major obstacles, but also exposed new challenges. For example, processes that were not previously considered bottlenecks, such as hardware synthesis, are becoming limiting factors in the rapid iteration of designs. To mitigate these emerging constraints, multiple efforts have been undertaken to develop an ML-based surrogate model that estimates resource usage of ML accelerator architectures. We introduce wa-hls4ml, a benchmark for ML accelerator resource and latency estimation, and its corresponding initial dataset of over 680,000 fully connected and convolutional neural networks, all synthesized using hls4ml and targeting Xilinx FPGAs. The benchmark evaluates the performance of resource and latency predictors against several common ML model architectures, primarily originating from scientific domains, as exemplar models, and the average performance across a subset of the dataset. Additionally, we introduce GNN- and transformer-based surrogate models that predict latency and resources for ML accelerators. We present the architecture and performance of the models and find that the models generally predict latency and resources for the 75% percentile within several percent of the synthesized resources on the synthetic test dataset.

*Zhijing Ye,Sheng Di,Jiamin Wang,Zhiqing Zhong,Zhaorui Zhang,Xiaodong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) framework tailored for federated learning (FL) gradient data, achieving higher compression ratios and reduced communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EBLC methods like SZ are ineffective for FL gradient data due to the low smoothness and weak spatial correlation of the gradients, resulting in poor compression ratios.

Method: The paper introduces a new EBLC framework with an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations in FL training rounds and structural regularities in convolutional kernels. It uses a cross-round magnitude predictor and a sign predictor.

Result: The proposed EBLC approach achieves up to 1.53x higher compression ratios compared to SZ3 and significantly lowers accuracy loss. Integrated into APPFL, it reduces communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under constrained bandwidth scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed EBLC framework successfully addresses gradient compression challenges in FL, enhancing scalability and efficiency for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without exposing clients' private data, but its deployment is often constrained by the communication cost of transmitting gradients between clients and the central server, especially under system heterogeneity where low-bandwidth clients bottleneck overall performance. Lossy compression of gradient data can mitigate this overhead, and error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) is particularly appealing for its fine-grained utility-compression tradeoff. However, existing EBLC methods (e.g., SZ), originally designed for smooth scientific data with strong spatial locality, rely on generic predictors such as Lorenzo and interpolation for entropy reduction to improve compression ratio. Gradient tensors, in contrast, exhibit low smoothness and weak spatial correlation, rendering these predictors ineffective and leading to poor compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose an EBLC framework tailored for FL gradient data to achieve high compression ratios while preserving model accuracy. The core of it is an innovative prediction mechanism that exploits temporal correlations across FL training rounds and structural regularities within convolutional kernels to reduce residual entropy. The predictor is compatible with standard quantizers and entropy coders and comprises (1) a cross-round magnitude predictor based on a normalized exponential moving average, and (2) a sign predictor that leverages gradient oscillation and kernel-level sign consistency. Experiments show that this new EBLC yields up to 1.53x higher compression ratios than SZ3 with lower accuracy loss. Integrated into a real-world FL framework, APPFL, it reduces end-to-end communication time by 76.1%-96.2% under various constrained-bandwidth scenarios, demonstrating strong scalability for real-world FL deployments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FlowNet, a physics-inspired architecture to model dynamic spatio-temporal systems using flow-mediated token exchange and conservation principles, showing superior performance across multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adequately model asymmetric flow exchanges and dynamic systems governed by conservation principles, necessitating a physics-informed approach.

Method: FlowNet employs flow tokens for interaction transfers, conserves state redistribution via Flow Allocation Modules, adjusts relevance with Adaptive Spatial Masking, and uses a cascaded design for scalability and complexity.

Result: FlowNet achieves significant improvements on seven metrics across three real-world systems compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The work establishes a methodology based on spatio-temporal flow interactions for more efficient and physically interpretable modeling of complex systems.

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex dynamic spatio-temporal systems requires capturing flow-mediated interdependencies and context-sensitive interaction dynamics. Existing methods, predominantly graph-based or attention-driven, rely on similarity-driven connectivity assumptions, neglecting asymmetric flow exchanges that govern system evolution. We propose Spatio-Temporal Flow, a physics-inspired paradigm that explicitly models dynamic node couplings through quantifiable flow transfers governed by conservation principles. Building on this, we design FlowNet, a novel architecture leveraging flow tokens as information carriers to simulate source-to-destination transfers via Flow Allocation Modules, ensuring state redistribution aligns with conservation laws. FlowNet dynamically adjusts the interaction radius through an Adaptive Spatial Masking module, suppressing irrelevant noise while enabling context-aware propagation. A cascaded architecture enhances scalability and nonlinear representation capacity. Experiments demonstrate that FlowNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on seven metrics in the modeling of three real-world systems, validating its efficiency and physical interpretability. We establish a principled methodology for modeling complex systems through spatio-temporal flow interactions.

### [383] [Sparse Linear Regression is Easy on Random Supports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06211)
*Gautam Chandrasekaran,Raghu Meka,Konstantinos Stavropoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses sparse linear regression, proposing a new method to achieve computation and sample efficiency with certain random signal conditions and worst-case design matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational and sample efficiency gap in sparse linear regression, which aims to predict sparse signals with minimal prediction error using design matrices.

Method: The paper introduces an approach where the support of the sparse signal is chosen randomly, achieving small prediction error with polynomial samples and runtime for worst-case design matrices.

Result: The method achieves $	ext{poly}(k, \\log d, 1/ε)$ samples and polynomial runtime for any design matrix $X$ with reasonable condition numbers.

Conclusion: The paper bridges the gap between exponential runtime and efficient sample complexity for sparse linear regression under specific randomness in sparse signal support.

Abstract: Sparse linear regression is one of the most basic questions in machine learning and statistics. Here, we are given as input a design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ and measurements or labels ${y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ where ${y} = {X} {w}^* + ξ$, and $ξ$ is the noise in the measurements. Importantly, we have the additional constraint that the unknown signal vector ${w}^*$ is sparse: it has $k$ non-zero entries where $k$ is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Our goal is to output a prediction vector $\widehat{w}$ that has small prediction error: $\frac{1}{N}\cdot \|{X} {w}^* - {X} \widehat{w}\|^2_2$.
  Information-theoretically, we know what is best possible in terms of measurements: under most natural noise distributions, we can get prediction error at most $ε$ with roughly $N = O(k \log d/ε)$ samples. Computationally, this currently needs $d^{Ω(k)}$ run-time. Alternately, with $N = O(d)$, we can get polynomial-time. Thus, there is an exponential gap (in the dependence on $d$) between the two and we do not know if it is possible to get $d^{o(k)}$ run-time and $o(d)$ samples.
  We give the first generic positive result for worst-case design matrices ${X}$: For any ${X}$, we show that if the support of ${w}^*$ is chosen at random, we can get prediction error $ε$ with $N = \text{poly}(k, \log d, 1/ε)$ samples and run-time $\text{poly}(d,N)$. This run-time holds for any design matrix ${X}$ with condition number up to $2^{\text{poly}(d)}$.
  Previously, such results were known for worst-case ${w}^*$, but only for random design matrices from well-behaved families, matrices that have a very low condition number ($\text{poly}(\log d)$; e.g., as studied in compressed sensing), or those with special structural properties.

Conclusion: AutoHood3D facilitates physics-aware ML development, accelerates design iteration via generative approaches, and offers reproducible workflows. The novel dataset serves as a benchmark platform for future research in fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems.

Abstract: This study presents a new high-fidelity multi-modal dataset containing 16000+ geometric variants of automotive hoods useful for machine learning (ML) applications such as engineering component design and process optimization, and multiphysics system surrogates. The dataset is centered on a practical multiphysics problem-hood deformation from fluid entrapment and inertial loading during rotary-dip painting. Each hood is numerically modeled with a coupled Large-Eddy Simulation (LES)-Finite Element Analysis (FEA), using 1.2M cells in total to ensure spatial and temporal accuracy. The dataset provides time-resolved physical fields, along with STL meshes and structured natural language prompts for text-to-geometry synthesis. Existing datasets are either confined to 2D cases, exhibit limited geometric variations, or lack the multi-modal annotations and data structures - shortcomings we address with AutoHood3D. We validate our numerical methodology, establish quantitative baselines across five neural architectures, and demonstrate systematic surrogate errors in displacement and force predictions. These findings motivate the design of novel approaches and multiphysics loss functions that enforce fluid-solid coupling during model training. By providing fully reproducible workflows, AutoHood3D enables physics-aware ML development, accelerates generative-design iteration, and facilitates the creation of new FSI benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist electronic design automation (EDA) in improving both the quality and efficiency of chip design. But current AI for EDA (AI-EDA) infrastructures remain fragmented, lacking comprehensive solutions for the entire data pipeline from design execution to AI integration. Key challenges include fragmented flow engines that generate raw data, heterogeneous file formats for data exchange, non-standardized data extraction methods, and poorly organized data storage. This work introduces a unified open-source library for EDA (AiEDA) that addresses these issues. AiEDA integrates multiple design-to-vector data representation techniques that transform diverse chip design data into universal multi-level vector representations, establishing an AI-aided design (AAD) paradigm optimized for AI-EDA workflows. AiEDA provides complete physical design flows with programmatic data extraction and standardized Python interfaces bridging EDA datasets and AI frameworks. Leveraging the AiEDA library, we generate iDATA, a 600GB dataset of structured data derived from 50 real chip designs (28nm), and validate its effectiveness through seven representative AAD tasks spanning prediction, generation, optimization and analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/OSCC-Project/AiEDA, while the full iDATA dataset is being prepared for public release, providing a foundation for future AI-EDA research.

Result: Evaluated in Alibaba Cloud Service production, KAT achieved over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, narrowing diagnostic scope and enhancing troubleshooting efficiency and success rate.

Conclusion: KAT addresses LMDI troubleshooting challenges through precise detection and systematic analysis, demonstrating significant improvement in anomaly detection accuracy and diagnostic processes.

Abstract: Anomaly troubleshooting for large model distributed inference (LMDI) remains a critical challenge. Resolving anomalies such as inference performance degradation or latency jitter in distributed system demands significant manual efforts from domain experts, resulting in extremely time-consuming diagnosis processes with relatively low accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Kunlun Anomaly Troubleshooter (KAT), the first anomaly troubleshooting framework tailored for LMDI. KAT addresses this problem through two core innovations. First, KAT exploits the synchronicity and consistency of GPU workers, innovatively leverages function trace data to precisely detect kernel-level anomalies and associated hardware components at nanosecond resolution. Second, KAT integrates these detection results into a domain-adapted LLM, delivering systematic causal reasoning and natural language interpretation of complex anomaly symptoms. Evaluations conducted in Alibaba Cloud Service production environment indicate that KAT achieves over 0.884 precision and 0.936 recall in anomaly detection, providing detail anomaly insights that significantly narrow down the diagnostic scope and improve both the efficiency and success rate of troubleshooting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations of flexible electronics, such as high power consumption and limited gate count, which hinder on-body healthcare classification. They aim for energy-efficient, conformable healthcare devices.

Method: The authors developed a flexible RISC-V processor with an optimized multiply-accumulate co-processor. They also tackled constrained programming to select constants and map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) operations for compact hardware suited to flexible electronics.

Result: Post-layout tests showed near-real-time performance across healthcare datasets, operating within flexible battery power limits, occupying only 2.42 mm^2, and achieving 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to predecessors.

Conclusion: This innovation shows promise in making healthcare wearables more accessible, energy-efficient, and sustainable with better performance and smaller footprint.

Abstract: Flexible electronics offer unique advantages for conformable, lightweight, and disposable healthcare wearables. However, their limited gate count, large feature sizes, and high static power consumption make on-body machine learning classification highly challenging. While existing bendable RISC-V systems provide compact solutions, they lack the energy efficiency required. We present a mechanically flexible RISC-V that integrates a bespoke multiply-accumulate co-processor with fixed coefficients to maximize energy efficiency and minimize latency. Our approach formulates a constrained programming problem to jointly determine co-processor constants and optimally map Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) inference operations, enabling compact, model-specific hardware by leveraging the low fabrication and non-recurring engineering costs of flexible technologies. Post-layout results demonstrate near-real-time performance across several healthcare datasets, with our circuits operating within the power budget of existing flexible batteries and occupying only 2.42 mm^2, offering a promising path toward accessible, sustainable, and conformable healthcare wearables. Our microprocessors achieve an average 2.35x speedup and 2.15x lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why overfitting occurs in models using large-scale sparse categorical features and introduces an adaptive regularization method to solve it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address 'one-epoch overfitting' in CTR and CVR estimation models that arises from large-scale sparse categorical features in domains like advertising and recommendation.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical analysis to reveal the cause of overfitting and propose an adaptive regularization technique to tackle the issue.

Result: The method mitigates overfitting during multi-epoch training, enhances performance within one epoch, and has been successfully implemented in production systems.

Conclusion: Adaptive regularization effectively solves the performance degradation problem in CTR/CVR models, boosting reliability and deployment success in practical systems.

Abstract: The one-epoch overfitting problem has drawn widespread attention, especially in CTR and CVR estimation models in search, advertising, and recommendation domains. These models which rely heavily on large-scale sparse categorical features, often suffer a significant decline in performance when trained for multiple epochs. Although recent studies have proposed heuristic solutions, they have not clearly identified the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis that explains why overfitting occurs in models that use large-scale sparse categorical features. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive regularization method to address it. Our approach not only prevents the severe performance degradation observed during multi-epoch training, but also improves model performance within a single epoch. This method has already been deployed in online production systems.

*Mohammadhossein Homaei,Oscar Mogollon Gutierrez,Ruben Molano,Andres Caro,Mar Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive method for Digital Twins in Water Distribution Networks to enhance state estimation using LSTM and Conformal Prediction, achieving better accuracy and efficiency compared to uniform sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Digital Twins for Water Distribution Networks face inefficiencies in sensor resource deployment due to uniform sampling, which fails to address varying uncertainty across nodes.

Method: An adaptive framework combines LSTM forecasting and Marginal Conformal Prediction to estimate node-wise uncertainty dynamically. This framework allocates sensing resources to the nodes with the highest uncertainty, aiming for real-time application.

Result: The proposed method reduces demand error by 33-34% compared to uniform sampling at 40% sensor coverage while sustaining high empirical coverage (89.4-90.2%) with only 5-10% additional computational cost.

Conclusion: This adaptive framework effectively optimizes resource use for accurate state estimation in Digital Twins for Water Networks, offering significant improvements over uniform sampling methods.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) for Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) require accurate state estimation with limited sensors. Uniform sampling often wastes resources across nodes with different uncertainty. We propose an adaptive framework combining LSTM forecasting and Conformal Prediction (CP) to estimate node-wise uncertainty and focus sensing on the most uncertain points. Marginal CP is used for its low computational cost, suitable for real-time DTs. Experiments on Hanoi, Net3, and CTOWN show 33-34% lower demand error than uniform sampling at 40% coverage and maintain 89.4-90.2% empirical coverage with only 5-10% extra computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing context length in LLMs leads to inefficient GPU use due to performance bottlenecks in the Key-Value cache.

Method: Introduced MoSKA, using Shared KV Attention to optimize processing of shared context data with a sparse attention strategy and specialized hardware.

Result: Achieved a throughput improvement of up to 538.7x over existing methods in workloads with high context sharing.

Conclusion: MoSKA provides a scalable approach to optimize LLM inference, addressing context length inefficiencies and improving throughput.

Abstract: The escalating context length in Large Language Models (LLMs) creates a severe performance bottleneck around the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose memory-bound nature leads to significant GPU under-utilization. This paper introduces Mixture of Shared KV Attention (MoSKA), an architecture that addresses this challenge by exploiting the heterogeneity of context data. It differentiates between per-request unique and massively reused shared sequences. The core of MoSKA is a novel Shared KV Attention mechanism that transforms the attention on shared data from a series of memory-bound GEMV operations into a single, compute-bound GEMM by batching concurrent requests. This is supported by an MoE-inspired sparse attention strategy that prunes the search space and a tailored Disaggregated Infrastructure that specializes hardware for unique and shared data. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 538.7x over baselines in workloads with high context sharing, offering a clear architectural path toward scalable LLM inference.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to efficiently certify probabilistic robustness guarantees for classification algorithms, overcoming the limitations of traditional verification and sampling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adversarial robustness suffer from limitations—formal verification is computationally intractable, and sampling-based methods do not provide formal guarantees.

Method: The proposed method leverages a probabilistic framework by sampling an $ε$-net and using a local robustness oracle on these samples. This approach ensures efficiency and scalability.

Result: The method is independent of input dimensions, learning algorithms, and class counts, allowing application to large neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate better robustness characterization than sampling-based approaches while being more scalable than formal methods.

Conclusion: The proposed technique provides a practical, efficient, and scalable solution for certifying adversarial robustness, making it applicable to complex neural networks.

Abstract: We propose and investigate probabilistic guarantees for the adversarial robustness of classification algorithms. While traditional formal verification approaches for robustness are intractable and sampling-based approaches do not provide formal guarantees, our approach is able to efficiently certify a probabilistic relaxation of robustness. The key idea is to sample an $ε$-net and invoke a local robustness oracle on the sample. Remarkably, the size of the sample needed to achieve probably approximately global robustness guarantees is independent of the input dimensionality, the number of classes, and the learning algorithm itself. Our approach can, therefore, be applied even to large neural networks that are beyond the scope of traditional formal verification. Experiments empirically confirm that it characterizes robustness better than state-of-the-art sampling-based approaches and scales better than formal methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses fairness in link prediction tasks in graph machine learning by pointing out limitations of current fairness evaluations and proposing better methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fairness methods in link prediction fail to detect biases and do not suit ranking-based tasks.

Method: A framework for expressive fairness assessment and a lightweight post-processing method paired with decoupled link predictors.

Result: The proposed method mitigates bias effectively and achieves optimal fairness-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: The paper redefines fairness assessment in link prediction and provides improved solutions for bias reduction in rankings.

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.

TL;DR: This paper examines the limitations of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) in industrial applications, identifying spectral shift as a key issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate why TSFMs often fail to generalize effectively to industrial tasks, despite their success in public benchmarks.

Method: The authors conduct an industrial-scale experiment on player engagement prediction in mobile gaming and use controlled synthetic experiments to analyze the behavior of TSFMs under spectral mismatch.

Result: TSFMs perform poorly compared to domain-adapted baselines in industrial applications. Synthetic experiments reveal systematic performance degradation due to spectral mismatch.

Conclusion: Frequency awareness is crucial for deploying TSFMs effectively in industrial contexts, requiring new pretraining and evaluation methods that incorporate spectral diversity.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong results on public benchmarks, prompting comparisons to a "BERT moment" for time series. Their effectiveness in industrial settings, however, remains uncertain. We examine why TSFMs often struggle to generalize and highlight spectral shift (a mismatch between the dominant frequency components in downstream tasks and those represented during pretraining) as a key factor. We present evidence from an industrial-scale player engagement prediction task in mobile gaming, where TSFMs underperform domain-adapted baselines. To isolate the mechanism, we design controlled synthetic experiments contrasting signals with seen versus unseen frequency bands, observing systematic degradation under spectral mismatch. These findings position frequency awareness as critical for robust TSFM deployment and motivate new pretraining and evaluation protocols that explicitly account for spectral diversity.

*Longqing Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an analytical framework to simplify multi-layer ReLU networks into single-layer linear models with input-dependent effective weights. The evolution of these weights helps interpret class-specific learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the internal mechanisms and representation learning in deep neural networks is complex due to non-linear and high-dimensional properties. A simpler analytical framework is needed.

Method: Recasting multi-layer ReLU networks into equivalent single-layer linear models using input-specific "effective weights" based on activation patterns of ReLU units.

Result: The effective weights evolve during training—converging for samples within the same class and diverging for samples from different classes, revealing insights into semantic representation formation.

Conclusion: By tracking effective weight trajectories, this framework offers a novel interpretation of class-specific decision boundaries and representation learning in ReLU networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly those employing Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), are often perceived as complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. This complexity poses a significant challenge to understanding their internal learning mechanisms. In this work, we propose a novel analytical framework that recasts a multi-layer ReLU network into an equivalent single-layer linear model with input-dependent "effective weights". For any given input sample, the activation pattern of ReLU units creates a unique computational path, effectively zeroing out a subset of weights in the network. By composing the active weights across all layers, we can derive an effective weight matrix, $W_{\text{eff}}(x)$, that maps the input directly to the output for that specific sample. We posit that the evolution of these effective weights reveals fundamental principles of representation learning. Our work demonstrates that as training progresses, the effective weights corresponding to samples from the same class converge, while those from different classes diverge. By tracking the trajectories of these sample-wise effective weights, we provide a new lens through which to interpret the formation of class-specific decision boundaries and the emergence of semantic representations within the network.

*Mohammadreza M. Kalan,Yuyang Deng,Eitan J. Neugut,Samory Kpotufe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses transfer learning in Neyman-Pearson classification under distributional shifts in both $μ_0$ and $μ_1$, proposing an adaptive method with statistical and computational guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer learning in imbalanced Neyman-Pearson classification has received little attention, particularly when shifts occur in both type-I and type-II error distributions ($μ_0$ and $μ_1$).

Method: An adaptive procedure is proposed to handle shifts in both distributions while ensuring improved error control when the source is informative and avoiding negative transfer when it is not.

Result: The proposed method achieves improved error rates under informative conditions and computational efficiency, supported by theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: The work extends existing studies by addressing distribution shifts in both $μ_0$ and $μ_1$, providing an adaptive and efficient solution to Neyman-Pearson classification transfer learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in Neyman-Pearson classification, where the objective is to minimize the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_1$, subject to the constraint that the error w.r.t. a distribution $μ_0$ remains below a prescribed threshold. While transfer learning has been extensively studied in traditional classification, transfer learning in imbalanced classification such as Neyman-Pearson classification has received much less attention. This setting poses unique challenges, as both types of errors must be simultaneously controlled. Existing works address only the case of distribution shift in $μ_1$, whereas in many practical scenarios shifts may occur in both $μ_0$ and $μ_1$. We derive an adaptive procedure that not only guarantees improved Type-I and Type-II errors when the source is informative, but also automatically adapt to situations where the source is uninformative, thereby avoiding negative transfer. In addition to such statistical guarantees, the procedures is efficient, as shown via complementary computational guarantees.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural ODE framework for improving Sea Surface Temperature (SST) prediction through the incorporation of physical oceanographic principles and external forcing factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and accurately predicting SST is crucial due to its impacts on upper-ocean processes and ocean-atmosphere interactions. Current data-driven models lack interpretability and fail to address key physical dynamics and external SST drivers.

Method: The proposed method, SSTODE, uses ODEs derived from fluid transport principles combined with an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI) based on heat budget equations. Variational optimization recovers a latent velocity field governing SST dynamics.

Result: SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in global and regional SST forecasting tasks. It provides visual insights into ocean phenomena including advection, thermal diffusion, and heating-cooling cycles.

Conclusion: SSTODE enhances SST prediction accuracy while offering interpretability and physical consistency, providing insights into underlying dynamics and external forcing impacts on SST.

Abstract: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding upper-ocean thermal dynamics and ocean-atmosphere interactions, which have profound economic and social impacts. While data-driven models show promise in SST prediction, their black-box nature often limits interpretability and overlooks key physical processes. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been gaining momentum but struggle with complex ocean-atmosphere dynamics due to 1) inadequate characterization of seawater movement (e.g., coastal upwelling) and 2) insufficient integration of external SST drivers (e.g., turbulent heat fluxes). To address these challenges, we propose SSTODE, a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) framework for SST prediction. First, we derive ODEs from fluid transport principles, incorporating both advection and diffusion to model ocean spatiotemporal dynamics. Through variational optimization, we recover a latent velocity field that explicitly governs the temporal dynamics of SST. Building upon ODE, we introduce an Energy Exchanges Integrator (EEI)-inspired by ocean heat budget equations-to account for external forcing factors. Thus, the variations in the components of these factors provide deeper insights into SST dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTODE achieves state-of-the-art performances in global and regional SST forecasting benchmarks. Furthermore, SSTODE visually reveals the impact of advection dynamics, thermal diffusion patterns, and diurnal heating-cooling cycles on SST evolution. These findings demonstrate the model's interpretability and physical consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional turbulence models that introduce epistemic uncertainty due to empirical simplifications.

Method: Proposing a hybrid framework combining the Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) with CNNs to modulate perturbation magnitudes for improved calibration.

Result: The hybrid CNN-EPM framework significantly enhances the calibration and reduces the uncertainty bounds compared to EPM alone.

Conclusion: The incorporation of CNNs into EPM provides tighter, more accurate uncertainty estimates while maintaining physical consistency in modeling turbulent flows.

Abstract: Predicting the evolution of turbulent flows is central across science and engineering. Most studies rely on simulations with turbulence models, whose empirical simplifications introduce epistemic uncertainty. The Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) is a widely used physics-based approach to quantify model-form uncertainty, but being purely physics-based it can overpredict uncertainty bounds. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based modulation of EPM perturbation magnitudes to improve calibration while preserving physical consistency. Across canonical cases, the hybrid ML-EPM framework yields substantially tighter, better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than baseline EPM alone.

### [399] [Robust Causal Discovery under Imperfect Structural Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06790)
*Zidong Wang,Xi Lin,Chuchao He,Xiaoguang Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses causal discovery under flawed prior knowledge by proposing a model that aligns imperfect prior constraints with observational data, proving its robustness in various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal discovery methods do not perform well when prior knowledge is flawed, due to their reliance on rigid strategies that conflict with observational data.

Method: The authors propose a multi-task learning framework, involving prior alignment and conflict resolution, with a surrogate model assessing structural constraints and penalizing deviations between learned and prior matrices.

Result: The method demonstrates robustness across diverse noise conditions, structural equation models, and proves effective under imperfect constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully harmonizes flawed prior knowledge with data-driven objectives and reduces conflicts in causal discovery, proving efficient across linear and nonlinear settings.

Abstract: Robust causal discovery from observational data under imperfect prior knowledge remains a significant and largely unresolved challenge. Existing methods typically presuppose perfect priors or can only handle specific, pre-identified error types. And their performance degrades substantially when confronted with flawed constraints of unknown location and type. This decline arises because most of them rely on inflexible and biased thresholding strategies that may conflict with the data distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose to harmonizes knowledge and data through prior alignment and conflict resolution. First, we assess the credibility of imperfect structural constraints through a surrogate model, which then guides a sparse penalization term measuring the loss between the learned and constrained adjacency matrices. We theoretically prove that, under ideal assumption, the knowledge-driven objective aligns with the data-driven objective. Furthermore, to resolve conflicts when this assumption is violated, we introduce a multi-task learning framework optimized via multi-gradient descent, jointly minimizing both objectives. Our proposed method is robust to both linear and nonlinear settings. Extensive experiments, conducted under diverse noise conditions and structural equation model types, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under imperfect structural constraints.

### [400] [Beyond Uniform Deletion: A Data Value-Weighted Framework for Certified Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06794)
*Lisong He,Yi Yang,Xiangyu Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework (DVWU) for machine unlearning that considers the varying importance of data points, enhancing model performance after unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning algorithms treat all data equally, leading to potential performance degradation as they neglect heterogeneous data contributions.

Method: The authors propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), which incorporates a weighting strategy for data points based on their utility, adapts it to existing unlearning methods, and provides certified unlearning through output and objective perturbation.

Result: DVWU provides better predictive performance and robustness after unlearning across synthetic and real-world datasets, while demonstrating extensibility to gradient-based deep unlearning methods.

Conclusion: The DVWU framework successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods, offering a more effective approach by considering data value heterogeneity during the unlearning process.

Abstract: As the right to be forgotten becomes legislated worldwide, machine unlearning mechanisms have emerged to efficiently update models for data deletion and enhance user privacy protection. However, existing machine unlearning algorithms frequently neglect the fact that different data points may contribute unequally to model performance (i.e., heterogeneous data values). Treat them equally in machine unlearning procedure can potentially degrading the performance of updated models. To address this limitation, we propose Data Value-Weighted Unlearning (DVWU), a general unlearning framework that accounts for data value heterogeneity into the unlearning process. Specifically, we design a weighting strategy based on data values, which are then integrated into the unlearning procedure to enable differentiated unlearning for data points with varying utility to the model. The DVWU framework can be broadly adapted to various existing machine unlearning methods. We use the one-step Newton update as an example for implementation, developing both output and objective perturbation algorithms to achieve certified unlearning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods achieve superior predictive performance and robustness compared to conventional unlearning approaches. We further show the extensibility of our framework on gradient ascent method by incorporating the proposed weighting strategy into the gradient terms, highlighting the adaptability of DVWU for broader gradient-based deep unlearning methods.

### [401] [KLASS: KL-Guided Fast Inference in Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05664)
*Seo Hyun Kim,Sunwoo Hong,Hojung Jung,Youngrok Park,Se-Young Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling (KLASS), a faster sampling method for masked diffusion models, which improves efficiency and maintains high-quality outputs across tasks like text, image, and molecular generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked diffusion models are bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speeds during iterative inference, necessitating a more efficient approach to maintain performance and reduce sampling time.

Method: KLASS leverages token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions, enabling the unmasking of multiple tokens per iteration without additional model training. This speeds up the generation process while preserving quality.

Result: KLASS achieves significant speed-ups in wall-clock generation (up to 2.78×) and improves performance in reasoning benchmarks compared to greedy decoding, achieving state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers.

Conclusion: KLASS is a broadly applicable, fast, and effective sampling method for diffusion models, demonstrated across diverse generation tasks like text, images, and molecules.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have demonstrated competitive results on various tasks including language generation. However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers. We further validate KLASS across diverse domains, including text, image, and molecular generation, showing its effectiveness as a broadly applicable sampler across different models.

### [402] [Beyond Observations: Reconstruction Error-Guided Irregularly Sampled Time Series Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06854)
*Jiexi Liu,Meng Cao,Songcan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iTimER is a self-supervised framework for irregularly sampled time series, leveraging reconstruction error and mixup strategies to generate informative pseudo-observations and achieve superior task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for irregularly sampled time series miss the opportunity to utilize reconstruction errors as a signal for learning, which can offer insights into unobserved data.

Method: iTimER employs reconstruction error modeling, pseudo-observation generation using mixup strategies, Wasserstein metrics for error distribution alignment, and contrastive learning to improve representation learning.

Result: iTimER achieves consistent performance improvements in classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of reconstruction errors as a learning signal and validates its effectiveness across multiple ISTS tasks.

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.

*Anirudh Satheesh,Keenan Powell,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DR-SPCRL introduces a dynamic robustness budget for reinforcement learning, balancing performance and robustness in fluctuating environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning models struggle to adapt to distribution shifts present in real-world applications.

Method: The paper proposes DR-SPCRL, which employs a self-paced curriculum for dynamically adjusting the robustness budget ($ε$) during training.

Result: Empirical evaluations show approximately 11.8% improvement in episodic returns under perturbations and a 1.9x increase in performance compared to nominal RL algorithms.

Conclusion: DR-SPCRL resolves performance-robustness trade-offs, enhancing adaptability and stability in reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: A central challenge in reinforcement learning is that policies trained in controlled environments often fail under distribution shifts at deployment into real-world environments. Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning (DRRL) addresses this by optimizing for worst-case performance within an uncertainty set defined by a robustness budget $ε$. However, fixing $ε$ results in a tradeoff between performance and robustness: small values yield high nominal performance but weak robustness, while large values can result in instability and overly conservative policies. We propose Distributionally Robust Self-Paced Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (DR-SPCRL), a method that overcomes this limitation by treating $ε$ as a continuous curriculum. DR-SPCRL adaptively schedules the robustness budget according to the agent's progress, enabling a balance between nominal and robust performance. Empirical results across multiple environments demonstrate that DR-SPCRL not only stabilizes training but also achieves a superior robustness-performance trade-off, yielding an average 11.8\% increase in episodic return under varying perturbations compared to fixed or heuristic scheduling strategies, and achieving approximately 1.9$\times$ the performance of the corresponding nominal RL algorithms.

*Xinlong Zhao,Tong Jia,Minghua He,Xixuan Yang,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Log-based anomaly detection is improved with FusionLog, a zero-label method combining general and proprietary knowledge, achieving over 90% F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to address the mismatch between general anomaly patterns and target system-specific knowledge.

Method: FusionLog partitions logs into general and proprietary types, leveraging meta-learning for general logs and collaborative distillation for proprietary logs.

Result: FusionLog demonstrated significant performance improvements, achieving an F1-score above 90% on public datasets in zero-label scenarios.

Conclusion: FusionLog successfully integrates two knowledge types, providing effective cross-system anomaly detection without labeled target logs.

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of web systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of sufficient labeled logs, which limits the rapid deployment in new systems. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from a mature web system and a small amount of labeled logs from a new system, using transfer learning to extract and generalize general knowledge across both domains. However, these methods focus solely on the transfer of general knowledge and neglect the disparity and potential mismatch between such knowledge and the proprietary knowledge of target system, thus constraining performance. To address this limitation, we propose FusionLog, a novel zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection method that effectively achieves the fusion of general and proprietary knowledge, enabling cross-system generalization without any labeled target logs. Specifically, we first design a training-free router based on semantic similarity that dynamically partitions unlabeled target logs into 'general logs' and 'proprietary logs.' For general logs, FusionLog employs a small model based on system-agnostic representation meta-learning for direct training and inference, inheriting the general anomaly patterns shared between the source and target systems. For proprietary logs, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels and fine-tune the small model using multi-round collaborative knowledge distillation and fusion based on large language model (LLM) and small model (SM) to enhance its capability to recognize anomaly patterns specific to the target system. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that FusionLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art cross-system log-based anomaly detection methods.

*Viktor Veselý,Aleksandar Todorov,Matthia Sabatelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the double descent phenomenon in Deep Reinforcement Learning, highlighting its presence and connection with policy entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Double descent is a known paradox in over-parameterized models, where generalization improves beyond interpolation. Its exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning, which deals with non-stationary domains, remains limited.

Method: The authors conduct systematic investigations into double descent behavior using Actor-Critic frameworks with varying model capacities, employing information-theoretic metrics like Policy Entropy.

Result: Preliminary results show double descent curves during training, where reduced Policy Entropy correlates with improved generalization and robustness due to over-parameterization acting as implicit regularization.

Conclusion: Findings establish double descent as applicable in DRL, and propose policy entropy as a mechanism for designing robust and transferable agents.

Abstract: The double descent (DD) paradox, where over-parameterized models see generalization improve past the interpolation point, remains largely unexplored in the non-stationary domain of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We present preliminary evidence that DD exists in model-free DRL, investigating it systematically across varying model capacity using the Actor-Critic framework. We rely on an information-theoretic metric, Policy Entropy, to measure policy uncertainty throughout training. Preliminary results show a clear epoch-wise DD curve; the policy's entrance into the second descent region correlates with a sustained, significant reduction in Policy Entropy. This entropic decay suggests that over-parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, guiding the policy towards robust, flatter minima in the loss landscape. These findings establish DD as a factor in DRL and provide an information-based mechanism for designing agents that are more general, transferable, and robust.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low participation rates in cancer clinical trials highlight the need for efficient eligibility screening systems.

Method: MSK-MATCH combines a large language model, oncology trial knowledge base, and retrieval-augmented architecture to process and explain trial eligibility from clinical text.

Result: The system resolved 61.9% of cases automatically, triaged 38.1% for human review, and achieved over 98% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. It cut screening time for triaged cases to 43 seconds and reduced costs.

Conclusion: MSK-MATCH demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted workflows to enhance screening efficiency and reduce barriers in clinical trial participation.

Abstract: Clinical trials play an important role in cancer care and research, yet participation rates remain low. We developed MSK-MATCH (Memorial Sloan Kettering Multi-Agent Trial Coordination Hub), an AI system for automated eligibility screening from clinical text. MSK-MATCH integrates a large language model with a curated oncology trial knowledge base and retrieval-augmented architecture providing explanations for all AI predictions grounded in source text. In a retrospective dataset of 88,518 clinical documents from 731 patients across six breast cancer trials, MSK-MATCH automatically resolved 61.9% of cases and triaged 38.1% for human review. This AI-assisted workflow achieved 98.6% accuracy, 98.4% sensitivity, and 98.7% specificity for patient-level eligibility classification, matching or exceeding performance of the human-only and AI-only comparisons. For the triaged cases requiring manual review, prepopulating eligibility screens with AI-generated explanations reduced screening time from 20 minutes to 43 seconds at an average cost of $0.96 per patient-trial pair.

*Pasan Dissanayake,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabDistill leverages transformer-based models’ pre-trained knowledge and simplifies it into neural networks for efficient tabular data classification with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between high performance and increased complexity when using transformer-based models in few-shot regimes for tabular data.

Method: Introduce a distillation framework, TabDistill, to transfer the pre-trained knowledge of transformer-based models into simpler, parameter-efficient neural networks.

Result: Distilled neural networks outperform classical models like regular neural networks, XGBoost, and logistic regression, and sometimes even surpass the original transformer-based models.

Conclusion: TabDistill effectively combines parameter efficiency and strong performance under few-shot regimes, making it a robust solution for tabular data classification.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have shown promising performance on tabular data compared to their classical counterparts such as neural networks and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) in scenarios with limited training data. They utilize their pre-trained knowledge to adapt to new domains, achieving commendable performance with only a few training examples, also called the few-shot regime. However, the performance gain in the few-shot regime comes at the expense of significantly increased complexity and number of parameters. To circumvent this trade-off, we introduce TabDistill, a new strategy to distill the pre-trained knowledge in complex transformer-based models into simpler neural networks for effectively classifying tabular data. Our framework yields the best of both worlds: being parameter-efficient while performing well with limited training data. The distilled neural networks surpass classical baselines such as regular neural networks, XGBoost and logistic regression under equal training data, and in some cases, even the original transformer-based models that they were distilled from.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness-aware methods often struggle with high computational demands, scalability issues, and poor generalization in high-stakes applications.

Method: The proposed framework leverages Bayesian data selection and aligns posterior distributions using discrepancy measures such as Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's superior fairness and accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates biases in training data, enhances fairness in downstream tasks, and offers theoretical guarantees for its effectiveness.

Abstract: Fairness concerns are increasingly critical as machine learning models are deployed in high-stakes applications. While existing fairness-aware methods typically intervene at the model level, they often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian data selection framework that ensures fairness by aligning group-specific posterior distributions of model parameters and sample weights with a shared central distribution. Our framework supports flexible alignment via various distributional discrepancy measures, including Wasserstein distance, maximum mean discrepancy, and $f$-divergence, allowing geometry-aware control without imposing explicit fairness constraints. This data-centric approach mitigates group-specific biases in training data and improves fairness in downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing data selection and model-based fairness methods in both fairness and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal machine learning methods lack modality-aware insights and rely on heuristics, making them inadequate for high-stake environments with uncertainty.

Method: A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework combined with theoretical complexity analysis, generalization bounds, and encoder-specific error analysis.

Result: Validated improved robustness using both simulations and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: This framework offers substantial theoretical and empirical grounds for using multimodal machine learning in scenarios involving uncertainty and high stakes.

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributionally robust multimodal machine learning. Existing approaches often rely on merging modalities on the feature level (early fusion) or heuristic uncertainty modeling, which downplays modality-aware effects and provide limited insights. We propose a novel distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that aims to study both the theoretical and practical insights of multimodal machine learning. We first justify this setup and show the significance of this problem through complexity analysis. We then establish both generalization upper bounds and minimax lower bounds which provide performance guarantees. These results are further extended in settings where we consider encoder-specific error propogations. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach improves robustness in both simulation settings and real-world datasets. Together, these findings provide a principled foundation for employing multimodal machine learning models in high-stakes applications where uncertainty is unavoidable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GastroDL-Fusion integrates protein-ligand data with gene sequence information using deep learning to predict binding affinity, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug discovery for gastrointestinal diseases needs more accurate models incorporating genetic determinants and structural features.

Method: The framework uses Graph Isomorphism Network for molecular graph modeling and a pre-trained Transformer for gene sequences, followed by a multi-layer perceptron for fusion.

Result: GastroDL-Fusion achieves superior predictive performance with MAE of 1.12 and RMSE of 1.75 over existing methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural and genetic data provides reliable predictions for accelerating drug and vaccine development for GI diseases.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity plays a pivotal role in accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and vaccines, particularly for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases such as gastric ulcers, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Traditional computational models often rely on structural information alone and thus fail to capture the genetic determinants that influence disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. To address this gap, we propose GastroDL-Fusion, a dual-modal deep learning framework that integrates protein-ligand complex data with disease-associated gene sequence information for drug and vaccine development. In our approach, protein-ligand complexes are represented as molecular graphs and modeled using a Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), while gene sequences are encoded into biologically meaningful embeddings via a pre-trained Transformer (ProtBERT/ESM). These complementary modalities are fused through a multi-layer perceptron to enable robust cross-modal interaction learning. We evaluate the model on benchmark datasets of GI disease-related targets, demonstrating that GastroDL-Fusion significantly improves predictive performance over conventional methods. Specifically, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.12 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.75, outperforming CNN, BiLSTM, GIN, and Transformer-only baselines. These results confirm that incorporating both structural and genetic features yields more accurate predictions of binding affinities, providing a reliable computational tool for accelerating the design of targeted therapies and vaccines in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to evaluate the utility of traditional chemical functional groups in chemistry by using principles from computational learning theory to validate their explanatory and predictive power.

Method: The paper employs the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle along with an unsupervised learning algorithm to analyze three million molecules and generate dataset-specific functional group representations.

Result: Their method identifies both traditional and novel functional groups and constructs functional-group-based fingerprints that outperform existing chemical representations in bioactivity prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Functional groups, both traditional and dataset-specific, are valuable for chemical explanations and predictions, offering an improved approach for studying molecular bioactivity through computational methods.

Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges such as high noise, inter-subject variability, and imbalanced data in biosignal classification, the paper aims to develop a novel framework leveraging quantum-inspired principles for stable and uncertainty-aware learning.

Method: The QiVC framework integrates quantum-inspired rotated ensembles (QiRE) that perform low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogous to quantum state evolution. It also introduces the QiVC-Net for biosignal classification, ensuring computational efficiency.

Result: Experiments on benchmark biosignal datasets show state-of-the-art accuracy for QiVC-Net, achieving 97.84% and 97.89% in classification tasks, demonstrating the framework's robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The QiVC framework provides a promising approach for uncertainty-aware and computationally efficient modeling, with the potential to enhance performance in biomedical signal analysis and other applications.

Abstract: This work introduces the quantum-inspired variational convolution (QiVC) framework, a novel learning paradigm that integrates principles of probabilistic inference, variational optimization, and quantum-inspired transformations within convolutional architectures. The central innovation of QiVC lies in its quantum-inspired rotated ensemble (QiRE) mechanism. QiRE performs differentiable low-dimensional subspace rotations of convolutional weights, analogously to quantum state evolution. This approach enables structured uncertainty modeling while preserving the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space, resulting in more expressive, stable, and uncertainty-aware representations. To demonstrate its practical potential, the concept is instantiated in a QiVC-based convolutional network (QiVC-Net) and evaluated in the context of biosignal classification, focusing on phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings, a challenging domain characterized by high noise, inter-subject variability, and often imbalanced data. The proposed QiVC-Net integrates an architecture in which the QiVC layer does not introduce additional parameters, instead performing an ensemble rotation of the convolutional weights through a structured mechanism ensuring robustness without added highly computational burden. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, PhysioNet CinC 2016 and PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope 2022, show that QiVC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching accuracies of 97.84% and 97.89%, respectively. These findings highlight the versatility of the QiVC framework and its promise for advancing uncertainty-aware modeling in real-world biomedical signal analysis. The implementation of the QiVConv layer is openly available in GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper explores how overparameterized ReLU networks behave like kernel models at infinite width and small learning rates. It analyzes the impact of depth on the limiting kernel and its closed-form solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical behavior of overparameterized neural networks, particularly ReLU architectures, under gradient descent, focusing on their convergence properties with increasing depth.

Method: Theoretical analysis is conducted on the normalized limiting kernel and the closed-form solution for ReLU networks. Empirical evaluations are also performed to observe convergence behavior with network depth.

Result: The normalized limiting kernel converges to the matrix of ones for deep networks, and the closed-form solutions approach a fixed limit on the sphere. The paper provides insights into depth requirements for convergence.

Conclusion: Increasing depth affects the behavior of ReLU networks' limiting kernel and closed-form solutions. The findings extend to the generalization of other kernels, highlighting depth-induced sensitivity in theoretical network modeling.

Abstract: Overparameterized fully-connected neural networks have been shown to behave like kernel models when trained with gradient descent, under mild conditions on the width, the learning rate, and the parameter initialization. In the limit of infinitely large widths and small learning rate, the kernel that is obtained allows to represent the output of the learned model with a closed-form solution. This closed-form solution hinges on the invertibility of the limiting kernel, a property that often holds on real-world datasets. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of large ReLU networks to increasing depths by characterizing the corresponding limiting kernel. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the normalized limiting kernel approaches the matrix of ones. In contrast, they show the corresponding closed-form solution approaches a fixed limit on the sphere. We empirically evaluate the order of magnitude in network depth required to observe this convergent behavior, and we describe the essential properties that enable the generalization of our results to other kernels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of estimating means efficiently in scenarios with limited labeled data by leveraging auxiliary information.

Method: The proposed method, PartiBandits, uses a two-stage algorithm combining partition learning and a UCB-style labeling subroutine to minimize variance and optimize label efficiency.

Result: PartiBandits yields a convergence rate for the mean estimation error that is minimax optimal in classical active learning settings.

Conclusion: PartiBandits effectively bridges two active learning approaches, UCB and disagreement-based methods, providing robust means estimation, validated on electronic health records simulations.

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently estimating the mean of a $k$-class random variable, $Y$, using a limited number of labels, $N$, in settings where the analyst has access to auxiliary information (i.e.: covariates) $X$ that may be informative about $Y$. We propose an active learning algorithm ("PartiBandits") to estimate $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\widehatμ_{\text{PB}}$, such that $\left( \widehatμ_{\text{PB}} - \mathbb{E}[Y]\right)^2$ is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{ν+ \exp(c \cdot (-N/\log(N))) }{N} \right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $ν$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine ("WarmStart-UCB") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks. We illustrate our methods through simulation using nationwide electronic health records. Our methods can be implemented using the PartiBandits package in R.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using private dataset sketches for differential privacy in linear regression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy concerns in linear regression applications involving sensitive data.

Method: The paper proposes creating differentially private sketches for datasets, enabling the use of existing regression solvers without compromising privacy.

Result: Introduced private sketches for least squares and least absolute deviations regression while maintaining differential privacy.

Conclusion: The private dataset sketches provide practical privacy-preserving methods for linear regression analysis without altering standard solvers.

Abstract: Linear regression is frequently applied in a variety of domains. In order to improve the efficiency of these methods, various methods have been developed that compute summaries or \emph{sketches} of the datasets. Certain domains, however, contain sensitive data which necessitates that the application of these statistical methods does not reveal private information. Differentially private (DP) linear regression methods have been developed for mitigating this problem. These techniques typically involve estimating a noisy version of the parameter vector. Instead, we propose releasing private sketches of the datasets. We present differentially private sketches for the problems of least squares regression, as well as least absolute deviations regression. The availability of these private sketches facilitates the application of commonly available solvers for regression, without the risk of privacy leakage.

### [416] [Beyond Redundancy: Diverse and Specialized Multi-Expert Sparse Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05745)
*Zhen Xu,Zhen Tan,Song Wang,Kaidi Xu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper enhances Sparse Autoencoders for interpreting large language models by addressing inefficiencies in Mixture of Experts approaches, achieving better specialization and reduced redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability and computational feasibility of Sparse Autoencoders in analyzing large language models.

Method: The authors introduce Multiple Expert Activation and Feature Scaling to address the lack of specialization and redundancy in Mixture of Experts-based Sparse Autoencoders.

Result: Experiments show a 24% reduction in reconstruction error and a 99% decrease in feature redundancy compared to current methods.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations bridge the gap between interpretability and efficiency in LLM analysis while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting large language models (LLMs) by decomposing token activations into combinations of human-understandable features. While SAEs provide crucial insights into LLM explanations, their practical adoption faces a fundamental challenge: better interpretability demands that SAEs' hidden layers have high dimensionality to satisfy sparsity constraints, resulting in prohibitive training and inference costs. Recent Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches attempt to address this by partitioning SAEs into narrower expert networks with gated activation, thereby reducing computation. In a well-designed MoE, each expert should focus on learning a distinct set of features. However, we identify a \textit{critical limitation} in MoE-SAE: Experts often fail to specialize, which means they frequently learn overlapping or identical features. To deal with it, we propose two key innovations: (1) Multiple Expert Activation that simultaneously engages semantically weighted expert subsets to encourage specialization, and (2) Feature Scaling that enhances diversity through adaptive high-frequency scaling. Experiments demonstrate a 24\% lower reconstruction error and a 99\% reduction in feature redundancy compared to existing MoE-SAE methods. This work bridges the interpretability-efficiency gap in LLM analysis, allowing transparent model inspection without compromising computational feasibility.

*Yu Huang,Zixin Wen,Aarti Singh,Yuejie Chi,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines how transformers perform reasoning on synthetic state-tracking tasks and explores their ability to generalize longer chains of reasoning through theoretical and experimental analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether transformers can generalize reasoning patterns learned in shorter tasks to tackle longer chain-of-thought (CoT) tasks, contributing to a deeper understanding of AI reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors conduct a mathematical analysis of transformers trained on state-tracking tasks, proving the connection between attention concentration and task structure for long-context reasoning. They also implement a recursive self-training scheme to improve reasoning length.

Result: The study theoretically proves that constant-depth transformers can solve $\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, provides optimization guarantees, and experimentally corroborates attention concentration as a critical mechanism for length generalization.

Conclusion: Transformers, through proper learning mechanisms and attention mechanisms, can generalize reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks of longer reasoning lengths, thus extending their capabilities in AI reasoning.

Abstract: The ability to reason lies at the core of artificial intelligence (AI), and challenging problems usually call for deeper and longer reasoning to tackle. A crucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned reasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on synthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove how the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of extrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the length generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention concentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the state-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for transformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive self-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem lengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that constant-depth transformers provably learn $\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems with CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\mathsf{TC}^0$, unless the widely held conjecture $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$ fails. Finally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical results, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of attention concentration.

*Anirudh Satheesh,Sooraj Sathish,Swetha Ganesh,Keenan Powell,Vaneet Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in Robust Constrained Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes (RCMDPs) by proposing an actor-critic algorithm that achieves ε-feasibility and ε-optimality with established sample complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding robust and safe policies in RCMDPs is difficult due to the lack of strong duality in constrained reinforcement learning and the non-contractive nature of the Robust Bellman operator in average-cost settings.

Method: The authors propose an actor-critic algorithm tailored to Average-Cost RCMDPs to overcome the challenges presented by lack of strong duality and the average-cost framework.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves ε-feasibility and ε-optimality, with sample complexities established at O(ε^-4) and O(ε^-6) depending on the slackness assumption.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective solution for robust constrained RL in average-cost settings, yielding comparable sample complexities to the discounted scenario.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of finding robust and safe policies in Robust Constrained Average-Cost Markov Decision Processes (RCMDPs). A key challenge in this setting is the lack of strong duality, which prevents the direct use of standard primal-dual methods for constrained RL. Additional difficulties arise from the average-cost setting, where the Robust Bellman operator is not a contraction under any norm. To address these challenges, we propose an actor-critic algorithm for Average-Cost RCMDPs. We show that our method achieves both \(ε\)-feasibility and \(ε\)-optimality, and we establish a sample complexities of \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-4}\right)\) and \(\tilde{O}\left(ε^{-6}\right)\) with and without slackness assumption, which is comparable to the discounted setting.

*Zishuai Liu,Weihang You,Jin Lu,Fei Dou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MARAuder's Map, a framework for real-time human activity recognition using raw sensor data in smart homes. It enhances spatial, temporal modeling and context awareness to improve robustness in real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address challenges in human activity recognition using ambient sensors, including real-time inference, spatial reasoning based on environment layout, and temporal context modeling, which are often overlooked by existing methods.

Method: The authors propose projecting sensor activations onto the physical floorplan as spatial trajectories, processed by a hybrid deep learning model with features like a learnable time embedding module and attention-based encoder for enhanced temporal and spatial recognition.

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets show that the framework outperforms existing baseline methods in accurately recognizing human activity under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: MARAuder's Map presents an effective approach for improving the performance of real-time human activity recognition in smart homes, showcasing strong adaptability to continuous and ambiguous real-world environments.

Abstract: Ambient sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) in smart homes remains challenging due to the need for real-time inference, spatially grounded reasoning, and context-aware temporal modeling. Existing approaches often rely on pre-segmented, within-activity data and overlook the physical layout of the environment, limiting their robustness in continuous, real-world deployments. In this paper, we propose MARAuder's Map, a novel framework for real-time activity recognition from raw, unsegmented sensor streams. Our method projects sensor activations onto the physical floorplan to generate trajectory-aware, image-like sequences that capture the spatial flow of human movement. These representations are processed by a hybrid deep learning model that jointly captures spatial structure and temporal dependencies. To enhance temporal awareness, we introduce a learnable time embedding module that encodes contextual cues such as hour-of-day and day-of-week. Additionally, an attention-based encoder selectively focuses on informative segments within each observation window, enabling accurate recognition even under cross-activity transitions and temporal ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world smart home datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines, offering a practical solution for real-time HAR in ambient sensor environments.

*Xiao-Cheng Liao,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SymLight, a new method, uses symbolic priority functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search to create interpretable, deployable traffic signal control policies, showing strong performance in real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of neural policies in Traffic Signal Control (TSC), like over-parameterization, lack of transparency, and deployment challenges on edge devices.

Method: SymLight utilizes symbolic priority functions guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It represents traffic features concisely to reduce action space complexity and employs a probabilistic structural rollout strategy to leverage high-quality patterns.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets verify superior performance of SymLight compared to baseline methods. Key strength lies in its interpretability and deployability without sacrificing control quality.

Conclusion: SymLight successfully generates effective and interpretable TSC policies using symbolic priority functions and maintains high performance for practical deployment.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning have achieved significant success in automatically devising effective traffic signal control (TSC) policies. Neural policies, however, tend to be over-parameterized and non-transparent, hindering their interpretability and deployability on resource-limited edge devices. This work presents SymLight, a priority function search framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for discovering inherently interpretable and deployable symbolic priority functions to serve as the TSC policies. The priority function, in particular, accepts traffic features as input and then outputs a priority for each traffic signal phase, which subsequently directs the phase transition. For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive priority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial explosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural rollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously discovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance across a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce interpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent performance.

### [421] [Beyond the Lower Bound: Bridging Regret Minimization and Best Arm Identification in Lexicographic Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05802)
*Bo Xue,Yuanyu Wan,Zhichao Lu,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing multiple objectives in prioritized order using lexicographic bandits, bridging regret minimization and best arm identification with novel algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences by optimizing each objective in a prioritized order and advancing methods in lexicographic bandits.

Method: Two elimination-based algorithms are proposed: one sequentially eliminates suboptimal arms by priority layers; the other algorithm exploits cross-objective dependencies for better performance.

Result: The second algorithm surpasses single-objective bandit performance lower bounds, while both algorithms show superior empirical results against baselines.

Conclusion: Cross-objective information sharing significantly enhances performance in multi-objective settings, and the proposed algorithms efficiently bridge regret minimization and best arm identification.

Abstract: In multi-objective decision-making with hierarchical preferences, lexicographic bandits provide a natural framework for optimizing multiple objectives in a prioritized order. In this setting, a learner repeatedly selects arms and observes reward vectors, aiming to maximize the reward for the highest-priority objective, then the next, and so on. While previous studies have primarily focused on regret minimization, this work bridges the gap between \textit{regret minimization} and \textit{best arm identification} under lexicographic preferences. We propose two elimination-based algorithms to address this joint objective. The first algorithm eliminates suboptimal arms sequentially, layer by layer, in accordance with the objective priorities, and achieves sample complexity and regret bounds comparable to those of the best single-objective algorithms. The second algorithm simultaneously leverages reward information from all objectives in each round, effectively exploiting cross-objective dependencies. Remarkably, it outperforms the known lower bound for the single-objective bandit problem, highlighting the benefit of cross-objective information sharing in the multi-objective setting. Empirical results further validate their superior performance over baselines.

### [422] [Measuring Model Performance in the Presence of an Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05805)
*Winston Chen,Michael W. Sjoding,Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study addresses biases in AI model evaluation caused by interventions in RCT settings and introduces a method (NPW) for efficient and unbiased model assessment using all available data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI model evaluation can be biased by interventions affecting outcomes in applications for social impact. The inefficiencies of existing RCT evaluation methods limit the data utilization, needing innovative strategies for unbiased evaluation.

Method: The authors propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), a reweighting methodology that uses data from both treatment and control groups to mimic outcome distributions without intervention.

Result: Synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that NPW enhances model evaluation and selection compared to traditional approaches that ignore treatment group data, under various scenarios.

Conclusion: Utilizing NPW for RCT data leads to improved and more efficient AI model evaluations, representing progress towards practical applications in intervention-related settings.

Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from naïvely aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups, and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

*Yu Zhang,Hui-Ling Zhen,Mingxuan Yuan,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOSS, a framework to improve the efficiency and numerical stability of FP8-based training for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FP8 training methods face challenges with numerical precision, dequantization overhead, and inefficiencies due to dynamic scaling techniques.

Method: MOSS employs a two-level microscaling strategy for activations and automatic scaling for weights to improve FP8 training performance.

Result: MOSS enables efficient training of a 7B parameter model with 34% higher throughput and comparable performance to BF16 baselines.

Conclusion: By addressing the inefficiencies and stability issues in FP8 training, MOSS offers a robust and efficient solution for large-scale model training.

Abstract: Training large language models with FP8 formats offers significant efficiency gains. However, the reduced numerical precision of FP8 poses challenges for stable and accurate training. Current frameworks preserve training performance using mixed-granularity quantization, i.e., applying per-group quantization for activations and per-tensor/block quantization for weights. While effective, per-group quantization requires scaling along the inner dimension of matrix multiplication, introducing additional dequantization overhead. Moreover, these frameworks often rely on just-in-time scaling to dynamically adjust scaling factors based on the current data distribution. However, this online quantization is inefficient for FP8 training, as it involves multiple memory reads and writes that negate the performance benefits of FP8. To overcome these limitations, we propose MOSS, a novel FP8 training framework that ensures both efficiency and numerical stability. MOSS introduces two key innovations: (1) a two-level microscaling strategy for quantizing sensitive activations, which balances precision and dequantization cost by combining a high-precision global scale with compact, power-of-two local scales; and (2) automatic scaling for weights in linear layers, which eliminates the need for costly max-reduction operations by predicting and adjusting scaling factors during training. Leveraging these techniques, MOSS enables efficient FP8 training of a 7B parameter model, achieving performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while achieving up to 34% higher training throughput.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses optimizing Mixture of Experts models for environments with limited GPU memory through MoE offloading techniques, focusing on better caching algorithms and expert pre-fetching strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Mixture of Experts (MoE) models in memory-constrained environments is challenging due to their high memory demands.

Method: The study examines caching behaviors (LRU, LFU), proposes LFU optimizations, analyzes expert activation, and implements speculative expert pre-fetching techniques.

Result: LFU caching optimization significantly outperforms LRU, and speculative expert pre-fetching demonstrates strong potential in improving MoE deployment.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into MoE architecture behavior, caching optimizations, and pre-fetching techniques, while also suggesting potential advancements in pruning methods with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: In today's landscape, Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a crucial architecture that has been used by many of the most advanced models. One of the major challenges of MoE models is that they usually require much more memory than their dense counterparts due to their unique architecture, and hence are harder to deploy in environments with limited GPU memory, such as edge devices. MoE offloading is a promising technique proposed to overcome this challenge, especially if it is enhanced with caching and pre-fetching, but prior work stopped at suboptimal caching algorithm and offered limited insights. In this work, we study MoE offloading in depth and make the following contributions: 1. We analyze the expert activation and LRU caching behavior in detail and provide traces. 2. We propose LFU caching optimization based on our analysis and obtain strong improvements from LRU. 3. We implement and experiment speculative expert pre-fetching, providing detailed trace showing its huge potential . 4. In addition, our study extensively covers the behavior of the MoE architecture itself, offering information on the characteristic of the gating network and experts. This can inspire future work on the interpretation of MoE models and the development of pruning techniques for MoE architecture with minimal performance loss.

### [425] [Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05859)
*Dazhao Du,Tao Han,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PFRP method to enhance univariate time series forecasting by integrating global historical data, improving accuracy by 8.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Univariate forecasting models rely heavily on sliding windows limiting their access to global historical patterns during inference.

Method: The paper proposes a framework called Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP) using a Global Memory Bank and retrieval mechanisms for integrating global data.

Result: PFRP improved forecasting performance by 8.4% across seven real-world datasets.

Conclusion: By combining global and local predictions, PFRP enhances both accuracy and interpretability in univariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Deep learning models such as MLP, Transformer, and TCN have achieved remarkable success in univariate time series forecasting, typically relying on sliding window samples from historical data for training. However, while these models implicitly compress historical information into their parameters during training, they are unable to explicitly and dynamically access this global knowledge during inference, relying only on the local context within the lookback window. This results in an underutilization of rich patterns from the global history. To bridge this gap, we propose Predicting the Future by Retrieving the Past (PFRP), a novel approach that explicitly integrates global historical data to enhance forecasting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a Global Memory Bank (GMB) to effectively store and manage global historical patterns. A retrieval mechanism is then employed to extract similar patterns from the GMB, enabling the generation of global predictions. By adaptively combining these global predictions with the outputs of any local prediction model, PFRP produces more accurate and interpretable forecasts. Extensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that PFRP significantly enhances the average performance of advanced univariate forecasting models by 8.4\%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMOD, a unified framework for emotion recognition using EEG signals that addresses poor generalization across datasets via a valence-arousal-based contrastive learning method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming limitations in generalization and semantic/structural alignment for EEG emotion recognition across datasets, which differ in annotation schemes and data formats.

Method: The paper proposes a Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning framework, using a Triple-Domain Encoder and Spatial-Temporal Transformer to project data into V-A space and align emotions through supervised contrastive loss.

Result: Experiments reveal improved generalization across datasets and state-of-the-art performance, as validated on eight public EEG datasets and three benchmarks.

Conclusion: EMOD presents a robust approach for EEG-based emotion recognition that unifies and streamlines datasets, enhancing adaptability and scalability in affective computing applications.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on eight public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges of time and data-intensive training typically seen in solving Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems like the TSP using traditional algorithms and ML-based models.

Method: The authors adapted and fine-tuned the TabPFN model to solve the TSP by using a node-based approach and node-predicting strategy to construct the TSP route with minimal training data.

Result: TabPFN successfully solves TSP instances of varying sizes with minimal training, completing training within minutes. It achieves efficient generalization, reduced performance degradation, and solution quality comparable to models requiring post-processing.

Conclusion: TabPFN is shown to be an effective and resource-efficient method for solving structured and CO problems, particularly in scenarios with constraints on training resources and rapid deployment needs.

Abstract: Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN) is a foundation model designed for small to medium-sized tabular data, which has attracted much attention recently. This paper investigates the application of TabPFN in Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems. The aim is to lessen challenges in time and data-intensive training requirements often observed in using traditional methods including exact and heuristic algorithms, Machine Learning (ML)-based models, to solve CO problems. Proposing possibly the first ever application of TabPFN for such a purpose, we adapt and fine-tune the TabPFN model to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known CO problems. Specifically, we adopt the node-based approach and the node-predicting adaptation strategy to construct the entire TSP route. Our evaluation with varying instance sizes confirms that TabPFN requires minimal training, adapts to TSP using a single sample, performs better generalization across varying TSP instance sizes, and reduces performance degradation. Furthermore, the training process with adaptation and fine-tuning is completed within minutes. The methodology leads to strong solution quality even without post-processing and achieves performance comparable to other models with post-processing refinement. Our findings suggest that the TabPFN model is a promising approach to solve structured and CO problems efficiently under training resource constraints and rapid deployment requirements.

TL;DR: The study introduces physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for predicting hydrogen crossover during PEM electrolysis, achieving high accuracy and efficiency for real-time control applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hydrogen crossover during PEM electrolysis poses safety risks and efficiency losses, which challenges current modeling approaches that are either resource-intensive or fail to generalize.

Method: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) was developed, incorporating physical laws like mass conservation and diffusion within a compact architecture. Validation was conducted across various conditions and compared to other methods.

Result: The PINN demonstrated exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%) and robustness, surpassing pure neural networks in extrapolation tasks. It enables real-time monitoring on diverse hardware, including edge devices.

Conclusion: This PINN approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for dynamic electrolyzer monitoring, aiding in the deployment of safe, large-scale green hydrogen production systems.

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85°C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE = 0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

*Vasily Ilin,Peter Sushko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an attention-based transformer framework to jointly estimate probability density and score functions from i.i.d. samples, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional score-matching methods that require separate models for each distribution and lack generalizability across different densities and sample sizes.

Method: A permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer is developed that uses cross-attention to connect samples to query points. The architecture ensures symmetry constraints and generalization, making the model compatible with different data distributions.

Result: The model outperforms kernel density estimation (KDE) and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE) in terms of error and scaling, with its attention weights analytically shown to recover classical KDE.

Conclusion: Transformers can serve as powerful, general-purpose tools for nonparametric density and score estimation, bridging classical methods like KDE with modern machine learning techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a unified attention-based framework for joint score and density estimation. Framing the problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, we develop a permutation- and affine-equivariant transformer that estimates both the probability density $f(x)$ and its score $\nabla_x \log f(x)$ directly from i.i.d. samples. Unlike traditional score-matching methods that require training a separate model for each distribution, our approach learns a single distribution-agnostic operator that generalizes across densities and sample sizes. The architecture employs cross-attention to connect observed samples with arbitrary query points, enabling generalization beyond the training data, while built-in symmetry constraints ensure equivariance to permutation and affine transformations. Analytically, we show that the attention weights can recover classical kernel density estimation (KDE), and verify it empirically, establishing a principled link between classical KDE and the transformer architecture. Empirically, the model achieves substantially lower error and better scaling than KDE and score-debiased KDE (SD-KDE), while exhibiting better runtime scaling. Together, these results establish transformers as general-purpose, data-adaptive operators for nonparametric density and score estimation.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates deep learning methods for predicting hospitalization and death in COPD patients, using large-scale longitudinal EHR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of predicting hospitalization and death in COPD patients, which is critical for healthcare management yet underexplored.

Method: It employs survival analysis using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches on longitudinal EHRs of over 150k patients.

Result: Deep learning models with recurrent architectures outperform other methods in predicting hospitalization and death.

Conclusion: Deep learning approaches are effective for risk stratification, demonstrating the ability to capture complex temporal patterns in EHR data for COPD patients.

Abstract: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of hospitalizations, strongly associated with decreased survival, yet predicting the timing of these events remains challenging and has received limited attention in the literature. In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to apply deep survival analysis on longitudinal EHR data to jointly predict multiple time-to-event outcomes in COPD patients, highlighting the potential of DL approaches to capture temporal patterns and improve risk stratification.

*Jayden Teoh,Manan Tomar,Kwangjun Ahn,Edward S. Hu,Pratyusha Sharma,Riashat Islam,Alex Lamb,John Langford*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NextLat introduces an auxiliary training method for transformers, encouraging the formation of compact belief states to improve generalization and sequence modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers often lack an inherent mechanism to compress historical information into robust latent states, negatively impacting their generalization capabilities.

Method: NextLat integrates self-supervised learning to predict the next latent state based on the next output token, adding a recurrent inductive bias without changing transformer architectures.

Result: Experiments reveal significant improvements in benchmarks for world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling, with better generalization and representation compression.

Conclusion: NextLat provides a simple yet effective approach to enhance transformer performance by encouraging compact internal world models, ensuring improved downstream tasks.

Abstract: Transformers replace recurrence with a memory that grows with sequence length and self-attention that enables ad-hoc look ups over past tokens. Consequently, they lack an inherent incentive to compress history into compact latent states with consistent transition rules. This often leads to learning solutions that generalize poorly. We introduce Next-Latent Prediction (NextLat), which extends standard next-token training with self-supervised predictions in the latent space. Specifically, NextLat trains a transformer to learn latent representations that are predictive of its next latent state given the next output token. Theoretically, we show that these latents provably converge to belief states, compressed information of the history necessary to predict the future. This simple auxiliary objective also injects a recurrent inductive bias into transformers, while leaving their architecture, parallel training, and inference unchanged. NextLat effectively encourages the transformer to form compact internal world models with its own belief states and transition dynamics -- a crucial property absent in standard next-token prediction transformers. Empirically, across benchmarks targeting core sequence modeling competencies -- world modeling, reasoning, planning, and language modeling -- NextLat demonstrates significant gains over standard next-token training in downstream accuracy, representation compression, and lookahead planning. NextLat stands as a simple and efficient paradigm for shaping transformer representations toward stronger generalization.

*Alice Ragonesi,Stefania Fresca,Karli Gillette,Stefan Kurath-Koller,Gernot Plank,Elena Zappon*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL) model for accurately predicting accessory pathway locations in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome using synthetic ECGs generated by personalized virtual heart models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate AP localization is vital for effective catheter ablation in WPW syndrome, yet current methods face limitations such as low localization resolution, poor interpretability, and reliance on small datasets.

Method: A DL model trained on synthetic ECG data derived from virtual heart models was developed. XAI techniques like Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM were employed to interpret model decisions.

Result: The DL model achieved over 95% localization accuracy, 94.32% sensitivity, and 99.78% specificity. Critical ECG leads for AP localization were identified, with V2 being the most crucial.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of integrating cardiac digital twins with explainable DL models for precise and transparent AP localization, addressing challenges in clinical adoption and improving non-invasive diagnostic methods.

Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac electrophysiology (EP) disorder caused by the presence of an accessory pathway (AP) that bypasses the atrioventricular node, faster ventricular activation rate, and provides a substrate for atrio-ventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). Accurate localization of the AP is critical for planning and guiding catheter ablation procedures. While traditional diagnostic tree (DT) methods and more recent machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed to predict AP location from surface electrocardiogram (ECG), they are often constrained by limited anatomical localization resolution, poor interpretability, and the use of small clinical datasets. In this study, we present a Deep Learning (DL) model for the localization of single manifest APs across 24 cardiac regions, trained on a large, physiologically realistic database of synthetic ECGs generated using a personalized virtual heart model. We also integrate eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM, into the pipeline. This enables interpretation of DL decision-making and addresses one of the main barriers to clinical adoption: lack of transparency in ML predictions. Our model achieves localization accuracy above 95%, with a sensitivity of 94.32% and specificity of 99.78%. XAI outputs are physiologically validated against known depolarization patterns, and a novel index is introduced to identify the most informative ECG leads for AP localization. Results highlight lead V2 as the most critical, followed by aVF, V1, and aVL. This work demonstrates the potential of combining cardiac digital twins with explainable DL to enable accurate, transparent, and non-invasive AP localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored area of using foundation models for time series imputation and evaluate their effectiveness for zero-shot imputation across real-world scenarios.

Method: Conducted univariate experiments across 33 datasets (around 1.3M imputation windows) to empirically study and evaluate the integration of covariates at inference time.

Result: Demonstrates the capability of time-indexed foundation models to perform robust zero-shot imputation in real-world time series data without retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Time-indexed foundation models show promise as practical tools for general-purpose, zero-shot missing value recovery in time series data under various conditions.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series imputation remain largely unexplored. Recently, two such models, TabPFN-TS and MoTM, have emerged. These models share a common philosophy that places them within the family of time-indexed foundation models. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of these models for zero-shot imputation, which enables missing value recovery without retraining across a wide range of scenarios. We conduct extensive univariate experiments across 33 out-of-domain datasets (approximately 1.3M imputation windows) and evaluate their ability to integrate covariates at inference time to improve accuracy without fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate that time-indexed foundation models are a powerful and practical step toward achieving general-purpose, zero-shot imputation for real-world time series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lethe, a dynamic framework to manage KV cache during generative reasoning by leveraging layer-wise sparsity and recency-aware retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce memory and latency overheads caused by long decoding sequences in generative reasoning with large language models, especially those central to reasoning tasks.

Method: Lethe dynamically manages the KV cache along spatial and temporal dimensions. It employs layer-wise sparsity-aware allocation for token pruning and a Recency-Aware Selective Retention (RASR) mechanism to decide token relevance during generation.

Result: Lethe significantly improves throughput by up to 2.56x while maintaining a balance between efficiency and generation quality across various models and tasks.

Conclusion: Lethe effectively optimizes long-form generation with reduced memory usage and higher efficiency, making it suitable for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

*Nikolaus Vertovec,Frederik Baymler Mathiesen,Thom Badings,Luca Laurenti,Alessandro Abate*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for verifying neural network-based control barrier functions (CBFs) by using piecewise linear bounds, enhancing scalability and efficiency in a way that surpasses existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of verifying neural network CBFs due to computational bottlenecks restricts the use of larger networks, prompting the need for an efficient verification framework.

Method: The authors propose a method using linear bound propagation (LBP) extended to compute bounds on neural network gradients combined with McCormick relaxation, creating linear bounds on CBF conditions. They also introduce a parallelizable region refinement strategy.

Result: The approach supports arbitrary control-affine systems and various nonlinear activation functions while scaling to larger neural networks, demonstrated by superior scalability in numerical experiments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method overcomes computational challenges in CBF verification, expanding practicality for larger networks in safety-critical control systems.

Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular tool for safety certification of nonlinear dynamical control systems. Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ITPP, a novel MTPP model that decouples event type information to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues in existing MTPP models, which mix different event types into a single representation, leading to performance degradation and overfitting.

Method: ITPP uses a channel-independent architecture with an encoder-decoder framework and an ODE-based backbone, along with a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism to model inter-channel correlations.

Result: ITPP consistently achieves better predictive accuracy and generalization compared to state-of-the-art MTPP models across real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: ITPP enhances effectiveness and robustness, solves the entanglement issue in MTPP models, and offers a promising solution for improved performance and reduced overfitting.

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPPs) provide a principled framework for modeling asynchronous event sequences by conditioning on the history of past events. However, most existing MTPP models rely on channel-mixing strategies that encode information from different event types into a single, fixed-size latent representation. This entanglement can obscure type-specific dynamics, leading to performance degradation and increased risk of overfitting. In this work, we introduce ITPP, a novel channel-independent architecture for MTPP modeling that decouples event type information using an encoder-decoder framework with an ODE-based backbone. Central to ITPP is a type-aware inverted self-attention mechanism, designed to explicitly model inter-channel correlations among heterogeneous event types. This architecture enhances effectiveness and robustness while reducing overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ITPP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MTPP models in both predictive accuracy and generalization.

Method: The proposed method, inspired by Neural Processes, assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations without compromising native data fidelity. It utilizes AI-driven super-resolution for reconstructing high-resolution mesoscale dynamics from coarse fields.

Result: ADAF-Ocean achieves efficient scalability with negligible parameter increase and extends forecast skill by up to 20 days when coupled with a DL forecasting system.

Conclusion: ADAF-Ocean offers a computationally efficient and scientifically robust solution for real-time and high-resolution modeling, improving ocean monitoring and forecasting capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient global ocean state estimation remains a grand challenge for Earth system science, hindered by the dual bottlenecks of computational scalability and degraded data fidelity in traditional data assimilation (DA) and deep learning (DL) approaches. Here we present an AI-driven Data Assimilation Framework for Ocean (ADAF-Ocean) that directly assimilates multi-source and multi-scale observations, ranging from sparse in-situ measurements to 4 km satellite swaths, without any interpolation or data thinning. Inspired by Neural Processes, ADAF-Ocean learns a continuous mapping from heterogeneous inputs to ocean states, preserving native data fidelity. Through AI-driven super-resolution, it reconstructs 0.25$^\circ$ mesoscale dynamics from coarse 1$^\circ$ fields, which ensures both efficiency and scalability, with just 3.7\% more parameters than the 1$^\circ$ configuration. When coupled with a DL forecasting system, ADAF-Ocean extends global forecast skill by up to 20 days compared to baselines without assimilation. This framework establishes a computationally viable and scientifically rigorous pathway toward real-time, high-resolution Earth system monitoring.

Motivation: To address limitations in previous one-step OFM approaches by designing a model that avoids inner optimization subproblems and enhances OT flow modeling.

Method: Proposes PICNN for constructing flow fields, couples Hamilton-Jacobi residual with flow matching loss during training, and enables Brenier-map or multi-step ODE sampling during prediction.

Result: The model demonstrates scalability and improved performance on standard optimal-transport benchmarks.

Conclusion: The consistency model effectively combines physics-informed design with optimal-transport flow principles, offering a versatile and improved solution for flow field modeling and prediction.

Abstract: We propose a consistency model based on the optimal-transport flow. A physics-informed design of partially input-convex neural networks (PICNN) plays a central role in constructing the flow field that emulates the displacement interpolation. During the training stage, we couple the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) residual in the OT formulation with the original flow matching loss function. Our approach avoids inner optimization subproblems that are present in previous one-step OFM approaches. During the prediction stage, our approach supports both one-step (Brenier-map) and multi-step ODE sampling from the same learned potential, leveraging the straightness of the OT flow. We validate scalability and performance on standard OT benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism aiming to maintain expressivity while having linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms like in Transformer models are powerful but often restricted by high complexity. The paper seeks to overcome the quadratic complexity while retaining expressivity.

Method: The authors propose Random Batch Attention (RBA), leveraging Random Batch Methods from computational mathematics. This mechanism is implemented with linear time complexity and parallelizable for efficient memory use.

Result: RBA demonstrates improvements over existing models and attention mechanisms, maintains theoretical support for expressivity, and shows convergence through both experiments and theoretical analysis.

Conclusion: Random Batch Attention provides a scalable and expressive alternative to traditional attention mechanisms, with theoretical grounding and practical advantages like reduced memory usage and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Attention mechanism is a significant part of Transformer models. It helps extract features from embedded vectors by adding global information and its expressivity has been proved to be powerful. Nevertheless, the quadratic complexity restricts its practicability. Although several researches have provided attention mechanism in sparse form, they are lack of theoretical analysis about the expressivity of their mechanism while reducing complexity. In this paper, we put forward Random Batch Attention (RBA), a linear self-attention mechanism, which has theoretical support of the ability to maintain its expressivity. Random Batch Attention has several significant strengths as follows: (1) Random Batch Attention has linear time complexity. Other than this, it can be implemented in parallel on a new dimension, which contributes to much memory saving. (2) Random Batch Attention mechanism can improve most of the existing models by replacing their attention mechanisms, even many previously improved attention mechanisms. (3) Random Batch Attention mechanism has theoretical explanation in convergence, as it comes from Random Batch Methods on computation mathematics. Experiments on large graphs have proved advantages mentioned above. Also, the theoretical modeling of self-attention mechanism is a new tool for future research on attention-mechanism analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel backdoor attack targeting tabular data by converting categorical features into floating-point representations and demonstrates its high success rate against state-of-the-art defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks in machine learning have been extensively studied, but prior work mainly focuses on homogeneous data like images, leaving tabular data largely unexplored despite its complexity and vulnerability.

Method: The authors propose a technique to encode categorical data as floating-point numbers to enable gradient-based universal perturbation attacks on tabular datasets. They evaluate this method across multiple datasets, models, and settings.

Result: The method achieves up to 100% attack success rates in both white-box and black-box scenarios, surpasses previous methods like Tabdoor in performance, and successfully evades advanced defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: Tabular data models are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and the proposed method illustrates a viable and stealthy means to exploit these weaknesses, highlighting the need for improved defenses.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks in machine learning have drawn significant attention for their potential to compromise models stealthily, yet most research has focused on homogeneous data such as images. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on tabular data, which is particularly challenging due to the presence of both numerical and categorical features. Our key idea is a novel technique to convert categorical values into floating-point representations. This approach preserves enough information to maintain clean-model accuracy compared to traditional methods like one-hot or ordinal encoding. By doing this, we create a gradient-based universal perturbation that applies to all features, including categorical ones.
  We evaluate our method on five datasets and four popular models. Our results show up to a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box settings (including real-world applications like Vertex AI), revealing a severe vulnerability for tabular data. Our method is shown to surpass the previous works like Tabdoor in terms of performance, while remaining stealthy against state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. We evaluate our attack against Spectral Signatures, Neural Cleanse, Beatrix, and Fine-Pruning, all of which fail to defend successfully against it. We also verify that our attack successfully bypasses popular outlier detection mechanisms.

Motivation: The need to exploit extremely long user histories for better short-video recommendations while maintaining efficiency in terms of latency and resource usage.

Method: The proposed methods include Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA) to reduce computational complexity, Request Level Batching (RLB) to optimize user encoding processes, and a length-extrapolative training strategy that allows inference on longer sequences without additional training.

Result: Offline and online experiments show monotonic performance gains as history length and model capacity increase, mirroring scaling behaviors observed in large language models. The system improves engagement metrics on Douyin while meeting production latency.

Conclusion: The new system demonstrates a practical ability to scale end-to-end long-sequence recommendation systems efficiently to handle 10k-length user histories without compromising performance or latency, enabling better user engagement at production scale.

Abstract: Short-video recommenders such as Douyin must exploit extremely long user histories without breaking latency or cost budgets. We present an end-to-end system that scales long-sequence modeling to 10k-length histories in production. First, we introduce Stacked Target-to-History Cross Attention (STCA), which replaces history self-attention with stacked cross-attention from the target to the history, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length and enabling efficient end-to-end training. Second, we propose Request Level Batching (RLB), a user-centric batching scheme that aggregates multiple targets for the same user/request to share the user-side encoding, substantially lowering sequence-related storage, communication, and compute without changing the learning objective. Third, we design a length-extrapolative training strategy -- train on shorter windows, infer on much longer ones -- so the model generalizes to 10k histories without additional training cost. Across offline and online experiments, we observe predictable, monotonic gains as we scale history length and model capacity, mirroring the scaling law behavior observed in large language models. Deployed at full traffic on Douyin, our system delivers significant improvements on key engagement metrics while meeting production latency, demonstrating a practical path to scaling end-to-end long-sequence recommendation to the 10k regime.

Result: NeuroPOL achieves accuracy in uncertainty propagation and failure probability estimation across various benchmarks while reducing communication overhead and power consumption.

Conclusion: NeuroPOL supports scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment, making it a promising framework for real-time reliability assessments and applications in edge devices and digital twins.

Abstract: Reliability analysis of engineering systems under uncertainty poses significant computational challenges, particularly for problems involving high-dimensional stochastic inputs, nonlinear system responses, and multiphysics couplings. Traditional surrogate modeling approaches often incur high energy consumption, which severely limits their scalability and deployability in resource-constrained environments. We introduce NeuroPOL, \textit{the first neuroscience-inspired physics-informed operator learning framework} for reliability analysis. NeuroPOL incorporates Variable Spiking Neurons into a physics-informed operator architecture, replacing continuous activations with event-driven spiking dynamics. This innovation promotes sparse communication, significantly reduces computational load, and enables an energy-efficient surrogate model. The proposed framework lowers both computational and power demands, supporting real-time reliability assessment and deployment on edge devices and digital twins. By embedding governing physical laws into operator learning, NeuroPOL builds physics-consistent surrogates capable of accurate uncertainty propagation and efficient failure probability estimation, even for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate NeuroPOL on five canonical benchmarks, the Burgers equation, Nagumo equation, two-dimensional Poisson equation, two-dimensional Darcy equation, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with energy coupling. Results show that NeuroPOL achieves reliability measures comparable to standard physics-informed operators, while introducing significant communication sparsity, enabling scalable, distributed, and energy-efficient deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents struggle with adapting to new environments due to insufficient task-specific data and low-quality synthetic data in current solutions.

Method: The authors propose SynthAgent, which refines synthetic tasks and trajectories through exploration of web elements, adjusting tasks during collection to avoid errors, and performing global refinement post-collection.

Result: SynthAgent achieves superior performance compared to prior synthetic data approaches, successfully improving web agents’ adaptability.

Conclusion: High-quality synthetic data is crucial for web agents, and SynthAgent offers a robust solution, combining dual refinement methods to enhance synthetic supervision efficacy.

Abstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, we refine tasks when conflicts with actual observations are detected, mitigating hallucinations while maintaining task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with a global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SynthAgent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve current MCS weaning strategies, which lack standardization and data-driven approaches, while overcoming challenges like online interaction restrictions and limited data availability.

Method: The paper introduces an end-to-end machine learning framework, which centers on two key components: Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO) for offline RL, and a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin for modeling circulatory dynamics.

Result: The proposed CORMPO algorithm achieved 28% higher reward and 82.6% higher clinical metrics compared to offline RL baselines on real and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust and safe offline policy learning method tailored for high-stakes medical applications while emphasizing domain expertise and safety strategies.

Abstract: We study the sequential decision-making problem for automated weaning of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in cardiogenic shock patients. MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets. Our approach offers a principled framework for safe offline policy learning in high-stakes medical applications where domain expertise and safety constraints are essential.

### [446] [On the Convergence and Stability of Distributed Sub-model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06132)
*Yuyang Deng,Fuli Qiao,Mehrdad Mahdavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved sub-model training approach for federated learning using distributed shuffled sub-model training, improving convergence and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional random sampling of sub-models in federated learning lacks satisfactory convergence performance. The need for more efficient on-device local training motivates this study.

Method: The paper introduces a distributed shuffled sub-model training approach. The server partitions the model into predefined sub-models, shuffles them, assigns them to clients for local updates, and aggregates updated sub-models at the end of each round.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates improved convergence rates and generalization performance through stability analysis. Experimental validation supports these theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The distributed shuffled sub-model training approach enhances convergence and generalization in federated learning, showing promise in practical applications.

Abstract: As learning models continue to grow in size, enabling on-device local training of these models has emerged as a critical challenge in federated learning. A popular solution is sub-model training, where the server only distributes randomly sampled sub-models to the edge clients, and clients only update these small models. However, those random sampling of sub-models may not give satisfying convergence performance. In this paper, observing the success of SGD with shuffling, we propose a distributed shuffled sub-model training, where the full model is partitioned into several sub-models in advance, and the server shuffles those sub-models, sends each of them to clients at each round, and by the end of local updating period, clients send back the updated sub-models, and server averages them. We establish the convergence rate of this algorithm. We also study the generalization of distributed sub-model training via stability analysis, and find that the sub-model training can improve the generalization via amplifying the stability of training process. The extensive experiments also validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces pLAPGNN, a computationally efficient framework using weighted p-Laplacian to enhance the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of adversarial attacks on GNNs, which manipulate outcomes during training or testing, necessitating robust methods to ensure accurate and secure analysis.

Method: The authors propose pLAPGNN, leveraging weighted p-Laplacian as a novel technique to create computationally efficient and robust GNNs against adversarial attacks.

Result: Empirical evaluations on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed pLAPGNN framework in improving GNN robustness.

Conclusion: pLAPGNN effectively improves robustness in GNNs against adversarial attacks, offering a computationally efficient solution and further advancing secure graph data analysis methods.

Abstract: With the increase of data in day-to-day life, businesses and different stakeholders need to analyze the data for better predictions. Traditionally, relational data has been a source of various insights, but with the increase in computational power and the need to understand deeper relationships between entities, the need to design new techniques has arisen. For this graph data analysis has become an extraordinary tool for understanding the data, which reveals more realistic and flexible modelling of complex relationships. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and more. However, many adversarial attacks can happen over the data, whether during training (poisoning attack) or during testing (evasion attack), which can adversely manipulate the desired outcome from the GNN model. Therefore, it is crucial to make the GNNs robust to such attacks. The existing robustness methods are computationally demanding and perform poorly when the intensity of attack increases. This paper presents a computationally efficient framework, namely, pLAPGNN, based on weighted p-Laplacian for making GNNs robust. Empirical evaluation on real datasets establishes the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is computationally expensive, and there is a need for efficient methods to identify performant network architectures for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

Method: The authors utilized Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs) to evaluate architectures using a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch of data. They tested this approach on six datasets and compared outcomes against full-scale training efforts.

Conclusion: ZCPs are effective for sensor-based HAR, reducing computational costs and remaining robust to practical challenges such as data noise.

Abstract: A promising alternative to the computationally expensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS) involves the development of \textit{Zero Cost Proxies (ZCPs)}, which correlate well to trained performance, but can be computed through a single forward/backward pass on a randomly sampled batch of data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ZCPs for HAR on six benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that they discover network architectures that obtain within 5\% of performance attained by full scale training involving 1500 randomly sampled architectures. This results in substantial computational savings as high performing architectures can be discovered with minimal training. Our experiments not only introduce ZCPs to sensor-based HAR, but also demonstrate that they are robust to data noise, further showcasing their suitability for practical scenarios.

*Ibna Kowsar,Kazi F. Akhter,Manar D. Samad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel transfer learning approach called LATTLE for tabular data, leveraging LLMs to address the challenges of heterogeneous feature spaces and ineffective text-prompts for mixed data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning struggles with transfer learning on heterogeneous tabular data. While LLMs show promise, their performance often stagnates for structured tables, which necessitates improved methods.

Method: The method fine-tunes an LLM with source tabular data, transfers key-value projection weights to a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT), and fine-tunes gFTT on target data using cross-domain attention.

Result: The proposed LATTLE method outperforms traditional ML, state-of-the-art deep architectures, and transfer learning models on diverse datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with fewer resources.

Conclusion: LATTLE effectively enables transfer learning for heterogeneous tabular data by leveraging lightweight transformations from LLMs, proving suitable for low-resource environments and eliminating reliance on shared features or massive pre-trained models.

Abstract: Transfer learning of tabular data is non-trivial due to heterogeneity in the feature space across disparate domains. The limited success of traditional deep learning in tabular knowledge transfer can be advanced by leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, the efficacy of LLMs often stagnates for mixed data types structured in tables due to the limitations of text prompts and in-context learning. We propose a lightweight transfer learning framework that fine-tunes an LLM using source tabular data and transplants the LLM's selective $key$ and $value$ projection weights into a gated feature tokenized transformer (gFTT) built for tabular data. The gFTT model with cross-domain attention is fine-tuned using target tabular data for transfer learning, eliminating the need for shared features, LLM prompt engineering, and large-scale pretrained models. Our experiments using ten pairs of source-target data sets and 12 baselines demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LLM-attention transplant for transfer learning (LATTLE) method over traditional ML models, state-of-the-art deep tabular architectures, and transfer learning models trained on thousands to billions of tabular samples. The proposed attention transfer demonstrates an effective solution to learning relationships between data tables using an LLM in a low-resource learning environment. The source code for the proposed method is publicly available.

### [450] [Learning Gaussian DAG Models without Condition Number Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06164)
*Constantinos Daskalakis,Vardis Kandiros,Rui Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved algorithm for learning directed Gaussian Graphical Model topologies under equal-variance assumptions, overcoming issues with prior techniques that scale poorly with covariance matrix condition number.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior algorithms for learning Gaussian Graphical Models required sample complexities that scale heavily with the covariance matrix’s condition number, limiting practicality in high-dimensional cases.

Method: The paper introduces an algorithm that recovers the graph topology with sample complexity independent of the condition number, alongside a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves this under additional bounded variance assumptions.

Result: The proposed algorithm nearly achieves tight sample complexity bounds and demonstrates its effectiveness through simulations on synthetic data.

Conclusion: This study offers a practical and efficient solution for learning high-dimensional Gaussian graphs, addressing condition number-related limitations in prior works.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning the topology of a directed Gaussian Graphical Model under the equal-variance assumption, where the graph has $n$ nodes and maximum in-degree $d$. Prior work has established that $O(d \log n)$ samples are sufficient for this task. However, an important factor that is often overlooked in these analyses is the dependence on the condition number of the covariance matrix of the model. Indeed, all algorithms from prior work require a number of samples that grows polynomially with this condition number. In many cases this is unsatisfactory, since the condition number could grow polynomially with $n$, rendering these prior approaches impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we provide an algorithm that recovers the underlying graph and prove that the number of samples required is independent of the condition number. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds that nearly match the upper bound up to a $d$-factor, thus providing an almost tight characterization of the true sample complexity of the problem. Moreover, under a further assumption that all the variances of the variables are bounded, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that recovers the underlying graph, at the cost of an additional polynomial dependence of the sample complexity on $d$. We complement our theoretical findings with simulations on synthetic datasets that confirm our predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses noisy label challenges in federated learning by introducing a novel regularization technique that enhances model performance without requiring architecture compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the problem of noisy labels infiltrating federated learning's global model, causing decreased system generalizability.

Method: Proposed a local regularization technique using self-supervised pretrained models to decouple pre-trained and classification models, enforcing similarity between close data points.

Result: The approach significantly enhances performance in federated learning, outperforming existing methods across computer vision and medical image benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method is effective at reducing noise impact and is architecture-agnostic, enabling flexibility without increasing communication costs due to large model sizes.

Abstract: Federated learning on clients with noisy labels is a challenging problem, as such clients can infiltrate the global model, impacting the overall generalizability of the system. Existing methods proposed to handle noisy clients assume that a sufficient number of clients with clean labels are available, which can be leveraged to learn a robust global model while dampening the impact of noisy clients. This assumption fails when a high number of heterogeneous clients contain noisy labels, making the existing approaches ineffective. In such scenarios, it is important to locally regularize the clients before communication with the global model, to ensure the global model isn't corrupted by noisy clients. While pre-trained self-supervised models can be effective for local regularization, existing centralized approaches relying on pretrained initialization are impractical in a federated setting due to the potentially large size of these models, which increases communication costs. In that line, we propose a regularization objective for client models that decouples the pre-trained and classification models by enforcing similarity between close data points within the client. We leverage the representation space of a self-supervised pretrained model to evaluate the closeness among examples. This regularization, when applied with the standard objective function for the downstream task in standard noisy federated settings, significantly improves performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art federated methods in multiple computer vision and medical image classification benchmarks. Unlike other techniques that rely on self-supervised pretrained initialization, our method does not require the pretrained model and classifier backbone to share the same architecture, making it architecture-agnostic.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI) problem and proposes SC-RIHN, a hypergraph model, to predict supply chain resilience and outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience, a challenging problem due to higher-order, multi-entity dependencies and lack of explicit dynamics modeling.

Method: A novel hypergraph-based model, SC-RIHN, employing set-based encoding and message passing to capture interactions within supply chain networks.

Result: SC-RIHN demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional methods in synthetic benchmarks, validating its efficacy for resilience prediction.

Conclusion: SC-RIHN's ability to address the SCRI problem offers substantial contributions to assessing and improving supply chain resilience, supporting risk mitigation and network design.

Abstract: Supply chains are integral to global economic stability, yet disruptions can swiftly propagate through interconnected networks, resulting in substantial economic impacts. Accurate and timely inference of supply chain resilience the capability to maintain core functions during disruptions is crucial for proactive risk mitigation and robust network design. However, existing approaches lack effective mechanisms to infer supply chain resilience without explicit system dynamics and struggle to represent the higher-order, multi-entity dependencies inherent in supply chain networks. These limitations motivate the definition of a novel problem and the development of targeted modeling solutions. To address these challenges, we formalize a novel problem: Supply Chain Resilience Inference (SCRI), defined as predicting supply chain resilience using hypergraph topology and observed inventory trajectories without explicit dynamic equations. To solve this problem, we propose the Supply Chain Resilience Inference Hypergraph Network (SC-RIHN), a novel hypergraph-based model leveraging set-based encoding and hypergraph message passing to capture multi-party firm-product interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SC-RIHN significantly outperforms traditional MLP, representative graph neural network variants, and ResInf baselines across synthetic benchmarks, underscoring its potential for practical, early-warning risk assessment in complex supply chain systems.

*Yanan Zhao,Feng Ji,Jingyang Dai,Jiaze Ma,Keyue Jiang,Kai Zhao,Wee Peng Tay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an augmentation-free multi-view graph contrastive learning (GCL) framework using fractional-order continuous dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCL methods are limited by the use of fixed and handcrafted views, which hampers their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns effectively.

Method: The proposed framework varies the fractional derivative order α within (0,1] to produce a continuous spectrum of views, from localized features to global aggregation. α is treated as a learnable parameter, enabling adaptive and automatic discovery of informative views.

Result: The method generates robust and expressive embeddings, outperforming state-of-the-art GCL baselines across standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach avoids manual augmentations, offers diverse and complementary representations, and advances robustness and expressiveness in graph representations.

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) learns node and graph representations by contrasting multiple views of the same graph. Existing methods typically rely on fixed, handcrafted views-usually a local and a global perspective, which limits their ability to capture multi-scale structural patterns. We present an augmentation-free, multi-view GCL framework grounded in fractional-order continuous dynamics. By varying the fractional derivative order $α\in (0,1]$, our encoders produce a continuous spectrum of views: small $α$ yields localized features, while large $α$ induces broader, global aggregation. We treat $α$ as a learnable parameter so the model can adapt diffusion scales to the data and automatically discover informative views. This principled approach generates diverse, complementary representations without manual augmentations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method produces more robust and expressive embeddings and outperforms state-of-the-art GCL baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes solving the dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE) problem using model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offering significant accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in microscopic traffic simulations, specifically the credit assignment problem caused by temporal dynamics and uncertainty in vehicle movements.

Method: The DODE problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), employing deep reinforcement learning to develop an optimal policy for OD matrix generation with simulation interactions.

Result: The proposed DRL framework reduced mean squared error (MSE) by 43.2% compared to conventional baseline methods during validation on the Nguyen-Dupuis network.

Conclusion: The framework effectively tackles the credit assignment challenge, presenting a novel calibration approach for enhancing microscopic traffic simulations.

Abstract: This paper focuses on dynamic origin-destination matrix estimation (DODE), a crucial calibration process necessary for the effective application of microscopic traffic simulations. The fundamental challenge of the DODE problem in microscopic simulations stems from the complex temporal dynamics and inherent uncertainty of individual vehicle dynamics. This makes it highly challenging to precisely determine which vehicle traverses which link at any given moment, resulting in intricate and often ambiguous relationships between origin-destination (OD) matrices and their contributions to resultant link flows. This phenomenon constitutes the credit assignment problem, a central challenge addressed in this study. We formulate the DODE problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel framework that applies model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Within our proposed framework, the agent learns an optimal policy to sequentially generate OD matrices, refining its strategy through direct interaction with the simulation environment. The proposed method is validated on the Nguyen-Dupuis network using SUMO, where its performance is evaluated against ground-truth link flows aggregated at 5-minute intervals over a 30-minute horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 43.2% reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to the best-performing conventional baseline. By reframing DODE as a sequential decision-making problem, our approach addresses the credit assignment challenge through its learned policy, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional methods and proposing a novel framework for calibration of microscopic traffic simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current emotion recognition systems mainly rely on cloud-based computation, which introduces privacy concerns and latency issues for real-time applications.

Method: The authors compare classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset, focusing on performance and efficiency for on-device processing.

Result: Classical ensemble methods outperform deep learning: ExtraTrees achieves an F1 score of 0.826 (combined features) and 0.623 (wrist-only), while transformers score around 0.509-0.577. Optimized models using ONNX yield significant reductions in storage and inference times.

Conclusion: This study highlights the feasibility of deploying optimized classical ensemble models for privacy-preserving and efficient on-device emotion recognition in wearable devices.

Abstract: Human-computer interaction increasingly demands systems that recognize not only explicit user inputs but also implicit emotional states. While substantial progress has been made in affective computing, most emotion recognition systems rely on cloud-based inference, introducing privacy vulnerabilities and latency constraints unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning architectures for on-device emotion recognition from wrist-based photoplethysmography (PPG), systematically comparing different models spanning classical ensemble methods, deep neural networks, and transformers on the WESAD stress detection dataset. Results demonstrate that classical ensemble methods substantially outperform deep learning on small physiological datasets, with ExtraTrees achieving F1 = 0.826 on combined features and F1 = 0.623 on wrist-only features, compared to transformers achieving only F1 = 0.509-0.577. We deploy the wrist-only ExtraTrees model optimized via ONNX conversion, achieving a 4.08 MB footprint, 0.05 ms inference latency, and 152x speedup over the original implementation. Furthermore, ONNX optimization yields a 30.5% average storage reduction and 40.1x inference speedup, highlighting the feasibility of privacy-preserving on-device emotion recognition for real-world wearables.

*Sushant Mehta,Ishan Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical framework explaining how in-context learning (ICL) emerges in transformers by connecting scaling laws with model dimensions and task structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how large language models adapt to new tasks through demonstrations without parameter updates is currently unclear despite broad empirical usage.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework linking scaling laws (model depth, width, context length, etc.) to ICL performance and derive phase transitions and optimal model configurations for efficient ICL.

Result: Findings show power-law relationships between ICL performance and model parameters and establish effective conditions for gradient-based metalearning within transformers.

Conclusion: The paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for ICL emergence, validates scaling laws empirically, and outlines limitations on transformer learning capacities in-context.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models to adapt to new tasks from demonstrations without parameter updates. Despite extensive empirical studies, a principled understanding of ICL emergence at scale remains more elusive. We present a unified theoretical framework connecting scaling laws to ICL emergence in transformers. Our analysis establishes that ICL performance follows power-law relationships with model depth $L$, width $d$, context length $k$, and training data $D$, with exponents determined by task structure. We show that under specific conditions, transformers implement gradient-based metalearning in their forward pass, with an effective learning rate $η_{\text{eff}} = Θ(1/\sqrt{Ld})$. We demonstrate sharp phase transitions at critical scales and derive optimal depth-width allocations favoring $L^* \propto N^{2/3}$, $d^* \propto N^{1/3}$ for the fixed parameter budget $N = Ld$. Systematic experiments on synthetic tasks validate our predictions, with measured scaling exponents closely matching theory. This work provides both necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of ICLs and establishes fundamental computational limits on what transformers can learn in-context.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MoSEs, a framework for continual learning in LLMs, focusing on overcoming challenges of catastrophic forgetting and scalability through sparse subexpert integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods in LLMs struggle with catastrophic forgetting and fail to support scalable continual learning across tasks without compromising prior knowledge or requiring extensive model size growth.

Method: The authors propose MoSEs, integrating sparse Mixtures of SubExperts with task-specific routing. This enables isolation of knowledge, parameter protection, adaptive sparse parameter reuse, and sublinear model size growth.

Result: MoSEs achieve improved performance on TRACE benchmark datasets in terms of knowledge retention, scalability, computational, and memory efficiency compared to traditional continual learning methods.

Conclusion: MoSEs successfully address continual learning challenges by balancing scalability, knowledge retention, efficient resource usage, and state-of-the-art outcomes.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to a continuous stream of tasks is a critical yet challenging endeavor. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become a standard for this, they face a fundamental dilemma in continual learning. Reusing a single set of PEFT parameters for new tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Conversely, allocating distinct parameters for each task prevents forgetting but results in a linear growth of the model's size and fails to facilitate knowledge transfer between related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive PEFT method referred to as \textit{Mixtures of SubExperts (MoSEs)}, a novel continual learning framework designed for minimal forgetting and efficient scalability. MoSEs integrate a sparse Mixture of SubExperts into the transformer layers, governed by a task-specific routing mechanism. This architecture allows the model to isolate and protect knowledge within dedicated SubExperts, thereby minimizing parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, the router can adaptively select and combine previously learned sparse parameters for new tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer while ensuring that the model's capacity grows sublinearly. We evaluate MoSEs on the comprehensive TRACE benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that MoSEs significantly outperform conventional continual learning approaches in both knowledge retention and scalability to new tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with substantial memory and computational savings.

TL;DR: AGRAG addresses challenges in Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation by improving graph construction, reasoning, and answering through advanced statistical and algorithmic techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph-based RAG methods suffer from LLM hallucination, poor reasoning ability, and inadequate answering, which degrades task performance.

Method: AGRAG replaces LLM-based entity extraction with a statistics-based method and frames graph reasoning as a Minimum Cost Maximum Influence problem solved using a greedy algorithm.

Result: AGRAG improves reasoning ability and query relevancy by generating comprehensive reasoning paths and incorporating complex graph structures.

Conclusion: AGRAG is a robust framework that enhances Graph-based RAG by reducing hallucination, improving reasoning paths, and allowing complex graph structures.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths.

Result: IEC reduces error propagation from exponential to linear growth during inference, and experiments demonstrate consistent quality improvements across datasets, techniques, and model architectures.

Conclusion: IEC offers a practical and generalizable method for enhancing generation quality of efficient diffusion models during inference, addressing performance-efficiency trade-offs effectively.

Abstract: With the growing demand for high-quality image generation on resource-constrained devices, efficient diffusion models have received increasing attention. However, such models suffer from approximation errors introduced by efficiency techniques, which significantly degrade generation quality. Once deployed, these errors are difficult to correct, as modifying the model is typically infeasible in deployment environments. Through an analysis of error propagation across diffusion timesteps, we reveal that these approximation errors can accumulate exponentially, severely impairing output quality. Motivated by this insight, we propose Iterative Error Correction (IEC), a novel test-time method that mitigates inference-time errors by iteratively refining the model's output. IEC is theoretically proven to reduce error propagation from exponential to linear growth, without requiring any retraining or architectural changes. IEC can seamlessly integrate into the inference process of existing diffusion models, enabling a flexible trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that IEC consistently improves generation quality across various datasets, efficiency techniques, and model architectures, establishing it as a practical and generalizable solution for test-time enhancement of efficient diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MrCoM, a model-based reinforcement learning framework that enhances generalization across different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-based reinforcement learning methods lack generalization capabilities across different scenarios, focusing primarily on single-task applications.

Method: The authors propose MrCoM, which uses latent state decomposition and meta-regularization techniques to improve prediction accuracy and alignment of world-model optimization with policy learning in multi-scenario settings.

Result: MrCoM demonstrates superior generalization performance across scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the paper presents theoretical analysis of its generalization error bounds.

Conclusion: MrCoM achieves effective generalization in multi-scenario settings, marking a significant improvement over existing MBRL approaches.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is a crucial approach to enhance the generalization capabilities and improve the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, current MBRL methods focus primarily on building world models for single tasks and rarely address generalization across different scenarios. Building on the insight that dynamics within the same simulation engine share inherent properties, we attempt to construct a unified world model capable of generalizing across different scenarios, named Meta-Regularized Contextual World-Model (MrCoM). This method first decomposes the latent state space into various components based on the dynamic characteristics, thereby enhancing the accuracy of world-model prediction. Further, MrCoM adopts meta-state regularization to extract unified representation of scenario-relevant information, and meta-value regularization to align world-model optimization with policy learning across diverse scenario objectives. We theoretically analyze the generalization error upper bound of MrCoM in multi-scenario settings. We systematically evaluate our algorithm's generalization ability across diverse scenarios, demonstrating significantly better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes GLMR, a novel framework that improves molecular retrieval from mass spectra using a generative and contrastive learning-based approach, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current molecular retrieval methods face limitations due to restricted spectral library coverage and modality misalignment in cross-modal frameworks.

Method: GLMR employs a two-stage process: contrastive learning identifies top candidate molecules, and a generative model refines molecular structures for improved candidate ranking.

Result: GLMR achieves over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and demonstrates strong generalization on MassSpecGym and the new MassRET-20k dataset.

Conclusion: GLMR overcomes traditional challenges in molecular retrieval and sets a new benchmark with high retrieval accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Retrieving molecular structures from tandem mass spectra is a crucial step in rapid compound identification. Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for efficient deployment of deep learning algorithms on resource- and energy-constrained systems by leveraging neural pruning for high compression gain without compromising performance.

Method: The authors propose CAMP-HiVe, a neural pruning approach based on Hessian-vector approximations and cyclic pair merging to iteratively preserve significant weights while maintaining a balance between model accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed method significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy across neural network architectures like ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2 tested on benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). It outperforms existing state-of-the-art neural pruning techniques.

Conclusion: CAMP-HiVe demonstrates its ability to streamline models efficiently, ensuring scalability and adaptability for various architectures and datasets while enhancing performance compared to existing pruning approaches.

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential component of many artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications, many of which run on resource-constrained and energy-constrained systems. For efficient deployment of these algorithms, although different techniques for the compression of neural network models are proposed, neural pruning is one of the fastest and effective methods, which can provide a high compression gain with minimal cost. To harness enhanced performance gain with respect to model complexity, we propose a novel neural network pruning approach utilizing Hessian-vector products that approximate crucial curvature information in the loss function, which significantly reduces the computation demands. By employing a power iteration method, our algorithm effectively identifies and preserves the essential information, ensuring a balanced trade-off between model accuracy and computational efficiency. Herein, we introduce CAMP-HiVe, a cyclic pair merging-based pruning with Hessian Vector approximation by iteratively consolidating weight pairs, combining significant and less significant weights, thus effectively streamlining the model while preserving its performance. This dynamic, adaptive framework allows for real-time adjustment of weight significance, ensuring that only the most critical parameters are retained. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant reductions in computational requirements while maintaining high performance across different neural network architectures, e.g., ResNet18, ResNet56, and MobileNetv2, on standard benchmark datasets, e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, and it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art neural pruning methods.

Result: Experiments show COTN surpasses advanced models like Informer by up to 17% and classic statistical approaches like GARCH by 40%, showcasing its ability to manage volatility effectively.

Conclusion: COTN is a robust forecasting framework for chaotic and volatile systems, demonstrating strong performance in practical applications with measurable improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial and electricity markets, especially under extreme conditions, remains a significant challenge due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, rapid fluctuations, and chaotic patterns. To address these limitations, we propose the Chaotic Oscillatory Transformer Network (COTN). COTN innovatively combines a Transformer architecture with a novel Lee Oscillator activation function, processed through Max-over-Time pooling and a lambda-gating mechanism. This design is specifically tailored to effectively capture chaotic dynamics and improve responsiveness during periods of heightened volatility, where conventional activation functions (e.g., ReLU, GELU) tend to saturate. Furthermore, COTN incorporates an Autoencoder Self-Regressive (ASR) module to detect and isolate abnormal market patterns, such as sudden price spikes or crashes, thereby preventing corruption of the core prediction process and enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments across electricity spot markets and financial markets demonstrate the practical applicability and resilience of COTN. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models like Informer by up to 17% and traditional statistical methods like GARCH by as much as 40%. These results underscore COTN's effectiveness in navigating real-world market uncertainty and complexity, offering a powerful tool for forecasting highly volatile systems under duress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of ensuring fairness in machine learning models, especially in human-centered, high-stakes domains where any loss in predictive performance can have serious consequences.

Method: The paper introduces a "fairness-without-harm" approach that involves learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and utilizing group-specific experts with personalized classifiers under a no-harm constraint.

Result: The proposed method was tested on three medical datasets and two face datasets, showing strong empirical evidence of achieving fairness while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that fairness in machine learning can be achieved without degrading predictive performance, offering a valuable solution for ethical and practical challenges in sensitive domains like healthcare.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into human-centered domains such as healthcare, ensuring fairness while maintaining high predictive performance is critical. Existing bias mitigation techniques often impose a trade-off between fairness and accuracy, inadvertently degrading performance for certain demographic groups. In high-stakes domains like clinical diagnosis, such trade-offs are ethically and practically unacceptable. In this study, we propose a fairness-without-harm approach by learning distinct representations for different demographic groups and selectively applying demographic experts consisting of group-specific representations and personalized classifiers through a no-harm constrained selection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world medical datasets -- covering eye disease, skin cancer, and X-ray diagnosis -- as well as two face datasets. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving fairness without harm.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in Transformer-based Neural Operators for PDEs, particularly focusing on reducing computational cost and parameter count without compromising performance.

Method: The paper builds on observations that slice and deslice operations are more effective than slice attention. It reformulates Physics-Attention as a linear attention mechanism, creating LinearNO.

Result: LinearNO achieves state-of-the-art results on six PDE benchmarks and outperforms existing methods on challenging industrial datasets like AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

Conclusion: LinearNO provides a more efficient and effective solution for data-driven PDE solvers, transforming Physics-Attention into canonical linear attention, with substantial gains in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer-based Neural Operators have enabled significant progress in data-driven solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Most current research has focused on reducing the quadratic complexity of attention to address the resulting low training and inference efficiency. Among these works, Transolver stands out as a representative method that introduces Physics-Attention to reduce computational costs. Physics-Attention projects grid points into slices for slice attention, then maps them back through deslicing. However, we observe that Physics-Attention can be reformulated as a special case of linear attention, and that the slice attention may even hurt the model performance. Based on these observations, we argue that its effectiveness primarily arises from the slice and deslice operations rather than interactions between slices. Building on this insight, we propose a two-step transformation to redesign Physics-Attention into a canonical linear attention, which we call Linear Attention Neural Operator (LinearNO). Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on six standard PDE benchmarks, while reducing the number of parameters by an average of 40.0% and computational cost by 36.2%. Additionally, it delivers superior performance on two challenging, industrial-level datasets: AirfRANS and Shape-Net Car.

TL;DR: This paper presents 3dSAGER, a pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects using geometry-based features independent of spatial reference systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for effective geospatial entity resolution across datasets collected from different sources with varying conditions, where traditional proximity-based methods fail due to their limitations.

Method: The proposed method, 3dSAGER, uses intrinsic 3D geometry for entity resolution and introduces BKAFI, a blocking method for generating candidate sets efficiently.

Result: Experiments on real-world urban datasets showed 3dSAGER achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: 3dSAGER addresses key challenges in geospatial entity resolution, offering robust and scalable solutions while contributing valuable insights into its design and components.

Abstract: Urban environments are continuously mapped and modeled by various data collection platforms, including satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and street cameras. The growing availability of 3D geospatial data from multiple modalities has introduced new opportunities and challenges for integrating spatial knowledge at scale, particularly in high-impact domains such as urban planning and rapid disaster management. Geospatial entity resolution is the task of identifying matching spatial objects across different datasets, often collected independently under varying conditions. Existing approaches typically rely on spatial proximity, textual metadata, or external identifiers to determine correspondence. While useful, these signals are often unavailable, unreliable, or misaligned, especially in cross-source scenarios. To address these limitations, we shift the focus to the intrinsic geometry of 3D spatial objects and present 3dSAGER (3D Spatial-Aware Geospatial Entity Resolution), an end-to-end pipeline for geospatial entity resolution over 3D objects. 3dSAGER introduces a novel, spatial-reference-independent featurization mechanism that captures intricate geometric characteristics of matching pairs, enabling robust comparison even across datasets with incompatible coordinate systems where traditional spatial methods fail. As a key component of 3dSAGER, we also propose a new lightweight and interpretable blocking method, BKAFI, that leverages a trained model to efficiently generate high-recall candidate sets. We validate 3dSAGER through extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets, demonstrating significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency over strong baselines. Our empirical study further dissects the contributions of each component, providing insights into their impact and the overall design choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of RL algorithms and data curation for competitive-programming code generation and improve reasoning-driven coding models.

Method: The authors propose a two-stage RL training process: (1) training on diverse competitive-programming problems using GRPO to reduce repetition and truncation; (2) fine-tuning using Pre-GRPO on challenging problems with a focused curriculum and large rollout budgets.

Result: Their method implemented on Qwen2.5-32B achieves state-of-the-art performance in competitive-programming code generation, comparable to leading models like DeepSeek v3.1.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates strong RL scaling and distills effective practices for data curation, entropy expansion, and curriculum design, enhancing RLVR for competitive-programming code generation.

Abstract: Recent reasoning-first models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have spurred a resurgence of interest in RLVR. Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model. Our study distills concise best practices for data curation, entropy expansion, and curriculum design in RLVR for competitive-programming code generation.

Motivation: Address persistent challenges in reaction prediction models, including sensitivity to molecule/atom orderings and inadequate representation of substructural interactions.

Method: The introduction of ReaDISH featuring (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding for order-insensitivity and structural change analysis, and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention for inter- and intra-molecular interaction modeling.

Result: ReaDISH shows significant improvements in reaction prediction benchmarks, with an average robustness improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation disturbances.

Conclusion: ReaDISH effectively addresses critical limitations in reaction prediction, enhancing both accuracy and robustness through innovative encoding and interaction modeling techniques.

Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which computes molecular shingle differences to capture reaction-specific structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedFair-Traffic, a privacy-preserving federated learning framework aimed at optimizing travel efficiency, fairness in traffic, and privacy protection in urban transportation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current centralized traffic management systems compromise user privacy and exacerbate socioeconomic traffic inequalities. Existing federated learning frameworks do not integrate fairness considerations in multi-objective traffic optimization.

Method: The methodology integrates privacy-preserving federated learning with Graph Neural Networks and differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy) while incorporating fairness constraints based on Gini coefficients through multi-objective optimization.

Result: FedFair-Traffic reduces average travel time by 7%, increases traffic fairness by 73%, improves privacy protection significantly, and reduces communication overhead by 89%, based on experiments on the METR-LA dataset.

Conclusion: FedFair-Traffic demonstrates scalability as a privacy-aware and efficient infrastructure for smart city traffic flow control, ensuring fairness, privacy, and optimal travel efficiency.

Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($ε$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.

TL;DR: The paper examines the role of positional encoding in Transformers for vocabulary in-context learning (VICL), finding it necessary for achieving universal approximation properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations and benefits of positional encoding for enabling universal approximation in vocabulary in-context learning with Transformers.

Method: Analyzed single-layer Transformers with and without positional encoding, and provided sufficient conditions where positional encodings enable universal approximation.

Result: Single-layer Transformers without positional encoding do not achieve universal approximation; positional encoding can enable it under certain sufficient conditions.

Conclusion: Positional encoding enhances the universal approximation properties in Transformers, highlighting its importance in the context of in-context learning.

Abstract: Numerous studies have demonstrated that the Transformer architecture possesses the capability for in-context learning (ICL). In scenarios involving function approximation, context can serve as a control parameter for the model, endowing it with the universal approximation property (UAP). In practice, context is represented by tokens from a finite set, referred to as a vocabulary, which is the case considered in this paper, \emph{i.e.}, vocabulary in-context learning (VICL). We demonstrate that VICL in single-layer Transformers, without positional encoding, does not possess the UAP; however, it is possible to achieve the UAP when positional encoding is included. Several sufficient conditions for the positional encoding are provided. Our findings reveal the benefits of positional encoding from an approximation theory perspective in the context of ICL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces context-guided Test-time Reinforcement Learning (CG-TTRL), improving performance and efficiency during test-time training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTRL has proven effective for adapting foundation models at test-time, but its two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which could enhance performance and efficiency.

Method: The authors propose CG-TTRL by dynamically integrating context into both phases of TTRL’s sampling strategy, combined with efficient context selection for on-device applications.

Result: CG-TTRL demonstrates a 7% relative accuracy improvement and strong efficiency gains, such as 8% accuracy improvement with fewer test-time training steps compared to TTRL.

Conclusion: CG-TTRL outperforms traditional TTRL by leveraging context during sampling, enhancing accuracy and efficiency for complex tasks at test time.

Abstract: Test-time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) has shown promise in adapting foundation models for complex tasks at test-time, resulting in large performance improvements. TTRL leverages an elegant two-phase sampling strategy: first, multi-sampling derives a pseudo-label via majority voting, while subsequent downsampling and reward-based fine-tuning encourages the model to explore and learn diverse valid solutions, with the pseudo-label modulating the reward signal. Meanwhile, in-context learning has been widely explored at inference time and demonstrated the ability to enhance model performance without weight updates. However, TTRL's two-phase sampling strategy under-utilizes contextual guidance, which can potentially improve pseudo-label accuracy in the initial exploitation phase while regulating exploration in the second. To address this, we propose context-guided TTRL (CG-TTRL), integrating context dynamically into both sampling phases and propose a method for efficient context selection for on-device applications. Our evaluations on mathematical and scientific QA benchmarks show CG-TTRL outperforms TTRL (e.g. additional 7% relative accuracy improvement over TTRL), while boosting efficiency by obtaining strong performance after only a few steps of test-time training (e.g. 8% relative improvement rather than 1% over TTRL after 3 steps).

TL;DR: The paper introduces the C3E framework to optimize hidden dimensions and propagation depths in graph neural networks, mitigating over-squashing and improving representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks suffer from over-squashing due to suboptimal choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depth, necessitating an optimized solution to improve information propagation and representation learning.

Method: The authors propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a framework using nonlinear programming and information theory to model these parameters in spectral graph neural networks as communication channels.

Result: C3E demonstrated improvement in mitigating over-squashing and enhancing representation learning in experiments over nine public datasets. Key findings reveal that hidden dimensions affect information compression and propagation, while propagation depth requires careful balance.

Conclusion: C3E effectively addresses over-squashing in graph neural networks by optimizing hidden dimensions and propagation depth, unveiling crucial insights into the trade-off between information compression and complexity.

Abstract: Existing graph neural networks typically rely on heuristic choices for hidden dimensions and propagation depths, which often lead to severe information loss during propagation, known as over-squashing. To address this issue, we propose Channel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that formulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear programming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral graph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects channel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation mechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets demonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate over-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental results show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of information in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that increasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the role of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance between information compression and representation complexity.

Result: FLEX improved performance on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction by up to 23%, 10%, and 14%, respectively.

Conclusion: FLEX provides a scalable and inheritable framework for continuous experiential growth, advancing LLM agents closer to dynamic and evolving intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized reasoning and problem-solving but remain static after training, unable to grow with experience as intelligent beings do during deployment. We introduce Forward Learning with EXperience (FLEX), a gradient-free learning paradigm that enables LLM agents to continuously evolve through accumulated experience. Specifically, FLEX cultivates scalable and inheritable evolution by constructing a structured experience library through continual reflection on successes and failures during interaction with the environment. FLEX delivers substantial improvements on mathematical reasoning, chemical retrosynthesis, and protein fitness prediction (up to 23% on AIME25, 10% on USPTO50k, and 14% on ProteinGym). We further identify a clear scaling law of experiential growth and the phenomenon of experience inheritance across agents, marking a step toward scalable and inheritable continuous agent evolution.

*Jian'an Zhang*

TL;DR: ARBITER is a neural operator model designed for learning joint SPX-VIX term structures under strict no-arbitrage constraints, outperforming existing models in stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate modeling of SPX-VIX term structures while enforcing no-arbitrage constraints, addressing gaps in dynamic arbitrage-free derivatives modeling.

Method: ARBITER integrates an operator learning framework with constrained decoders, utilizing extragradient-style updates and projections for training no-arbitrage neural operators.

Result: ARBITER achieves tighter bounds on Dual-Gap, improves NI, stabilizes calibration, and generalizes better over horizons compared to Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and other sequence models.

Conclusion: ARBITER successfully enforces no-arbitrage constraints and provides practical recipes for arbitrage-free interpolation and extrapolation across maturities and strikes, offering superior metrics and performance on SPX and VIX data.

Abstract: We propose ARBITER, a risk-neutral neural operator for learning joint SPX-VIX term structures under no-arbitrage constraints. ARBITER maps market states to an operator that outputs implied volatility and variance curves while enforcing static arbitrage (calendar, vertical, butterfly), Lipschitz bounds, and monotonicity. The model couples operator learning with constrained decoders and is trained with extragradient-style updates plus projection. We introduce evaluation metrics for derivatives term structures (NAS, CNAS, NI, Dual-Gap, Stability Rate) and show gains over Fourier Neural Operator, DeepONet, and state-space sequence models on historical SPX and VIX data. Ablation studies indicate that tying the SPX and VIX legs reduces Dual-Gap and improves NI, Lipschitz projection stabilizes calibration, and selective state updates improve long-horizon generalization. We provide identifiability and approximation results and describe practical recipes for arbitrage-free interpolation and extrapolation across maturities and strikes.

*Leyan Xue,Zongbo Han,Kecheng Xue,Xiaohong Liu,Guangyu Wang,Changqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal fusion progress is limited by insufficient benchmarks for evaluation. The study introduces a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark with 30 datasets for 15 modalities and 20 tasks, alongside an automated evaluation pipeline to set new performance baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal fusion methods, which hinders progress and leads to biased model evaluations and a lack of generalization.

Method: Developed a large-scale benchmark integrating 30 datasets across 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks, complemented by an open-source, unified evaluation pipeline.

Result: Established new performance baselines via large-scale experiments and promoted standardized evaluation of multimodal models.

Conclusion: The work provides an essential platform for rigorous assessment, aiming to advance multimodal AI research and practice.

Abstract: Although multimodal fusion has made significant progress, its advancement is severely hindered by the lack of adequate evaluation benchmarks. Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the task of locating a target point through noisy distance queries, focusing on reconstruction error using geometry concepts and asymptotic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to analyze the trade-off between accurate recovery of a target point and limiting information disclosure in applications like GPS, sensor networks, and privacy-aware data access.

Method: The approach uses a learning-theoretic analysis of the problem, employing geometric concepts like Chebyshev radius to characterize optimal reconstruction errors.

Result: The paper presents tight geometric bounds on the optimal reconstruction error for compact metric spaces and analyzes asymptotic reconstruction behavior, distinguishing pseudo-finite and nontrivial decay spaces.

Conclusion: It provides key insights into determining the reconstruction error in various metric spaces and characterizes conditions like pseudo-finiteness for specific spaces such as convex Euclidean spaces.

Abstract: Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.

TL;DR: This paper refines the neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV) method by establishing error bounds and proving convergence properties, ensuring stability and efficiency in data valuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data valuation methods lack assurance of validity within a single training process, which limits their stability and effectiveness.

Method: The study builds upon the NDDV method, introducing error estimation and convergence analysis under certain mathematical assumptions (Lipschitz and smoothness conditions).

Result: Demonstrated quadratic error bounds for loss differences, vanishing gradient norms for training loss, and sublinear convergence of meta-loss during iterations.

Conclusion: The refined NDDV approach ensures stable and efficient data valuation through robust error and convergence analysis.

Abstract: Data valuation quantifies data importance, but existing methods cannot ensure validity in a single training process. The neural dynamic data valuation (NDDV) method [3] addresses this limitation. Based on NDDV, we are the first to explore error estimation and convergence analysis in data valuation. Under Lipschitz and smoothness assumptions, we derive quadratic error bounds for loss differences that scale inversely with time steps and quadratically with control variations, ensuring stability. We also prove that the expected squared gradient norm for the training loss vanishes asymptotically, and that the meta loss converges sublinearly over iterations. In particular, NDDV achieves sublinear convergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DyKAF, a novel optimizer using dynamical Kronecker approximations, improves Fisher matrix representation and achieves superior performance in large language model tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of constructing efficient and accurate structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners for optimization.

Method: The paper introduces DyKAF, an optimizer leveraging projector-splitting integrators to dynamically approximate the Fisher matrix in a Kronecker-factorized form.

Result: DyKAF demonstrated superior performance over existing optimizers in experiments involving large language model pre-training and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DyKAF effectively enhances the quality of Fisher matrix approximations and offers improved outcomes in various optimization tasks.

Abstract: Recently, optimizers that explicitly treat weights as matrices, rather than flattened vectors, have demonstrated their effectiveness. This perspective naturally leads to structured approximations of the Fisher matrix as preconditioners, where the matrix view induces a Kronecker-factorized form that enables memory-efficient representation. However, constructing such approximations both efficiently and accurately remains an open challenge, since obtaining the optimal factorization is resource-intensive and practical methods therefore rely on heuristic design choices. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages projector-splitting integrators to construct effective preconditioners. Our optimizer, DyKAF (Dynamical Kronecker Approximation of the Fisher Matrix), consistently improves the Fisher matrix approximation quality. Experiments on large language model pre-training and fine-tuning demonstrate that DyKAF outperforms existing optimizers across a range of evaluation metrics.

While recent machine learning models have shown promise in predicting sepsis onset, their black-box nature limits interpretability and clinical trust. In this study, we present an interpretable AI approach for sepsis analysis that integrates machine learning with clinical knowledge. Our method not only delivers accurate predictions of sepsis onset but also enables clinicians to understand, validate, and align model outputs with established medical expertise.

*Sivaram Krishnan,Jinho Choi,Jihong Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to analyze and predict dynamic graph data using Koopman autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world data, like sea measurements and UAV trajectories, can be represented as graphs that change over time. Modeling such graphs effectively is essential for tasks like prediction and data reconstruction.

Method: The framework converts time-varying graph data into vector time series through graph embedding and applies Koopman autoencoder in a latent space to learn non-linear dynamics for analysis.

Result: This method offers the ability to predict graph evolution and reconstruct missing data.

Conclusion: Koopman autoencoder provides a systematic way to capture and analyze the temporal dynamics of time-varying graph data, addressing prediction and reconstruction challenges.

Abstract: A wide variety of real-world data, such as sea measurements, e.g., temperatures collected by distributed sensors and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectories, can be naturally represented as graphs, often exhibiting non-Euclidean structures. These graph representations may evolve over time, forming time-varying graphs. Effectively modeling and analyzing such dynamic graph data is critical for tasks like predicting graph evolution and reconstructing missing graph data. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Koopman autoencoder (KAE) to handle time-varying graph data. Specifically, we assume the existence of a hidden non-linear dynamical system, where the state vector corresponds to the graph embedding of the time-varying graph signals. To capture the evolving graph structures, the graph data is first converted into a vector time series through graph embedding, representing the structural information in a finite-dimensional latent space. In this latent space, the KAE is applied to learn the underlying non-linear dynamics governing the temporal evolution of graph features, enabling both prediction and reconstruction tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SeqTopK, a new adaptive routing strategy for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models, improving token complexity handling while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adaptive routing methods in MoE architectures are often inefficient or require complex retraining processes. Standard TopK routing does not handle token complexity dynamically, motivating the need for an efficient dynamic allocation strategy.

Method: SeqTopK shifts expert allocation from token level to sequence level, assigning experts dynamically to tokens based on their complexity while preserving the overall expert budget. It requires minimal code changes and is compatible with pretrained models.

Result: SeqTopK demonstrates consistent improvements in diverse tasks such as math, coding, law, and writing, with performance gains up to 16.9% under higher sparsity conditions.

Conclusion: SeqTopK is a minimal, efficient, and scalable routing method for MoE models, making it suitable for next-generation LLMs under extreme sparsity conditions.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per token, but the standard TopK routing assigns the same fixed number of experts to all tokens, ignoring their varying complexity. Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%). These results highlight SeqTopK as a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy, particularly well-suited for the extreme sparsity regimes of next-generation LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Y-Research-SBU/SeqTopK.

*Navin Khoshnan,Claudia K Petritsch,Bryce-Allen Bagley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm for high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems identification via Volterra series, addressing computational bottlenecks by utilizing localized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in identifying high-dimensional systems using Volterra series, specifically the computational and memory challenges caused by the curse of dimensionality.

Method: The paper develops the THA algorithm, combining ensemble modeling and theoretical analyses of error bounds, to reduce complexity compared to existing Tensor Network methods.

Result: THA provides a scalable approach with observable finite-sample error bounds and demonstrates performance superior to simple model truncation, compensating for omitted dynamics in subset models.

Conclusion: The THA algorithm offers a theoretically grounded solution to previously intractable high-dimensional system identification problems, reducing complexity while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: The identification of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems via the Volterra series has significant potential, but has been severely hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.

### [485] [TriShGAN: Enhancing Sparsity and Robustness in Multivariate Time Series Counterfactuals Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06529)
*Hongnan Ma,Yiwei Shi,Guanxiong Sun,Mengyue Yang,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TriShGAN, a system for generating robust counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series by using triplet loss and a Shapelet Extractor to enhance sparsity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations are vital for understanding and altering AI decision-making, but generating them for multivariate time series is challenging due to their complexity and the limitations of existing methods.

Method: The proposed method, TriShGAN, extends the CounteRGAN framework with triplet loss for more robust counterfactual generation and incorporates a Shapelet Extractor to identify the most discriminative parts of data, improving sparsity and training efficiency.

Result: TriShGAN achieves more robust counterfactual explanations that balance proximity to queried instances and robustness against decision boundary shifts while enhancing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: TriShGAN advances counterfactual explanation generation for complex time series data by addressing issues such as robustness, sparsity, and computational challenges.

Abstract: In decision-making processes, stakeholders often rely on counterfactual explanations, which provide suggestions about what should be changed in the queried instance to alter the outcome of an AI system. However, generating these explanations for multivariate time series presents challenges due to their complex, multi-dimensional nature. Traditional Nearest Unlike Neighbor-based methods typically substitute subsequences in a queried time series with influential subsequences from an NUN, which is not always realistic in real-world scenarios due to the rigid direct substitution. Counterfactual with Residual Generative Adversarial Networks-based methods aim to address this by learning from the distribution of observed data to generate synthetic counterfactual explanations. However, these methods primarily focus on minimizing the cost from the queried time series to the counterfactual explanations and often neglect the importance of distancing the counterfactual explanation from the decision boundary. This oversight can result in explanations that no longer qualify as counterfactual if minor changes occur within the model. To generate a more robust counterfactual explanation, we introduce TriShGAN, under the CounteRGAN framework enhanced by the incorporation of triplet loss. This unsupervised learning approach uses distance metric learning to encourage the counterfactual explanations not only to remain close to the queried time series but also to capture the feature distribution of the instance with the desired outcome, thereby achieving a better balance between minimal cost and robustness. Additionally, we integrate a Shapelet Extractor that strategically selects the most discriminative parts of the high-dimensional queried time series to enhance the sparsity of counterfactual explanation and efficiency of the training process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an anchored-ensemble LSTM with a Student-t likelihood for accurate and trustworthy EV power estimation, delivering calibration, robustness, and efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve EV power estimation by achieving high point accuracy and reliable uncertainty management, vital for range prediction and energy management decisions.

Method: An anchored-ensemble LSTM with MAP training and Student-t likelihood is proposed, combining Gaussian weight priors for diversity and robust heavy-tailed prediction intervals.

Result: Achieved strong accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE 3.36, R-squared 0.93). Compared with baselines, it matched or improved log-scores and provided sharper uncertainty bands with nominal coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a compact, efficient solution coupling accuracy and uncertainty calibration, suitable for real-time EV energy management and range estimation.

Abstract: Accurate EV power estimation underpins range prediction and energy management, yet practitioners need both point accuracy and trustworthy uncertainty. We propose an anchored-ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Student-t likelihood that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency. The result is a compact, theoretically grounded estimator that couples accuracy, calibration, and systems efficiency, enabling reliable range estimation and decision-making for production EV energy management.

*Sara Khosravi,Burak Demirel,Linghui Zhou,Javier Rasines,Pablo Soldati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses hardware limitations in RANs by leveraging policy distillation for reinforcement learning, creating compact AI models that generalize well while conforming to legacy system constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAN baseband hardware, especially in 4G systems, struggles with deploying effective AI due to memory, computation, and real-time processing constraints, necessitating lightweight AI models at the cost of performance.

Method: The paper uses policy distillation in reinforcement learning to create lightweight AI models via single-policy and multi-policy distillation approaches, reducing size and inference time while maintaining generalization.

Result: Experiments in 5G-compliant simulators show that distilled models maintain generalization capabilities of teacher models while meeting hardware constraints.

Conclusion: Policy distillation is a viable strategy for deploying efficient AI models in RANs, balancing compactness and generalization performance under hardware limitations.

Abstract: Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) in radio access networks (RANs) presents several challenges, including limited availability of link-level measurements (e.g., CQI reports), stringent real-time processing constraints (e.g., sub-1 ms per TTI), and network heterogeneity (different spectrum bands, cell types, and vendor equipment). A critical yet often overlooked barrier lies in the computational and memory limitations of RAN baseband hardware, particularly in legacy 4th Generation (4G) systems, which typically lack on-chip neural accelerators. As a result, only lightweight AI models (under 1 Mb and sub-100~μs inference time) can be effectively deployed, limiting both their performance and applicability. However, achieving strong generalization across diverse network conditions often requires large-scale models with substantial resource demands. To address this trade-off, this paper investigates policy distillation in the context of a reinforcement learning-based link adaptation task. We explore two strategies: single-policy distillation, where a scenario-agnostic teacher model is compressed into one generalized student model; and multi-policy distillation, where multiple scenario-specific teachers are consolidated into a single generalist student. Experimental evaluations in a high-fidelity, 5th Generation (5G)-compliant simulator demonstrate that both strategies produce compact student models that preserve the teachers' generalization capabilities while complying with the computational and memory limitations of existing RAN hardware.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and simplify Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method via optimistic online-to-batch conversion for a better perspective on acceleration methods.

Method: The method involves incorporating optimism directly into online-to-batch conversions to achieve simplicity and maintain optimal convergence rates for both smooth and non-smooth convex optimization problems.

Result: The results demonstrate optimal accelerated convergence with optimistic online conversions for smooth, strongly convex, and non-smooth objectives. Effectiveness is evidenced by its correspondence with NAG.

Conclusion: Optimistic online-to-batch conversions offer a simplified and universal approach to achieving optimal convergence rates, aligning with classical NAG methods.

Abstract: In this work, we study offline convex optimization with smooth objectives, where the classical Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method achieves the optimal accelerated convergence. Extensive research has aimed to understand NAG from various perspectives, and a recent line of work approaches this from the viewpoint of online learning and online-to-batch conversion, emphasizing the role of optimistic online algorithms for acceleration. In this work, we contribute to this perspective by proposing novel optimistic online-to-batch conversions that incorporate optimism theoretically into the analysis, thereby significantly simplifying the online algorithm design while preserving the optimal convergence rates. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our conversions through the following results: (i) when combined with simple online gradient descent, our optimistic conversion achieves the optimal accelerated convergence; (ii) our conversion also applies to strongly convex objectives, and by leveraging both optimistic online-to-batch conversion and optimistic online algorithms, we achieve the optimal accelerated convergence rate for strongly convex and smooth objectives, for the first time through the lens of online-to-batch conversion; (iii) our optimistic conversion can achieve universality to smoothness -- applicable to both smooth and non-smooth objectives without requiring knowledge of the smoothness coefficient -- and remains efficient as non-universal methods by using only one gradient query in each iteration. Finally, we highlight the effectiveness of our optimistic online-to-batch conversions by a precise correspondence with NAG.

TL;DR: This paper investigates adaptive residual connections in graph neural networks, showing they prevent oversmoothing and improve performance, especially on heterophilic graphs, compared to standard approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preventing oversmoothing in graph neural networks while improving node embedding expressiveness through adaptive residual schemes.

Method: Developed and analyzed adaptive residual connections with varying residual strengths per node and proposed a heuristic variant for time efficiency.

Result: The proposed adaptive residual approach prevents oversmoothing, maintains Dirichlet energy, and outperforms existing methods in experiments, particularly on heterophilic graphs.

Conclusion: Adaptive residual connections improve graph neural network performance and theoretical guarantees, with a heuristic variant offering efficient and comparable results.

Abstract: Message passing is the core operation in graph neural networks, where each node updates its embeddings by aggregating information from its neighbors. However, in deep architectures, this process often leads to diminished expressiveness. A popular solution is to use residual connections, where the input from the current (or initial) layer is added to aggregated neighbor information to preserve embeddings across layers. Following a recent line of research, we investigate an adaptive residual scheme in which different nodes have varying residual strengths. We prove that this approach prevents oversmoothing; particularly, we show that the Dirichlet energy of the embeddings remains bounded away from zero. This is the first theoretical guarantee not only for the adaptive setting, but also for static residual connections (where residual strengths are shared across nodes) with activation functions. Furthermore, extensive experiments show that this adaptive approach outperforms standard and state-of-the-art message passing mechanisms, especially on heterophilic graphs. To improve the time complexity of our approach, we introduce a variant in which residual strengths are not learned but instead set heuristically, a choice that performs as well as the learnable version.

Method: A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model is developed with optimized hyperparameters using the LBFGS algorithm. LIME is used to interpret feature influence.

Result: The study demonstrates that probabilistic learning and explainable models can proactively identify lost-circulation risks, enhance LCM design, and reduce uncertainties.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers reliable predictions and interpretability, supporting risk mitigation and operational improvements in drilling contexts.

Abstract: Lost circulation remains a major and costly challenge in drilling operations, often resulting in wellbore instability, stuck pipe, and extended non-productive time. Accurate prediction of fluid loss is therefore essential for improving drilling safety and efficiency. This study presents a probabilistic machine learning framework based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting drilling fluid loss in complex formations. The GPR model captures nonlinear dependencies among drilling parameters while quantifying predictive uncertainty, offering enhanced reliability for high-risk decision-making. Model hyperparameters are optimized using the Limited memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm to ensure numerical stability and robust generalization. To improve interpretability, Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed to elucidate how individual features influence model predictions. The results highlight the potential of explainable probabilistic learning for proactive identification of lost-circulation risks, optimized design of lost circulation materials (LCM), and reduction of operational uncertainties in drilling applications.

Conclusion: Adaptive-depth GNNs provide a flexible and better alternative for handling both homophilic and heterophilic graph structures in node classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in addressing node classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of traditional GNNs degrades on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to different labels or properties. While recent work has introduced mechanisms to improve GNN performance under heterophily, certain key limitations still exist. Most existing models apply a fixed aggregation depth across all nodes, overlooking the fact that nodes may require different propagation depths based on their local homophily levels and neighborhood structures. Moreover, many methods are tailored to either homophilic or heterophilic settings, lacking the flexibility to generalize across both regimes. To address these challenges, we develop a theoretical framework that links local structural and label characteristics to information propagation dynamics at the node level. Our analysis shows that optimal aggregation depth varies across nodes and is critical for preserving class-discriminative information. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel adaptive-depth GNN architecture that dynamically selects node-specific aggregation depths using theoretically grounded metrics. Our method seamlessly adapts to both homophilic and heterophilic patterns within a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the performance of standard GNN backbones across diverse benchmarks.

*Xuyang Li,John Harlim,Romit Maulik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weak-Penalty Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (WP-NODE) for improving forecasting accuracy and robustness in chaotic dynamical systems affected by noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the difficulty of forecasting noisy, high-dimensional chaotic systems accurately, which often face performance degradation due to noise.

Method: The authors propose integrating a weak formulation as a penalty to complement the classical strong formulation-based learning within a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) architecture.

Result: Their method achieves superior forecasting accuracy and robustness in benchmark chaotic systems, setting a new standard for state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Combining weak and strong formulations via WP-NODE enhances the capability of data-driven models in noisy chaotic systems, providing accurate and robust solutions.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.

*Kaidong Wang,Jiale Li,Shao-Bo Lin,Yao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework creates synthetic data with asymmetric utility to protect firms’ competitive advantage while enabling strategic collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Firms face challenges with data sharing due to risks of losing competitive advantage despite the unlocked value. The paper seeks to address this dilemma.

Method: The method involves encapsulating predictive knowledge into a key model and generating synthetic data that overfits this model to guarantee asymmetric utility.

Result: EnFo achieves strong sample efficiency, robust privacy protection, and resistance to unauthorized use while matching original data performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively transforms non-rival data into a rival product, allowing firms to collaborate strategically without undermining their analytical edge.

Abstract: The non-rival nature of data creates a dilemma for firms: sharing data unlocks value but risks eroding competitive advantage. Existing data synthesis methods often exacerbate this problem by creating data with symmetric utility, allowing any party to extract its value. This paper introduces the Encapsulation-Forging (EnFo) framework, a novel approach to generate rival synthetic data with asymmetric utility. EnFo operates in two stages: it first encapsulates predictive knowledge from the original data into a designated ``key'' model, and then forges a synthetic dataset by optimizing the data to intentionally overfit this key model. This process transforms non-rival data into a rival product, ensuring its value is accessible only to the intended model, thereby preventing unauthorized use and preserving the data owner's competitive edge. Our framework demonstrates remarkable sample efficiency, matching the original data's performance with a fraction of its size, while providing robust privacy protection and resistance to misuse. EnFo offers a practical solution for firms to collaborate strategically without compromising their core analytical advantage.

### [494] [Dual-branch Spatial-Temporal Self-supervised Representation for Enhanced Road Network Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06633)
*Qinghong Guo,Yu Wang,Ji Cao,Tongya Zheng,Junshu Dai,Bingde Hu,Shunyu Liu,Canghong Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Spatial-Temporal representation framework, DST, leveraging graph convolution and causal Transformer for road network learning with dual self-supervised tasks, focusing on dynamic relations and traffic patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road network learning faces challenges due to spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, making it hard for traditional GNNs to generalize effectively for spatiotemporal tasks.

Method: DST employs mix-hop graph convolution for spatial modeling, hypergraph for long-range relations, and causal Transformer for temporal prediction with traffic differences as regularization.

Result: DST showcases superior performance over state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates robust zero-shot learning capabilities.

Conclusion: DST enhances road network representation by addressing spatial and temporal complexities, achieving better generalization and adaptability in spatiotemporal tasks.

Abstract: Road network representation learning (RNRL) has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and practitioners as various spatiotemporal tasks are emerging. Recent advanced methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to characterize the spatial structure of road segments in a self-supervised paradigm. However, spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of road networks raise severe challenges to the neighborhood smoothing mechanism of self-supervised GNNs. To address these issues, we propose a $\textbf{D}$ual-branch $\textbf{S}$patial-$\textbf{T}$emporal self-supervised representation framework for enhanced road representations, termed as DST. On one hand, DST designs a mix-hop transition matrix for graph convolution to incorporate dynamic relations of roads from trajectories. Besides, DST contrasts road representations of the vanilla road network against that of the hypergraph in a spatial self-supervised way. The hypergraph is newly built based on three types of hyperedges to capture long-range relations. On the other hand, DST performs next token prediction as the temporal self-supervised task on the sequences of traffic dynamics based on a causal Transformer, which is further regularized by differentiating traffic modes of weekdays from those of weekends. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods verify the superiority of our proposed framework. Moreover, the comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling facilitates DST to excel in zero-shot learning scenarios.

### [495] [CaberNet: Causal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain HVAC Energy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06634)
*Kaiyuan Zhai,Jiacheng Cui,Zhehao Zhang,Junyu Xue,Yang Deng,Kui Wu,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model, addresses challenges in cross-domain HVAC energy prediction by learning invariant representations, minimizing loss variance, and outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting labeled data for each building is impractical, yet existing methods struggle with variability across climate zones and rely heavily on expert input.

Method: CaberNet uses a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization global feature gate and domain-wise training to balance contributions, reduce loss variance, and ensure independence.

Result: Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that CaberNet reduces normalized mean squared error (NMSE) by 22.9% compared to the best alternatives.

Conclusion: CaberNet offers a robust framework for cross-domain HVAC energy prediction, easing scalability and reducing reliance on expert intervention or extensive labeled data.

Abstract: Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction. In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge, CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions, minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence. We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error (NMSE) compared to the best benchmark.

*Renato Castro,Rodrigo Paredes,Douglas Kahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines using machine learning for optimizing the allocation of beverage coolers in the FMCG industry, achieving effective predictions of client growth and improving ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors sought to address the unexplored area of using machine learning in asset allocation within the FMCG industry, particularly targeting commercial beverage cooler placement for revenue growth.

Method: The study applied machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) to predict client growth, analyzing sales volume changes before and after cooler allocation using a private dataset from 3,119 B2B clients.

Result: The models achieved strong predictive performance, with AUC scores reaching up to 0.898. Simulations revealed improved ROI by better client selection and cost savings compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Machine learning methods can significantly improve asset allocation strategies in the FMCG industry by optimizing operational decisions and maximizing returns through informed cooler placement.

Abstract: In the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry, deciding where to place physical assets, such as commercial beverage coolers, can directly impact revenue growth and execution efficiency. Although churn prediction and demand forecasting have been widely studied in B2B contexts, the use of machine learning to guide asset allocation remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a framework focused on predicting which beverage clients are most likely to deliver strong returns in volume after receiving a cooler. Using a private dataset from a well-known Central American brewing and beverage company of 3,119 B2B traditional trade channel clients that received a cooler from 2022-01 to 2024-07, and tracking 12 months of sales transactions before and after cooler installation, three growth thresholds were defined: 10%, 30% and 50% growth in sales volume year over year. The analysis compares results of machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost combined with SHAP for interpretable feature analysis in order to have insights into improving business operations related to cooler allocation; the results show that the best model has AUC scores of 0.857, 0.877, and 0.898 across the thresholds on the validation set. Simulations suggest that this approach can improve ROI because it better selects potential clients to grow at the expected level and increases cost savings by not assigning clients that will not grow, compared to traditional volume-based approaches with substantial business management recommendations

### [497] [Dual-Pathway Fusion of EHRs and Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Unseen Drug-Drug Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06662)
*Franklin Lee,Tengfei Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced system combining knowledge graphs and electronic health records for better drug-drug interaction (DDI) detection, aiming for zero-shot inference and improved precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address preventable harm caused by drug-drug interactions, overcoming limitations of pharmacologic knowledge graphs and electronic health records in identifying unseen or rarely used drugs.

Method: The system employs a fusion 'Teacher' model to learn context from EHRs and KGs, distilling knowledge into a 'Student' model. Using a shared ontology for scoring drug relations, it achieves zero-shot inference without KG access at inference.

Result: The system improves detection of clinically significant DDIs, reduces false alerts, and achieves consistent predictions across institutions. It also identifies mechanisms for unseen drugs, supporting real-world clinical decision-making.

Conclusion: This system offers a robust, interpretable methodology for drug interaction prediction, enhancing clinical support and pharmacovigilance by addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion "Teacher" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled "Student" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance.

### [498] [An Adaptive Machine Learning Triage Framework for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06681)
*Richard Hou,Shengpu Tang,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning framework to predict Alzheimer’s disease progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) while reducing reliance on expensive diagnostic tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an effective, cost-efficient method to predict Alzheimer’s disease progression in MCI patients by minimizing the need for costly tests such as PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis.

Method: The authors developed a two-stage machine learning framework that uses cognitive tests and clinical data to predict the necessity of acquiring advanced, costly features based on their projected value of information.

Result: The framework achieved an AUROC of 0.929, comparable to models that used both basic and advanced features, while reducing the demand for advanced tests by 20%.

Conclusion: This framework represents a promising, interpretable, and economically viable step toward improving early Alzheimer’s disease diagnostics. Future work should explore additional advanced features and larger validations.

Abstract: Accurate predictions of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) can enable effective personalized therapy. While cognitive tests and clinical data are routinely collected, they lack the predictive power of PET scans and CSF biomarker analysis, which are prohibitively expensive to obtain for every patient. To address this cost-accuracy dilemma, we design a two-stage machine learning framework that selectively obtains advanced, costly features based on their predicted "value of information". We apply our framework to predict AD progression for MCI patients using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework reduces the need for advanced testing by 20% while achieving a test AUROC of 0.929, comparable to the model that uses both basic and advanced features (AUROC=0.915, p=0.1010). We also provide an example interpretability analysis showing how one may explain the triage decision. Our work presents an interpretable, data-driven framework that optimizes AD diagnostic pathways and balances accuracy with cost, representing a step towards making early, reliable AD prediction more accessible in real-world practice. Future work should consider multiple categories of advanced features and larger-scale validation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a gradient-based algorithm that reformulates multi-modal learning as a multi-objective optimization problem, improving performance on benchmarks and reducing computational costs by up to 20x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal learning methods underperform due to imbalanced learning across modalities and require computationally intensive solutions.

Method: The authors reformulate multi-modal learning as a multi-objective optimization problem and design a gradient-based algorithm with convergence guarantees.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves performance on benchmarks compared to balanced MML and MOO baselines, while drastically reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Reformulating MML as an MOO problem with a new gradient-based method addresses imbalanced learning issues efficiently and delivers superior results.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning (MML) aims to integrate information from multiple modalities, which is expected to lead to superior performance over single-modality learning. However, recent studies have shown that MML can underperform, even compared to single-modality approaches, due to imbalanced learning across modalities. Methods have been proposed to alleviate this imbalance issue using different heuristics, which often lead to computationally intensive subroutines. In this paper, we reformulate the MML problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that overcomes the imbalanced learning issue among modalities and propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the modified MML problem. We provide convergence guarantees for the proposed method, and empirical evaluations on popular MML benchmarks showcasing the improved performance of the proposed method over existing balanced MML and MOO baselines, with up to ~20x reduction in subroutine computation time.

*Tao Li,Kaiyuan Hou,Tuan Vinh,Carl Yang,Monika Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces CLaP, a framework that improves molecular property prediction by separating causal signals from spurious context using a layerwise approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the interpretability issues and reliance on spurious context in deep models for molecular property prediction, which impact reliability and predictive performance under distribution shifts.

Method: CLaP employs layerwise splitting to separate causal and non-causal signals, integrates multiple graph representations, removes context irrelevant to labels, and utilizes causal saliency maps for interpretable molecular design.

Result: CLaP enhances predictive performance (MAE, MSE, $R^2$) on molecular benchmarks, produces accurate atom-level causal saliency maps for substructures associated with predictions.

Conclusion: By separating causal signals at every layer, CLaP offers a reliable framework for accurate and interpretable molecular property prediction, aiding informed molecular edits and design.

Abstract: Deep models are used for molecular property prediction, yet they are often difficult to interpret and may rely on spurious context rather than causal structure, which reduces reliability under distribution shift and harms predictive performance. We introduce CLaP (Causal Layerwise Peeling), a framework that separates causal signal from context in a layerwise manner and integrates diverse graph representations of molecules. At each layer, a causal block performs a soft split into causal and non-causal branches, fuses causal evidence across modalities, and progressively removes batch-coupled context to focus on label-relevant structure, thereby limiting shortcut signals and stabilizing layerwise refinement. Across four molecular benchmarks, CLaP consistently improves MAE, MSE, and $R^2$ over competitive baselines. The model also produces atom-level causal saliency maps that highlight substructures responsible for predictions, providing actionable guidance for targeted molecular edits. Case studies confirm the accuracy of these maps and their alignment with chemical intuition. By peeling context from cause at every layer, the model yields predictors that are both accurate and interpretable for molecular design.

Motivation: To quantify the environmental impact of machine learning inference, especially on low-resource hardware, which is poorly understood.

Method: Developed ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs during inference, with adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.

Result: Evaluated 1,900 inference configurations across models, tasks, hardware, and precisions; demonstrated quantization's benefits, inefficiency of large accelerators for lightweight tasks, and costly suboptimal implementations.

Conclusion: ML-EcoLyzer provides a benchmark for sustainability-focused model selection and rigorous evaluation of inference environmental costs.

Abstract: Machine learning inference occurs at a massive scale, yet its environmental impact remains poorly quantified, especially on low-resource hardware. We present ML-EcoLyzer, a cross-framework tool for measuring the carbon, energy, thermal, and water costs of inference across CPUs, consumer GPUs, and datacenter accelerators. The tool supports both classical and modern models, applying adaptive monitoring and hardware-aware evaluation.
  We introduce the Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS), which quantifies the number of effective parameters served per gram of CO$_2$ emitted. Our evaluation covers over 1,900 inference configurations, spanning diverse model architectures, task modalities (text, vision, audio, tabular), hardware types, and precision levels. These rigorous and reliable measurements demonstrate that quantization enhances ESS, huge accelerators can be inefficient for lightweight applications, and even small models may incur significant costs when implemented suboptimally. ML-EcoLyzer sets a standard for sustainability-conscious model selection and offers an extensive empirical evaluation of environmental costs during inference.

*Dian Jin,Yancheng Yuan,Xiaoming Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMEA introduces a new fine-tuning method that enhances pretrained equivariant graph neural networks efficiently with scalar gating, achieving state-of-the-art predictions while preserving symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT techniques often disrupt symmetry in pretrained equivariant GNNs, limiting adaptation to different tasks. A novel approach is needed to ensure symmetry while optimizing performance.

Method: MMEA utilizes scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes at tensor orders and multiplicities, ensuring strict equivariance and efficient adaptation.

Result: MMEA consistently improves energy and force predictions across benchmarks, better than existing methods, while requiring fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MMEA proves modulating feature magnitudes can adapt equivariant models effectively without breaking symmetry, introducing a promising direction for PEFT in such architectures.

Abstract: Pretrained equivariant graph neural networks based on spherical harmonics offer efficient and accurate alternatives to computationally expensive ab-initio methods, yet adapting them to new tasks and chemical environments still requires fine-tuning. Conventional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapters and LoRA, typically break symmetry, making them incompatible with those equivariant architectures. ELoRA, recently proposed, is the first equivariant PEFT method. It achieves improved parameter efficiency and performance on many benchmarks. However, the relatively high degrees of freedom it retains within each tensor order can still perturb pretrained feature distributions and ultimately degrade performance. To address this, we present Magnitude-Modulated Equivariant Adapter (MMEA), a novel equivariant fine-tuning method which employs lightweight scalar gating to modulate feature magnitudes on a per-order and per-multiplicity basis. We demonstrate that MMEA preserves strict equivariance and, across multiple benchmarks, consistently improves energy and force predictions to state-of-the-art levels while training fewer parameters than competing approaches. These results suggest that, in many practical scenarios, modulating channel magnitudes is sufficient to adapt equivariant models to new chemical environments without breaking symmetry, pointing toward a new paradigm for equivariant PEFT design.

*Xin Qiu,Junlong Tong,Yirong Sun,Yunpu Ma,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a scaling paradox in time series forecasting models where larger models do not necessarily perform better and introduces a method to tackle this by retaining only functionally important layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand and address the observed scaling paradox in time series forecasting models, where increasing model size and data volume fails to improve performance.

Method: The authors identify a phenomenon called few-layer dominance, where only a small subset of layers are impactful. They propose a method to automatically retain these dominant layers to enhance model efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Retaining 21% of parameters results in up to 12% improvement in accuracy and 2.7× faster inference. The method achieves comparable or better accuracy in 95% of cases across various models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that scaling models indiscriminately is ineffective for time series forecasting. Selective retention of dominant layers yields better accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale models are at the forefront of time series (TS) forecasting, dominated by two paradigms: fine-tuning text-based Large Language Models (LLM4TS) and training Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) from scratch. Both approaches share a foundational assumption that scaling up model capacity and data volume leads to improved performance. However, we observe a \textit{\textbf{scaling paradox}} in TS models, revealing a puzzling phenomenon that larger models do \emph{NOT} achieve better performance. Through extensive experiments on two model families across four scales (100M to 1.7B parameters) and diverse data (up to 6B observations), we rigorously confirm that the scaling paradox is a pervasive issue. We then diagnose its root cause by analyzing internal representations, identifying a phenomenon we call \textit{few-layer dominance}: only a small subset of layers are functionally important, while the majority are redundant, under-utilized, and can even distract training. Based on this discovery, we propose a practical method to automatically identify and retain only these dominant layers. In our models, retaining only 21\% of the parameters achieves up to a 12\% accuracy improvement and a 2.7$\times$ inference speedup. We validate the universality of our method on 8 prominent SOTA models (LLM4TS and TSFMs, 90M to 6B), showing that retaining less than 30\% of layers achieves comparable or superior accuracy in over 95\% of tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCARE, a transformer-based sensor calibration model that addresses eight microscopic requirements for deployment, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many on-device sensor calibration models focus only on macroscopic requirements such as accuracy, real-time performance, and resource efficiency, leaving deployment issues like instantaneous error and worst-case latency unaddressed.

Method: The authors propose SCARE, a transformer model with key innovations: Sequence Lens Projector for compressing time-series data, Efficient Bitwise Attention module for binary hash-based efficiency, and a hash optimization strategy for stable training.

Result: SCARE achieves high computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy, demonstrated through experiments on large air-quality datasets and microcontroller deployments, surpassing existing models by fulfilling eight deployment requirements.

Conclusion: SCARE is the first sensor calibration model to simultaneously satisfy eight microscopic deployment requirements, providing better calibration performance in microcontroller environments.

Abstract: Most on-device sensor calibration studies benchmark models only against three macroscopic requirements (i.e., accuracy, real-time, and resource efficiency), thereby hiding deployment bottlenecks such as instantaneous error and worst-case latency. We therefore decompose this triad into eight microscopic requirements and introduce Scare (Sensor Calibration model balancing Accuracy, Real-time, and Efficiency), an ultra-compressed transformer that fulfills them all. SCARE comprises three core components: (1) Sequence Lens Projector (SLP) that logarithmically compresses time-series data while preserving boundary information across bins, (2) Efficient Bitwise Attention (EBA) module that replaces costly multiplications with bitwise operations via binary hash codes, and (3) Hash optimization strategy that ensures stable training without auxiliary loss terms. Together, these components minimize computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy and compatibility with microcontroller units (MCUs). Extensive experiments on large-scale air-quality datasets and real microcontroller deployments demonstrate that Scare outperforms existing linear, hybrid, and deep-learning baselines, making Scare, to the best of our knowledge, the first model to meet all eight microscopic requirements simultaneously.

Result: Stepwise evaluation showed better performance with a 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC compared to holistic scoring for detecting errors.

Conclusion: Step-by-step scoring enhances self-evaluating capabilities for multi-step reasoning, increasing reliability and trustworthiness in failure detection frameworks.

Abstract: Reliability and failure detection of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment in high-stakes, multi-step reasoning tasks. Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, improving their trustworthiness and providing a practical framework for failure detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of integrating diverse multi-modal information while preventing catastrophic forgetting in multi-modal continual learning.

Method: A pre-trained model-based framework with a cross-modality adapter (using a mixture-of-experts structure) and representation alignment loss for robust knowledge retention and integration.

Result: Experimental results on multiple multi-modal datasets show improved performance over baselines, achieving higher accuracy and reduced forgetting.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances multi-modal continual learning by addressing challenges of multi-modality integration and knowledge preservation.

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for adapting models to new tasks while retaining previously acquired knowledge. While existing approaches predominantly focus on uni-modal data, multi-modal learning offers substantial benefits by utilizing diverse sensory inputs, akin to human perception. However, multi-modal continual learning presents additional challenges, as the model must effectively integrate new information from various modalities while preventing catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose a pre-trained model-based framework for multi-modal continual learning. Our framework includes a novel cross-modality adapter with a mixture-of-experts structure to facilitate effective integration of multi-modal information across tasks. We also introduce a representation alignment loss that fosters learning of robust multi-modal representations, and regularize relationships between learned representations to preserve knowledge from previous tasks. Experiments on several multi-modal datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both class-incremental and domain-incremental learning, achieving higher accuracy and reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: The paper illustrates how minimal parameter changes in reasoning models significantly enhance language model performance, emphasizing interpretable mechanisms via efficient methods like LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind the enhanced performance of reasoning models and how minimal parameter changes influence logical task capabilities.

Method: Utilized rank-1 LoRA adapter on a large language model to recover reasoning performance with interpretable activations and trained sparse autoencoder for feature analysis.

Result: Achieved 73-90% reasoning benchmark performance compared to full parameter finetune and identified interpretable, reasoning-specific activations and features.

Conclusion: Reasoning performance largely arises from minimal, interpretable changes to base model parameters, and parameter-efficient training methods are effective tools for insights into model behavior.

Abstract: Reasoning models leverage inference-time compute to significantly enhance the performance of language models on difficult logical tasks, and have become a dominating paradigm in frontier LLMs. Despite their wide adoption, the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced performance of these reasoning models are not well understood. In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct which recovers 73-90% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings highlight that reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters, and explore what these changes affect. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics.

*Xin He,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of over-smoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks by proposing a novel Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), integrating both local and global perspectives using Mamba modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenge of over-smoothing in GNNs, where node representations become indistinguishable after repeated message passing, and existing solutions fail to sufficiently address the progressive and global aspects of the issue.

Method: DMbaGCN introduces two modules: Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for node-specific representation dynamics and Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) for global context integration, leveraging Mamba's selective state modeling and global attention features.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate DMbaGCN's effectiveness and efficiency in enhancing node discriminability and mitigating over-smoothing in deep GNNs.

Conclusion: DMbaGCN offers a promising approach to improve deep GNNs by addressing over-smoothing through a combination of local evolution and global context integration, enhancing model performance and node representation clarity.

Abstract: Over-smoothing remains a fundamental challenge in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where repeated message passing causes node representations to become indistinguishable. While existing solutions, such as residual connections and skip layers, alleviate this issue to some extent, they fail to explicitly model how node representations evolve in a node-specific and progressive manner across layers. Moreover, these methods do not take global information into account, which is also crucial for mitigating the over-smoothing problem. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a Dual Mamba-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (DMbaGCN), which is a novel framework that integrates Mamba into GNNs to address over-smoothing from both local and global perspectives. DMbaGCN consists of two modules: the Local State-Evolution Mamba (LSEMba) for local neighborhood aggregation and utilizing Mamba's selective state space modeling to capture node-specific representation dynamics across layers, and the Global Context-Aware Mamba (GCAMba) that leverages Mamba's global attention capabilities to incorporate global context for each node. By combining these components, DMbaGCN enhances node discriminability in deep GNNs, thereby mitigating over-smoothing. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

*Dongcheng Li,Junhan Chen,Aoxiang Zhou,Chunpei Li,Youquan Xian,Peng Liu,Xianxian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models face challenges due to the depletion of public data, and this paper proposes a novel federated learning-based framework, IFed-ICL, to efficiently utilize private organizational data for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations seek ways to enhance large language model performance by using private data without incurring extensive computational costs or data transmission.

Method: The paper introduces IFed-ICL, a framework inspired by federated learning, that converts local client context examples into implicit vector representations for inference, reducing computational and transmission overhead.

Result: Experiments show IFed-ICL achieves high performance across text classification tasks while minimizing parameter updates, local computation, and data transmission compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: IFed-ICL improves efficiency and accuracy in leveraging private-domain data for task-specific enhancements in large language models, offering a scalable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop and expand, the extensive public data they rely on faces the risk of depletion. Consequently, leveraging private data within organizations to enhance the performance of large models has emerged as a key challenge. The federated learning paradigm, combined with model fine-tuning techniques, effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters. However,the necessity to process high-dimensional feature spaces results in substantial overall computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose the Implicit Federated In-Context Learning (IFed-ICL) framework. IFed-ICL draws inspiration from federated learning to establish a novel distributed collaborative paradigm, by converting client local context examples into implicit vector representations, it enables distributed collaborative computation during the inference phase and injects model residual streams to enhance model performance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding performance across multiple text classification tasks. Compared to traditional methods, IFed-ICL avoids the extensive parameter updates required by conventional fine-tuning methods while reducing data transmission and local computation at the client level in federated learning. This enables efficient distributed context learning using local private-domain data, significantly improving model performance on specific tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonlinear operations in Transformer models cause latency issues, posing challenges for efficient hardware acceleration.

Method: QUARK uses quantization and a novel circuit-sharing design to target nonlinear operations for efficient FPGA acceleration.

Result: QUARK achieves up to 1.96 times speedup over GPUs, lowers hardware overhead by over 50%, and reduces accuracy loss in ultra-low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: QUARK offers a significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy, enhancing the computational feasibility of Transformer models.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have revolutionized computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmarks. However, nonlinear operations in models significantly contribute to inference latency, presenting unique challenges for efficient hardware acceleration. To this end, we propose QUARK, a quantization-enabled FPGA acceleration framework that leverages common patterns in nonlinear operations to enable efficient circuit sharing, thereby reducing hardware resource requirements. QUARK targets all nonlinear operations within Transformer-based models, achieving high-performance approximation through a novel circuit-sharing design tailored to accelerate these operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that QUARK significantly reduces the computational overhead of nonlinear operators in mainstream Transformer architectures, achieving up to a 1.96 times end-to-end speedup over GPU implementations. Moreover, QUARK lowers the hardware overhead of nonlinear modules by more than 50% compared to prior approaches, all while maintaining high model accuracy -- and even substantially boosting accuracy under ultra-low-bit quantization.

### [512] [Data Trajectory Alignment for LLM Domain Adaptation: A Two-Phase Synthesis Framework for Telecommunications Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06776)
*Zhicheng Zhou,Jing Li,Suming Qiu,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a framework to improve adaptation of large language models in low-resource domains like telecommunication. DTA prioritizes solution processes over final answers and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models face challenges in adapting to domains with scarce and low-quality data, especially under resource-constrained conditions like mobile/edge settings.

Method: DTA follows a two-phase model-agnostic framework: Phase I generates diverse, high-quality candidate solutions using strong teachers; Phase II refines solutions by aligning intermediate steps with student biases, selecting exemplars through signal-aware checks, and optimizing reasoning scaffolding.

Result: DTA achieves 72.45% accuracy on TELEMATH, outperforming strong baselines and distillation methods. It significantly reduces energy consumption per token by ~42% and latency by ~60% under edge-like settings.

Conclusion: DTA offers an efficient and accurate method for adapting language models in low-resource environments. It emphasizes solution process alignment, providing a practical approach for domains beyond telecommunications.

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in verticals such as telecommunications, where adaptation is hindered by scarce, low-information-density corpora and tight mobile/edge constraints. We propose Data Trajectory Alignment (DTA), a two-phase, model-agnostic data curation framework that treats solution processes - not only final answers - as first-class supervision. Phase I (Initializing) synthesizes diverse, high-coverage candidates using an ensemble of strong teachers. Phase II (DTA) rewrites teacher solutions to align intermediate steps and presentation style with the target student's inductive biases and then performs signal-aware exemplar selection via agreement checks and reflection-based judging. Instantiated on telecommunications mathematics (e.g., link budgets, SNR/AMC selection, and power-control feasibility), DTA yields state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on TELEMATH without enabling explicit "thinking" modes: 72.45% pass@1, surpassing distilled-only training by +17.65 points and outperforming a strong baseline (Qwen3-32B with thinking enabled) by +2.94 points. Token-shift analyses indicate that DTA concentrates gains on logical-structural discourse markers rather than merely amplifying domain nouns, indicating improved reasoning scaffolding. Under edge-like inference settings, DTA improves efficiency by reducing reliance on multi-sample voting and disabling expensive reasoning heuristics, cutting energy per output token by ~42% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode enabled) and end-to-end latency by ~60% versus Qwen3-32B (thinking mode disabled). These results demonstrate that aligning how solutions are produced enables compact, high-yield supervision that is effective for both accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical recipe for domain adaptation in low-resource verticals beyond telecom.

*Tung-Long Vuong,Julien Monteil,Hien Dang,Volodymyr Vaskovych,Trung Le,Vu Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores collaboration in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for recommendation systems, proposing an anchor regularizer to improve global consistency and user identity preservation while validating methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve VAE-based collaborative filtering by addressing the underexplored theoretical aspects of user collaboration, focusing on latent proximity and mechanisms for global signal sharing between users.

Method: Authors analyze latent proximity-driven collaboration in VAEs using derived latent sharing radius and propose an anchor regularizer for aligning user posteriors with item embeddings. They compare mechanisms like $β$-KL regularization and input masking for encouraging global mixing.

Result: They validate their theoretical insights and proposed methods using datasets (Netflix, MovieLens-20M, Million Song) and successfully deploy the algorithm in a real-world Amazon streaming platform experiment.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed anchor regularizer improves global mixing, stabilizes user representation under masking, and enhances collaborative filtering performance, with successful practical deployment in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits \emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1) $β$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck, promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large; (2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions, which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix, MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful online experiment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASS, a resource-efficient sleep staging framework using EEG signals, leveraging masking and prompt learning strategies to maintain reliable classification under limited data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in using traditional methods for sleep staging, which depend on long and continuous EEG recordings unsuitable for resource-constrained systems like wearable or home-based monitors.

Method: Proposes a multi-level masking strategy for feature modeling with partial data and a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism to compensate for lost contextual information, enhancing classification performance.

Result: MASS achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy across four datasets, particularly effective in scenarios with limited data.

Conclusion: MASS demonstrates potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring systems.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging plays a vital role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.

### [515] [Rethinking Parameter Sharing as Graph Coloring for Structured Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06786)
*Boyang Zhang,Daning Cheng,Yunquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Geo-Sharing", a scalable approach to parameter sharing using group-theoretic concepts and a geometric criterion for effective model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models have large parameter sizes, causing high memory usage and limiting practical deployment. Parameter sharing can reduce redundancy, but existing approaches are limited and lack systemic analysis for cross-layer sharing.

Method: The authors approach parameter sharing using structural symmetries in the parameter space and propose a geometric criterion based on second-order Taylor expansion and Hessian spectrum to determine sharing configurations.

Result: Geo-Sharing achieves higher compression ratios with less accuracy degradation compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods across multiple architectures and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed group-theoretic and geometric approach for parameter sharing is scalable and effective, providing a principled methodology for structured compression in deep models.

Abstract: Modern deep models have massive parameter sizes, leading to high inference-time memory usage that limits practical deployment. Parameter sharing, a form of structured compression, effectively reduces redundancy, but existing approaches remain heuristic-restricted to adjacent layers and lacking a systematic analysis for cross-layer sharing. However, extending sharing across multiple layers leads to an exponentially expanding configuration space, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible and forming a critical bottleneck for parameter sharing. We recast parameter sharing from a group-theoretic perspective as introducing structural symmetries in the model's parameter space. A sharing configuration can be described by a coloring function $α:L\rightarrow C$ (L: layer indices and C: sharing classes), which determines inter-layer sharing groups while preserving structural symmetry. To determine the coloring function, we propose a second-order geometric criterion based on Taylor expansion and the Hessian spectrum. By projecting perturbations onto the Hessian's low-curvature eigensubspace, the criterion provides an analytic rule for selecting sharing groups that minimize performance impact, yielding a principled and scalable configuration procedure. Across diverse architectures and tasks, Geo-Sharing consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic sharing strategies, achieving higher compression ratios with smaller accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an integrated modeling framework to address trade-offs in energy system transitions by combining agent-based modeling with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address overlooked interactions in energy transition assessments, such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts.

Method: The paper introduces a framework combining agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate energy transitions and their environmental, resource, and social impacts.

Result: Application to Southern California illustrates scenario-driven constraints, spatial trade-offs, and the benefits of multiscale decision-making.

Conclusion: The framework enhances adaptive and resilient energy transition planning, providing insights on spatial and institutional scales.

Abstract: Transitioning to sustainable and resilient energy systems requires navigating complex and interdependent trade-offs across environmental, social, and resource dimensions. Neglecting these trade-offs can lead to unintended consequences across sectors. However, existing assessments often evaluate emerging energy pathways and their impacts in silos, overlooking critical interactions such as regional resource competition and cumulative impacts. We present an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based modeling and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to simulate how energy transition pathways interact with regional resource competition, ecological constraints, and community-level burdens. We apply the model to a case study in Southern California. The results demonstrate how integrated and multiscale decision making can shape energy pathway deployment and reveal spatially explicit trade-offs under scenario-driven constraints. This modeling framework can further support more adaptive and resilient energy transition planning on spatial and institutional scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research addresses privacy, toxicity, and intellectual property concerns in multimodal large language models by proposing an advanced machine unlearning method called MIP-Editor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address privacy leakage, toxicity, and intellectual property violations in MLLMs by designing methods to selectively forget information without compromising the overall model utility.

Method: MIP-Editor utilizes modality-specific attribution scores and influential neuron path identification for unlearning. It applies representation misdirection to enable forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's reasoning capabilities.

Result: The proposed method achieves up to 87.75% forgetting in multimodal tasks and shows a 54.26% improvement in retaining general knowledge. It also achieves 80.65% forgetting in textual tasks while preserving 77.9% of general functionality.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduces a novel MU approach for MLLMs that balances selective forgetting with maintaining general utility, providing a crucial tool for ensuring model safety and compliance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend foundation models to real-world applications by integrating inputs such as text and vision. However, their broad knowledge capacity raises growing concerns about privacy leakage, toxicity mitigation, and intellectual property violations. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a practical solution by selectively forgetting targeted knowledge while preserving overall model utility. When applied to MLLMs, existing neuron-editing-based MU approaches face two fundamental challenges: (1) forgetting becomes inconsistent across modalities because existing point-wise attribution methods fail to capture the structured, layer-by-layer information flow that connects different modalities; and (2) general knowledge performance declines when sensitive neurons that also support important reasoning paths are pruned, as this disrupts the model's ability to generalize. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a multimodal influential neuron path editor (MIP-Editor) for MU. Our approach introduces modality-specific attribution scores to identify influential neuron paths responsible for encoding forget-set knowledge and applies influential-path-aware neuron-editing via representation misdirection. This strategy also enables effective and coordinated forgetting across modalities while preserving the model's general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that MIP-Editor achieves a superior unlearning performance on multimodal tasks, with a maximum forgetting rate of 87.75% and up to 54.26% improvement in general knowledge retention. On textual tasks, MIP-Editor achieves up to 80.65% forgetting and preserves 77.9% of general performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/PreckLi/MIP-Editor.

TL;DR: FedNET is a privacy-preserving framework that uses federated learning for proactive identification of high-risk communication network links with accurate traffic forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of potential bottlenecks or high-risk links in communication networks without compromising sensitive network data.

Method: FedNET employs Federated Learning to perform node-level traffic forecasting and aggregates predictions to estimate link-level utilization for ranking high-risk links.

Result: Federated traffic prediction shows comparable accuracy to centralized methods. Predictions are highly accurate for shorter time horizons ($R^2 >0.92$) and reasonably accurate for longer horizons ($R^2 ≈ 0.45–0.55$). It enables identification of high-risk links up to three days in advance.

Conclusion: FedNET demonstrates practical application in traffic engineering and capacity planning by providing anticipatory predictions with strong accuracy and preserving privacy.

Abstract: We propose FedNET, a proactive and privacy-preserving framework for early identification of high-risk links in large-scale communication networks, that leverages a distributed multi-step traffic forecasting method. FedNET employs Federated Learning (FL) to model the temporal evolution of node-level traffic in a distributed manner, enabling accurate multi-step-ahead predictions (e.g., several hours to days) without exposing sensitive network data. Using these node-level forecasts and known routing information, FedNET estimates the future link-level utilization by aggregating traffic contributions across all source-destination pairs. The links are then ranked according to the predicted load intensity and temporal variability, providing an early warning signal for potential high-risk links. We compare the federated traffic prediction of FedNET against a centralized multi-step learning baseline and then systematically analyze the impact of history and prediction window sizes on forecast accuracy using the $R^2$ score. Results indicate that FL achieves accuracy close to centralized training, with shorter prediction horizons consistently yielding the highest accuracy ($R^2 >0.92$), while longer horizons providing meaningful forecasts ($R^2 \approx 0.45\text{--}0.55$). We further validate the efficacy of the FedNET framework in predicting network utilization on a realistic network topology and demonstrate that it consistently identifies high-risk links well in advance (i.e., three days ahead) of the critical stress states emerging, making it a practical tool for anticipatory traffic engineering and capacity planning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid method combining neural operators and Newton-based correction for faster and more accurate nonlinear simulations in solid mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Newton-Raphson solvers in nonlinear problems are robust but computationally demanding, while neural operators are fast but lack accuracy outside their training scope.

Method: The method involves training a physics-informed neural field for initial predictions, followed by a Newton-based correction to refine the solution.

Result: The proposed hybrid approach achieves both computational efficiency and accuracy, surpassing standard strategies.

Conclusion: This hybrid NiN strategy has the potential to accelerate and improve large-scale nonlinear problem-solving in computational solid mechanics.

Abstract: We propose a Newton-based scheme, initialized by neural operator predictions, to accelerate the parametric solution of nonlinear problems in computational solid mechanics. First, a physics informed conditional neural field is trained to approximate the nonlinear parametric solutionof the governing equations. This establishes a continuous mapping between the parameter and solution spaces, which can then be evaluated for a given parameter at any spatial resolution. Second, since the neural approximation may not be exact, it is subsequently refined using a Newton-based correction initialized by the neural output. To evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, we compare three solution strategies: (i) the standard Newton-Raphson solver used in NFEM, which is robust and accurate but computationally demanding; (ii) physics-informed neural operators, which provide rapid inference but may lose accuracy outside the training distribution and resolution; and (iii) the neural-initialized Newton (NiN) strategy, which combines the efficiency of neural operators with the robustness of NFEM. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach reduces computational cost while preserving accuracy, highlighting its potential to accelerate large-scale nonlinear simulations.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) typically relies on modeling environment dynamics for data efficiency.

To address this, we propose CtrlFlow, a trajectory-level synthetic method using conditional flow matching (CFM), which directly modeling the distribution of trajectories from initial states to high-return terminal states without explicitly modeling the environment transition function. Our method ensures optimal trajectory sampling by minimizing the control energy governed by the non-linear Controllability Gramian Matrix, while the generated diverse trajectory data significantly enhances the robustness and cross-task generalization of policy learning. In online settings, CtrlFlow demonstrates the better performance on common MuJoCo benchmark tasks than dynamics models and achieves superior sample efficiency compared to standard MBRL methods.

However, modern semiconductor technologies with densely packed structures present significant challenges in unbiasedly sampling transition domains in walk steps with multiple high-contrast dielectric materials. We present DeepRWCap, a machine learning-guided random walk solver that predicts the transition quantities required to guide each step of the walk. These include Poisson kernels, gradient kernels, signs and magnitudes of weights. DeepRWCap employs a two-stage neural architecture that decomposes structured outputs into face-wise distributions and spatial kernels on cube faces. It uses 3D convolutional networks to capture volumetric dielectric interactions and 2D depthwise separable convolutions to model localized kernel behavior. The design incorporates grid-based positional encodings and structural design choices informed by cube symmetries to reduce learning redundancy and improve generalization. Trained on 100,000 procedurally generated dielectric configurations, DeepRWCap achieves a mean relative error of $1.24\pm0.53$\% when benchmarked against the commercial Raphael solver on the self-capacitance estimation of 10 industrial designs spanning 12 to 55 nm nodes. Compared to the state-of-the-art stochastic difference method Microwalk, DeepRWCap achieves an average 23\% speedup. On complex designs with runtimes over 10 s, it reaches an average 49\% acceleration.

Motivation: Traditional evolutionary algorithms struggle with premature convergence and imbalanced exploration-exploitation search strategies.

Method: Socio-cognitive mutation operators were applied to imitate high-performing solutions and avoid poor ones, inspired by the TOPSIS method.

Abstract: This paper presents the application of socio-cognitive mutation operators inspired by the TOPSIS method to the Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence (LABS) problem. Traditional evolutionary algorithms, while effective, often suffer from premature convergence and poor exploration-exploitation balance. To address these challenges, we introduce socio-cognitive mutation mechanisms that integrate strategies of following the best solutions and avoiding the worst. By guiding search agents to imitate high-performing solutions and avoid poor ones, these operators enhance both solution diversity and convergence efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TOPSIS-inspired mutation outperforms the base algorithm in optimizing LABS sequences. The study highlights the potential of socio-cognitive learning principles in evolutionary computation and suggests directions for further refinement.

*Ji Cheng,Bo Xue,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPSL-MOBO, combining a hypernetwork and Bayesian optimization for efficiently solving parametric multi-objective optimization problems while adapting across parameter changes without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for parametric multi-objective optimization are computationally expensive as they require full re-execution for each new parameter configuration.

Method: The authors propose PPSL-MOBO, utilizing a hypernetwork with LoRA for parametric adaptability and Gaussian process surrogates with hypervolume-based acquisition for efficient optimization.

Result: PPSL-MOBO successfully demonstrates its ability on modular-constrained multi-objective optimization and dynamic optimization problems, generalizing across the parameter space.

Conclusion: PPSL-MOBO presents a unified model capable of handling infinite families of PMO problems, enabling instant inference and reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Parametric multi-objective optimization (PMO) addresses the challenge of solving an infinite family of multi-objective optimization problems, where optimal solutions must adapt to varying parameters. Traditional methods require re-execution for each parameter configuration, leading to prohibitive costs when objective evaluations are computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose Parametric Pareto Set Learning with multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (PPSL-MOBO), a novel framework that learns a unified mapping from both preferences and parameters to Pareto-optimal solutions. PPSL-MOBO leverages a hypernetwork with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently capture parametric variations, while integrating Gaussian process surrogates and hypervolume-based acquisition to minimize expensive function evaluations. We demonstrate PPSL-MOBO's effectiveness on two challenging applications: multi-objective optimization with shared components, where certain design variables must be identical across solution families due to modular constraints, and dynamic multi-objective optimization, where objectives evolve over time. Unlike existing methods that cannot directly solve PMO problems in a unified manner, PPSL-MOBO learns a single model that generalizes across the entire parameter space. By enabling instant inference of Pareto sets for new parameter values without retraining, PPSL-MOBO provides an efficient solution for expensive PMO problems.

### [524] [Uncertainty-Aware Dual-Ranking Strategy for Offline Data-Driven Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06459)
*Huanbo Lyu,Daniel Herring,Shiqiao Zhou,Miqing Li,Zheming Zuo,Jelena Ninic,James Andrews,Fabian Spill,Shuo Wang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dual-ranking strategy to improve offline multi-objective optimization when data is limited and surrogate models exhibit high uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of data in offline MOPs causes high epistemic uncertainty in surrogate models, leading to suboptimal optimization outcomes with traditional methods like Kriging.

Method: A dual-ranking strategy is proposed, combining non-dominated sorting (from NSGA-II) with an uncertainty-based rank derived from surrogate models such as Quantile Regression, Monte Carlo Dropout, and Bayesian Neural Networks.

Result: The dual-ranking strategy shows significant performance improvement in offline MOPs compared to state-of-the-art surrogate methods, based on tests on benchmark and real-world problems.

Conclusion: This framework elevates uncertainty-aware optimization in constrained data scenarios, offering a practical solution for real-world multi-objective problems.

Abstract: Offline data-driven Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOPs) rely on limited data from simulations, experiments, or sensors. This scarcity leads to high epistemic uncertainty in surrogate predictions. Conventional surrogate methods such as Kriging assume Gaussian distributions, which can yield suboptimal results when the assumptions fail. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet novel dual-ranking strategy, working with a basic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, where the built-in non-dominated sorting is kept and the second rank is devised for uncertainty estimation. In the latter, we utilize the uncertainty estimates given by several surrogate models, including Quantile Regression (QR), Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Concretely, with this dual-ranking strategy, each solution's final rank is the average of its non-dominated sorting rank and a rank derived from the uncertainty-adjusted fitness function, thus reducing the risk of misguided optimization under data constraints. We evaluate our approach on benchmark and real-world MOPs, comparing it to state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our dual-ranking strategy significantly improves the performance of NSGA-II in offline settings, achieving competitive outcomes compared with traditional surrogate-based methods. This framework advances uncertainty-aware multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, offering a robust solution for data-limited, real-world applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons to improve spiking neural networks (SNNs) for continuous regression tasks, offering smoother and more accurate results than conventional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons in SNNs for tackling continuous regression tasks and scientific machine learning.

Method: The authors utilized QIF neurons due to their smooth, differentiable spiking behavior, enabling integration into gradient-based training pipelines for models like MLPs, DeepONets, and PINNs, and systematically evaluated their performance.

Result: QIF-based networks demonstrated improved smoothness, accuracy, and stability in function approximation, operator learning, and PDE solving compared to LIF-based counterparts.

Conclusion: QIF neurons enhance spiking neural networks by bridging the gap to continuous-valued deep learning, advancing applications in physics-informed and operator-learning frameworks.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired computation but remain underexplored for continuous regression tasks in scientific machine learning. In this work, we introduce and systematically evaluate Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons as an alternative to the conventional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model in both directly trained SNNs and ANN-to-SNN conversion frameworks. The QIF neuron exhibits smooth and differentiable spiking dynamics, enabling gradient-based training and stable optimization within architectures such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Across benchmarks on function approximation, operator learning, and partial differential equation (PDE) solving, QIF-based networks yield smoother, more accurate, and more stable predictions than their LIF counterparts, which suffer from discontinuous time-step responses and jagged activation surfaces. These results position the QIF neuron as a computational bridge between spiking and continuous-valued deep learning, advancing the integration of neuroscience-inspired dynamics into physics-informed and operator-learning frameworks.

### [526] [Towards a Rigorous Understanding of the Population Dynamics of the NSGA-III: Tight Runtime Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07125)
*Andre Opris*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the runtime dynamics of NSGA-III, an evolutionary algorithm for multi-objective optimization, especially on the bi-objective OneMinMax problem. It provides tight runtime bounds and shows that NSGA-III can outperform NSGA-II under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in the theoretical understanding of NSGA-III, particularly its runtime dynamics and population management during multi-objective optimization.

Method: The authors analyzed the runtime dynamics of NSGA-III on benchmark problems, deriving both upper and lower runtime bounds for the algorithm under specific conditions and population sizes.

Result: The paper proves tight runtime bounds for NSGA-III on the bi-objective OneMinMax problem, showing its efficiency and better performance compared to NSGA-II in some cases.

Conclusion: This study advances the theoretical understanding of NSGA-III, demonstrating its strengths in handling multi-objective problems and establishing a theoretical foundation for its runtime efficiency.

Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms are widely used for solving multi-objective optimization problems. A prominent example is NSGA-III, which is particularly well suited for solving problems involving more than three objectives, distinguishing it from the classical NSGA-II. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of NSGA III remains very limited, especially with respect to runtime analysis. A central open problem concerns its population dynamics, which involve controlling the maximum number of individuals sharing the same fitness value during the exploration process. In this paper, we make a significant step towards such an understanding by proving tight runtime bounds for NSGA-III on the bi-objective OneMinMax ($2$-OMM) problem. Firstly, we prove that NSGA-III requires $Ω(n^2 \log(n) / μ)$ generations in expectation to optimize $2$-OMM assuming the population size $μ$ satisfies $n+1 \leq μ=O(\log(n)^c(n+1))$ where $n$ denotes the problem size and $c<1$ is a constant. Apart from~\cite{opris2025multimodal}, this is the first proven lower runtime bound for NSGA-III on a classical benchmark problem. Complementing this, we secondly improve the best known upper bound of NSGA-III on the $m$-objective OneMinMax problem ($m$-OMM) of $O(n \log(n))$ generations by a factor of $μ/(2n/m + 1)^{m/2}$ for a constant number $m$ of objectives and population size $(2n/m + 1)^{m/2} \leq μ\in O(\sqrt{\log(n)} (2n/m + 1)^{m/2})$. This yields tight runtime bounds in the case $m = 2$, and the surprising result that NSGA-III beats NSGA-II by a factor of $μ/n$ in the expected runtime.

*Benjamin Doerr,Martin S. Krejca,Milan Stanković*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The study provides new runtime guarantees for the SPEA2 algorithm on certain benchmarks, showing it performs efficiently with lesser dependency on population size compared to NSGA-II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding and runtime performance of the SPEA2 algorithm, highlighting how it differs from NSGA-II and its parameter sensitivity.

Method: The study examines the selection mechanism of SPEA2 and analyzes its population dynamics to derive theoretical runtime guarantees for specific benchmark problems.

Result: For benchmarks like OneJumpZeroJump, SPEA2 demonstrates runtime guarantees less dependent on its population size. Specifically, it achieves efficient computation of Pareto fronts with suitable parameters even beyond typical population scaling.

Conclusion: SPEA2's runtime guarantee is shown to be very favorable, making parameter selection easier and more flexible compared to NSGA-II, thereby improving usability and performance in solving multi-objective optimization problems.

Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II, the SPEA2 is one of the most widely used domination-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. For both algorithms, the known runtime guarantees are linear in the population size; for the NSGA-II, matching lower bounds exist. With a careful study of the more complex selection mechanism of the SPEA2, we show that it has very different population dynamics. From these, we prove runtime guarantees for the OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks that depend less on the population size. For example, we show that the SPEA2 with parent population size $μ\ge n - 2k + 3$ and offspring population size $λ$ computes the Pareto front of the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark with gap size $k$ in an expected number of $O( (λ+μ)n + n^{k+1})$ function evaluations. This shows that the best runtime guarantee of $O(n^{k+1})$ is not only achieved for $μ= Θ(n)$ and $λ= O(n)$ but for arbitrary $μ, λ= O(n^k)$. Thus, choosing suitable parameters -- a key challenge in using heuristic algorithms -- is much easier for the SPEA2 than the NSGA-II.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on automating code optimization techniques to enhance performance using data-driven methods to analyze interactions and sequences of transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for computational performance highlights the importance of automatic code optimization. The study seeks to understand the behavior of optimization transformations and their order of application for efficiency.

Method: The authors created a dataset of random programs, applied random optimization sequences, and studied execution times using statistical analysis.

Result: The data analysis revealed patterns and insights into the design of effective automatic code optimization strategies.

Conclusion: Predefined orders of transformations may streamline optimization algorithms without significantly reducing performance potential.

Abstract: As the demand for computational power grows, optimizing code through compilers becomes increasingly crucial. In this context, we focus on fully automatic code optimization techniques that automate the process of selecting and applying code transformations for better performance without manual intervention. Understanding how these transformations behave and interact is key to designing more effective optimization strategies. Compiler developers must make numerous design choices when constructing these heuristics. For instance, they may decide whether to allow transformations to be explored in any arbitrary order or to enforce a fixed sequence. While the former may theoretically offer the best performance gains, it significantly increases the search space. This raises an important question: Can a predefined, fixed order of applying transformations speed up the search without severely compromising optimization potential? In this paper, we address this and other related questions that arise in the design of automatic code optimization algorithms. Using a data-driven approach, we generate a large dataset of random programs, apply random optimization sequences, and record their execution times. Through statistical analysis, we provide insights that guide the development of more efficient automatic code optimization algorithms.

*Avani Tiwari,Yacine Hakimi,Riyadh Baghdadi*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an approximate and novel DL-based legality prediction model for code transformations, demonstrating effectiveness with reduced resource usage and comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in compilers by developing a feasible approximate method for legality checks during code transformation.

Method: A deep learning model predicts transformation legality using code representation and transformation lists. It replaces the legality check during RL agent training.

Result: The DL model achieved an F1 score of 0.91 for predicting legality. It reduced resource usage by 80% CPU and 35% RAM with comparable RL agent performance.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively enables faster RL training for code optimization while maintaining satisfactory accuracy and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Compilers must check the legality of code transformations to guarantee the correctness of applying a sequence of code transformations to a given code. While such a legality check needs to be precisely computed in general, we can use an approximate legality prediction model in certain cases, such as training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent for schedule prediction. In this paper, we propose an approximate method for legality checks. We propose a novel DL model for predicting the legality of transformations. The model takes the code representation and a list of transformations as input and predicts whether applying those transformations to the code is legal. We implement and evaluate the proposed model, demonstrating its effectiveness. Our evaluation shows an F1 score of 0.91 on a test set of randomly generated programs. To further evaluate the model in a practical scenario, we used the model to replace the legality check used during the training of an RL agent designed for automatic code optimization. We demonstrate that such a replacement enables the agent to train on twice as many steps, resulting in faster training and reducing resource usage by approximately 80\% for CPU and 35\% for RAM. The agent trained using this approach maintains comparable performance, with only a 4\% reduction on benchmarks from the Polybench suite compared to the traditional method.

TL;DR: The paper presents 'TumorMap,' a surgical robotic system that uses multifunctional lasers and deep learning to autonomously resect tumors with submillimeter accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately identifying and removing tumors during surgery while preserving healthy tissue due to limitations like lack of high-fidelity tumor modeling, tissue complexities, and human physical constraints.

Method: Designing the TumorMap platform incorporating three lasers (optical coherence tomography, laser-induced fluorescence, and cutting laser scalpel) and deep learning, enabling fully automated, noncontact intraoperative 3D tumor mapping and resection.

Result: TumorMap was successfully validated in murine osteosarcoma and soft-tissue sarcoma models, providing submillimeter resection accuracy through multimodal sensor guidance.

Conclusion: TumorMap demonstrates the capability for autonomous, precise tumor surgery without human involvement, representing a significant advancement in surgical robotics.

Abstract: Surgical resection of malignant solid tumors is critically dependent on the surgeon's ability to accurately identify pathological tissue and remove the tumor while preserving surrounding healthy structures. However, building an intraoperative 3D tumor model for subsequent removal faces major challenges due to the lack of high-fidelity tumor reconstruction, difficulties in developing generalized tissue models to handle the inherent complexities of tumor diagnosis, and the natural physical limitations of bimanual operation, physiologic tremor, and fatigue creep during surgery. To overcome these challenges, we introduce "TumorMap", a surgical robotic platform to formulate intraoperative 3D tumor boundaries and achieve autonomous tissue resection using a set of multifunctional lasers. TumorMap integrates a three-laser mechanism (optical coherence tomography, laser-induced endogenous fluorescence, and cutting laser scalpel) combined with deep learning models to achieve fully-automated and noncontact tumor resection. We validated TumorMap in murine osteoscarcoma and soft-tissue sarcoma tumor models, and established a novel histopathological workflow to estimate sensor performance. With submillimeter laser resection accuracy, we demonstrated multimodal sensor-guided autonomous tumor surgery without any human intervention.

Motivation: To unify the stochastic behavior principles governing biological and physical systems, and extend these principles to robotic swarm design.

Method: Empirical analysis of ant behavior (Formica polyctena) and robotic swarm testing based on energy constraint maximization.

Result: Ant and robotic swarms exhibit statistical behaviors akin to physical systems, enabling decentralized cooperation.

Conclusion: A unified framework for biological, physical, and robotic swarms is proposed, offering insights for scalable swarm robotics design.

Abstract: Biological swarms, such as ant colonies, achieve collective goals through decentralized and stochastic individual behaviors. Similarly, physical systems composed of gases, liquids, and solids exhibit random particle motion governed by entropy maximization, yet do not achieve collective objectives. Despite this analogy, no unified framework exists to explain the stochastic behavior in both biological and physical systems. Here, we present empirical evidence from \textit{Formica polyctena} ants that reveals a shared statistical mechanism underlying both systems: maximization under different energy function constraints. We further demonstrate that robotic swarms governed by this principle can exhibit scalable, decentralized cooperation, mimicking physical phase-like behaviors with minimal individual computation. These findings established a unified stochastic model linking biological, physical, and robotic swarms, offering a scalable principle for designing robust and intelligent swarm robotics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of current robotic grasp methods, which require large-scale expert annotations and retraining for new objects, by utilizing vision-language models for a zero-shot grasping technique.

Method: The method includes using a vision-language model to generate a goal image representing a grasp, predicting depth and segmentation to transform the image into 3D, and aligning object point clouds using PCA and optimization to calculate the grasp pose.

Result: VLAD-Grasp achieves results competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art supervised models on standard datasets while also demonstrating zero-shot adaptability to new real-world objects.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of vision-language models as strong priors for robotic grasping and manipulation, achieving effective outcomes without requiring training or labeled datasets.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation; however, most existing methods rely on large-scale expert annotations and necessitate retraining to handle new objects. We present VLAD-Grasp, a Vision-Language model Assisted zero-shot approach for Detecting grasps. From a single RGB-D image, our method (1) prompts a large vision-language model to generate a goal image where a straight rod "impales" the object, representing an antipodal grasp, (2) predicts depth and segmentation to lift this generated image into 3D, and (3) aligns generated and observed object point clouds via principal component analysis and correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. Unlike prior work, our approach is training-free and does not rely on curated grasp datasets. Despite this, VLAD-Grasp achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to that of state-of-the-art supervised models on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot, highlighting vision-language foundation models as powerful priors for robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: This research introduces a two-player game approach to improve multi-finger robot hands' grasping capabilities, demonstrating significant performance gains in both simulated and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-finger robot hands have the potential to revolutionize interaction with objects but struggle with reliable grasping, often due to instability or failure to constrain object motion effectively.

Method: The proposed method formulates the grasping challenge as a two-player game where the robot synthesizes feasible grasp configurations and the object adversarially seeks motion to escape, improving robustness to disturbances.

Result: Simulation results show a grasp success rate of 75.78%, outperforming baseline methods by up to 19.61%. Real-world experiments achieved success rates of 85.0% on ShadowHand and 87.5% on LeapHand, confirming the method's practicality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Leveraging adversarial object motion during grasp synthesis significantly enhances the grasping reliability of robot hands, enabling practical real-world deployment and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: For many complex tasks, multi-finger robot hands are poised to revolutionize how we interact with the world, but reliably grasping objects remains a significant challenge. We focus on the problem of synthesizing grasps for multi-finger robot hands that, given a target object's geometry and pose, computes a hand configuration. Existing approaches often struggle to produce reliable grasps that sufficiently constrain object motion, leading to instability under disturbances and failed grasps. A key reason is that during grasp generation, they typically focus on resisting a single wrench, while ignoring the object's potential for adversarial movements, such as escaping. We propose a new grasp-synthesis approach that explicitly captures and leverages the adversarial object motion in grasp generation by formulating the problem as a two-player game. One player controls the robot to generate feasible grasp configurations, while the other adversarially controls the object to seek motions that attempt to escape from the grasp. Simulation experiments on various robot platforms and target objects show that our approach achieves a success rate of 75.78%, up to 19.61% higher than the state-of-the-art baseline. The two-player game mechanism improves the grasping success rate by 27.40% over the method without the game formulation.

*Taku Okawara,Ryo Nishibe,Mao Kasano,Kentaro Uno,Kazuya Yoshida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a system using monocular cameras to enable real-time metrically scaled 3D terrain mapping for limbed climbing robots in space exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limbed climbing robots need energy-efficient sensors for challenging terrain mapping, especially for space missions where resources are limited.

Method: A SLAM method is introduced that integrates monocular visual data with limb kinematics to estimate gripper poses and 3D map scales using factor graph optimization.

Result: Simulations and experiments prove the framework’s success in creating scaled 3D maps and autonomous terrain grasping with monocular cameras, reducing RGB-D dependency.

Conclusion: The system supports energy-efficient and scalable perception for climbing robots on extraterrestrial terrains, enhancing feasibility for future space missions.

Abstract: Limbed climbing robots are designed to explore challenging vertical walls, such as the skylights of the Moon and Mars. In such robots, the primary role of a hand-eye camera is to accurately estimate 3D positions of graspable points (i.e., convex terrain surfaces) thanks to its close-up views. While conventional climbing robots often employ RGB-D cameras as hand-eye cameras to facilitate straightforward 3D terrain mapping and graspable point detection, RGB-D cameras are large and consume considerable power.
  This work presents a 3D terrain mapping system designed for space exploration using limbed climbing robots equipped with a monocular hand-eye camera. Compared to RGB-D cameras, monocular cameras are more lightweight, compact structures, and have lower power consumption. Although monocular SLAM can be used to construct 3D maps, it suffers from scale ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a SLAM method that fuses monocular visual constraints with limb forward kinematics. The proposed method jointly estimates time-series gripper poses and the global metric scale of the 3D map based on factor graph optimization.
  We validate the proposed framework through both physics-based simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework constructs a metrically scaled 3D terrain map in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces using a monocular hand-eye camera, without relying on RGB-D cameras. Our method contributes to scalable and energy-efficient perception for future space missions involving limbed climbing robots. See the video summary here: https://youtu.be/fMBrrVNKJfc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that combines semantic decomposition, reinforcement learning, visual language models, and knowledge distillation to automate complex, contact-rich tasks efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the cost and scalability limitations of real-world data and human engineering for long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Method: The framework decomposes tasks into small skills with RL-trained policies, uses visual language models for task planning, and trains a unified policy via Visual-Tactile Diffusion Policy.

Result: The approach successfully learns policies for complex tasks through simulation-only data while achieving scalable generalization without the need for human demonstrations.

Conclusion: The proposed method reduces reliance on costly real-world data and achieves scalable automation in complex manipulation tasks using advanced integration of RL, VLMs, and imitation learning techniques.

Abstract: Autonomous execution of long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks traditionally requires extensive real-world data and expert engineering, posing significant cost and scalability challenges. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating hierarchical semantic decomposition, reinforcement learning (RL), visual language models (VLMs), and knowledge distillation to overcome these limitations. Complex tasks are decomposed into atomic skills, with RL-trained policies for each primitive exclusively in simulation. Crucially, our RL formulation incorporates explicit force constraints to prevent object damage during delicate interactions. VLMs perform high-level task decomposition and skill planning, generating diverse expert demonstrations. These are distilled into a unified policy via Visual-Tactile Diffusion Policy for end-to-end execution. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies exploring different VLM-based task planners to identify optimal demonstration generation pipelines, and systematically compare imitation learning algorithms for skill distillation. Extensive simulation experiments and physical deployment validate that our approach achieves policy learning for long-horizon manipulation without costly human demonstrations, while the VLM-guided atomic skill framework enables scalable generalization to diverse tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing handheld devices that struggle with tactile sensing and pose tracking in complex interaction scenarios.

Method: The approach involves designing a compliant visuo-tactile sensor, DuoTact, reconstructing sensor deformation as 3D point clouds, and implementing a 6-DoF pose acquisition using Meta Quest controllers.

Result: ViTaMIn-B demonstrates higher efficiency, usability, and superior performance in bimanual manipulation tasks compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively improves tactile sensing, pose tracking, and task performance in contact-rich bimanual scenarios.

Abstract: Handheld devices have opened up unprecedented opportunities to collect large-scale, high-quality demonstrations efficiently. However, existing systems often lack robust tactile sensing or reliable pose tracking to handle complex interaction scenarios, especially for bimanual and contact-rich tasks. In this work, we propose ViTaMIn-B, a more capable and efficient handheld data collection system for such tasks. We first design DuoTact, a novel compliant visuo-tactile sensor built with a flexible frame to withstand large contact forces during manipulation while capturing high-resolution contact geometry. To enhance the cross-sensor generalizability, we propose reconstructing the sensor's global deformation as a 3D point cloud and using it as the policy input. We further develop a robust, unified 6-DoF bimanual pose acquisition process using Meta Quest controllers, which eliminates the trajectory drift issue in common SLAM-based methods. Comprehensive user studies confirm the efficiency and high usability of ViTaMIn-B among novice and expert operators. Furthermore, experiments on four bimanual manipulation tasks demonstrate its superior task performance relative to existing systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fairness-aware hierarchical control framework for automated vehicle coordination at intersections, ensuring safety, real-time feasibility, and equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure fairness in automated vehicle coordination at intersections for equitable access, social acceptance, and long-term system efficiency.

Method: A hierarchical control framework is proposed: a centralized module allocates authority based on fairness principles, and vehicles utilize precomputed trajectories with safety filters.

Result: The method achieves near-perfect fairness, eliminates collisions, reduces delays, and supports real-time traffic control under varying conditions.

Conclusion: Fairness can be systematically integrated into autonomous traffic systems without compromising safety or overall performance.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in the coordination of connected and automated vehicles at intersections is essential for equitable access, social acceptance, and long-term system efficiency, yet it remains underexplored in safety-critical, real-time traffic control. This paper proposes a fairness-aware hierarchical control framework that explicitly integrates inequity aversion into intersection management. At the top layer, a centralized allocation module assigns control authority (i.e., selects a single vehicle to execute its trajectory) by maximizing a utility that accounts for waiting time, urgency, control history, and velocity deviation. At the bottom layer, the authorized vehicle executes a precomputed trajectory using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and applies a high-order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF)-based safety filter for real-time collision avoidance. Simulation results across varying traffic demands and demand distributions demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-perfect fairness, eliminates collisions, reduces average delay, and maintains real-time feasibility. These results highlight that fairness can be systematically incorporated without sacrificing safety or performance, enabling scalable and equitable coordination for future autonomous traffic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular framework enabling robots to interpret and enforce diverse safety specifications based on natural language instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve robot interaction in human-centered environments by enabling interpretation of natural language safety instructions, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Method: The framework uses an LLM to translate instructions to safety specifications, a perception module for object-level 3D environmental grounding, and a MPC-based safety filter for enforcing constraints.

Result: Simulation and hardware experiments show the framework robustly interprets and applies diverse safety constraints across various environments.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework successfully bridges language and safety specifications for trustworthy robot navigation in complex settings.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into open-world, human-centered environments, their ability to interpret natural language instructions and adhere to safety constraints is critical for effective and trustworthy interaction. Existing approaches often focus on mapping language to reward functions instead of safety specifications or address only narrow constraint classes (e.g., obstacle avoidance), limiting their robustness and applicability. We propose a modular framework for language-conditioned safety in robot navigation. Our framework is composed of three core components: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based module that translates free-form instructions into structured safety specifications, (2) a perception module that grounds these specifications by maintaining object-level 3D representations of the environment, and (3) a model predictive control (MPC)-based safety filter that enforces both semantic and geometric constraints in real time. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through both simulation studies and hardware experiments, demonstrating that it robustly interprets and enforces diverse language-specified constraints across a wide range of environments and scenarios.

Conclusion: This research establishes a manufacturable soft sleeve actuation framework for enhanced wearable assistive devices, emphasizing compact design and improved performance.

Abstract: Aging populations and the rising prevalence of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders increase the demand for wearable mobility assistive devices that are effective, comfortable, and anatomically compatible. Many existing systems use rigid mechanisms and bulky interfaces that impede force transmission and reduce wearability. This study introduces a soft sleeve actuation architecture that conforms to the limb while transmitting forces and moments efficiently. We develop three soft sleeve actuators that produce linear, bending, and twisting motion, and an omnidirectional design that combines these motions in one device. Actuators are fabricated from thermoplastic elastomers using a customized fused filament fabrication process that produces airtight and compliant structures and resolves leakage observed with conventional methods. A dedicated experimental platform quantifies kinematic outputs such as displacement, angle, and twist, and kinetic outputs such as force and torque under low pneumatic pressures. A parametric study varies geometric features and material properties to determine their influence on performance. Results show reproducible multi axis motion with improved transfer of force to the limb and reduced need for complex attachment hardware. The work establishes a unified and manufacturable framework for soft sleeve actuation that enables compact and user centered assistive technologies with enhanced kinematic and kinetic performance.

Motivation: To overcome challenges in data scarcity and complex trajectory planning for UAV navigation in outdoor aerial environments.

Method: The framework employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune vision-language models efficiently and introduces a long-horizon planner for precise UAV trajectory synthesis.

Result: Experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark show notable performance improvements (up to 4.34% Success Rate, 6.19% Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% Path Length Success) over baseline methods.

Conclusion: OpenVLN framework demonstrates efficacy in long-horizon trajectory planning for UAV navigation in challenging aerial environments.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely-applied in ground-based vision-language navigation (VLN). However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings. Our method demonstrates consistent performance gains of up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in Success weighted by Path Length over baseline methods, validating its deployment efficacy for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptation to new environments is challenging for pre-trained Vision-Language-Action models like OpenVLA, especially when consistency in performance is crucial in real-world tasks.

Method: The method involves experience replay and retrieval with compact feature representation storage and a Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss function. It relies on cosine similarity to retrieve relevant past experiences and prioritizes successful trajectories in replay.

Result: ExpReS-VLA shows significant improvement on the LIBERO simulation benchmark and physical robot tasks, with better success rates and faster adaptation compared to naive fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ExpReS-VLA achieves impressive task-specific adaptation for robotic manipulation tasks while maintaining efficiency, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models such as OpenVLA show impressive zero-shot generalization across robotic manipulation tasks but often fail to adapt efficiently to new deployment environments. In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in OVMM rely on proximity-based navigation, often leading to manipulation failures due to lack of consideration for affordances.

Method: The proposed zero-shot framework combines vision-language models for semantic understanding with geometric optimization to construct cross-modal representations and guide placement through task-relevant affordances.

Result: Testing across five different OVMM tasks reveals a significant improvement, with the system achieving an 85% task success rate compared to classical approaches.

Conclusion: Affordance-aware, multimodal reasoning offers a promising solution for generalizable mobile manipulation planning driven by task-specific instructions.

Abstract: In open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM), task success often hinges on the selection of an appropriate base placement for the robot. Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. Evaluated on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves an 85% success rate, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods. This demonstrates the promise of affordance-aware and multimodal reasoning for generalizable, instruction-conditioned planning in OVMM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional collision detection methods are non-differentiable, limiting their use in gradient-based optimization tasks. Previous efforts to introduce differentiability were restricted to convex objects, lacking robustness for complex geometries.

Method: The paper introduces a robust framework using distance-based randomized smoothing, adaptive sampling, and equivalent gradient transport for collision detection. It effectively computes gradients for both convex and concave objects across diverse settings.

Result: Experiments using complex meshes from DexGraspNet and Objaverse show significant performance improvements over existing baselines, demonstrating the framework's efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables robust and differentiable collision detection applicable to various geometries and scales, directly benefiting tasks like dexterous grasp synthesis. Code is open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Collision detection is a core component of robotics applications such as simulation, control, and planning. Traditional algorithms like GJK+EPA compute witness points (i.e., the closest or deepest-penetration pairs between two objects) but are inherently non-differentiable, preventing gradient flow and limiting gradient-based optimization in contact-rich tasks such as grasping and manipulation. Recent work introduced efficient first-order randomized smoothing to make witness points differentiable; however, their direction-based formulation is restricted to convex objects and lacks robustness for complex geometries. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient differentiable collision detection framework that supports both convex and concave objects across diverse scales and configurations. Our method introduces distance-based first-order randomized smoothing, adaptive sampling, and equivalent gradient transport for robust and informative gradient computation. Experiments on complex meshes from DexGraspNet and Objaverse show significant improvements over existing baselines. Finally, we demonstrate a direct application of our method for dexterous grasp synthesis to refine the grasp quality. The code is available at https://github.com/JYChen18/DiffCollision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using an external photoreflective sensor to enable tactile sensing in soft robots without embedding sensors in the contact surface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots require tactile sensing for safe human-robot interactions and practical applications, but traditional methods compromise structural softness or increase complexity.

Method: The approach utilizes a silicone skin with external photoreflective sensing to estimate surface deformation and force during contact interactions.

Result: Experiments show consistent force response, low hysteresis, high repeatability, and successful integration with a soft robotic gripper to detect grasp events.

Conclusion: The method provides durable, flexible, and simple tactile sensing for soft robots, enabling broader applications and improved collaboration with humans.

Abstract: We present a tactile sensing method enabled by the mechanical compliance of soft robots; an externally attachable photoreflective module reads surface deformation of silicone skin to estimate contact force without embedding tactile transducers. Locating the sensor off the contact interface reduces damage risk, preserves softness, and simplifies fabrication and maintenance. We first characterize the optical sensing element and the compliant skin, thendetermine the design of a prototype tactile sensor. Compression experiments validate the approach, exhibiting a monotonic force output relationship consistent with theory, low hysteresis, high repeatability over repeated cycles, and small response indentation speeds. We further demonstrate integration on a soft robotic gripper, where the module reliably detects grasp events. Compared with liquid filled or wireembedded tactile skins, the proposed modular add on architecture enhances durability, reduces wiring complexity, and supports straightforward deployment across diverse robot geometries. Because the sensing principle reads skin strain patterns, it also suggests extensions to other somatosensory cues such as joint angle or actuator state estimation from surface deformation. Overall, leveraging surface compliance with an external optical module provides a practical and robust route to equip soft robots with force perception while preserving structural flexibility and manufacturability, paving the way for robotic applications and safe human robot collaboration.

Motivation: Current methods for humanoid robot locomotion require separate controllers for each skill, limiting generalization and adaptability in diverse environments.

Method: AHC uses a two-stage framework: multi-behavior distillation to generate a basic controller, followed by reinforced fine-tuning using feedback to improve terrain adaptability.

Result: Experiments in simulation and on Unitree G1 robots demonstrate effective adaptability of AHC across behaviors, terrains, and situations.

Conclusion: AHC enables humanoid robots to exhibit versatile locomotion behaviors and adapt to diverse terrains, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are promising to learn a diverse set of human-like locomotion behaviors, including standing up, walking, running, and jumping. However, existing methods predominantly require training independent policies for each skill, yielding behavior-specific controllers that exhibit limited generalization and brittle performance when deployed on irregular terrains and in diverse situations. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Humanoid Control (AHC) that adopts a two-stage framework to learn an adaptive humanoid locomotion controller across different skills and terrains. Specifically, we first train several primary locomotion policies and perform a multi-behavior distillation process to obtain a basic multi-behavior controller, facilitating adaptive behavior switching based on the environment. Then, we perform reinforced fine-tuning by collecting online feedback in performing adaptive behaviors on more diverse terrains, enhancing terrain adaptability for the controller. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world experiments in Unitree G1 robots. The results show that our method exhibits strong adaptability across various situations and terrains.

Motivation: Robots often face challenges in perceiving and interacting with unknown objects that have articulated components, requiring advancements to overcome limitations caused by unknown geometry and kinematics.

Method: ArtReg applies a pose tracking approach integrating visuo-tactile point clouds into an unscented Kalman Filter in the SE(3) Lie Group, enabling joint detection and closed-loop manipulation via purposeful maneuvers.

Result: ArtReg demonstrated improved pose accuracy in experiments with various unseen objects under challenging conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The developed method enables robust and accurate robotic interactions with complex articulated objects, showcasing advancements in perception and manipulation using visuo-tactile information.

Abstract: Robots operating in real-world environments frequently encounter unknown objects with complex structures and articulated components, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, and tools. The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints).

### [553] [From Demonstrations to Safe Deployment: Path-Consistent Safety Filtering for Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06385)
*Ralf Römer,Julian Balletshofer,Jakob Thumm,Marco Pavone,Angela P. Schoellig,Matthias Althoff*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces PACS, a safety mechanism for diffusion policies (DPs), ensuring path-consistent braking while preserving task success without compromising its learned behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies excel in complex tasks but lack inherent safety mechanisms. Existing safety solutions disrupt the policy’s learned behavior, leading to degraded performance and unpredictability, which creates the need for a method that ensures safety without compromising task success.

Method: The authors propose PACS, a path-consistent safety filtering mechanism that modifies trajectories through path-consistent braking. They utilize set-based reachability analysis to verify safety in real-time and adapt to uncertainties.

Result: PACS provides formal safety assurances in dynamic environments, preserves task success rates, and outperforms reactive safety methods like control barrier functions by up to 68% in task success.

Conclusion: PACS effectively ensures safety without degrading task performance, making it a robust solution for deploying DPs in real-world dynamic environments.

Abstract: Diffusion policies (DPs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex manipulation tasks by learning from large-scale demonstration datasets, often spanning multiple embodiments and environments. However, they cannot guarantee safe behavior, so external safety mechanisms are needed. These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

TL;DR: This paper presents a solution for enhancing the motion potential and terrain adaptability of a novel wheeled bipedal robot by developing a complete dynamics model, terrain estimation, and whole-body control framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration and inspection robots often oversimplify calculations by ignoring dynamics or struggle with uneven terrain, thus limiting their full motion capability.

Method: The researchers created a 6-DOF robot dynamics model, incorporating closed-loop dynamics and terrain estimation using a LiDAR inertial odometry framework with improved PCA. PD control law, LQR, and hierarchical optimization were implemented for control.

Result: Real-world and simulation experiments validated the robustness and efficacy of the terrain estimation and whole-body control algorithm, enabling smooth uneven terrain traversal.

Conclusion: The approach greatly enhances the wheeled bipedal robot's adaptability and stability on uneven terrain, unlocking its motion potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Wheeled bipedal robots have garnered increasing attention in exploration and inspection. However, most research simplifies calculations by ignoring leg dynamics, thereby restricting the robot's full motion potential. Additionally, robots face challenges when traversing uneven terrain. To address the aforementioned issue, we develop a complete dynamics model and design a whole-body control framework with terrain estimation for a novel 6 degrees of freedom wheeled bipedal robot. This model incorporates the closed-loop dynamics of the robot and a ground contact model based on the estimated ground normal vector. We use a LiDAR inertial odometry framework and improved Principal Component Analysis for terrain estimation. Task controllers, including PD control law and LQR, are employed for pose control and centroidal dynamics-based balance control, respectively. Furthermore, a hierarchical optimization approach is used to solve the whole-body control problem. We validate the performance of the terrain estimation algorithm and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and ability to traverse uneven terrain through both simulation and real-world experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sim-to-real transfer gap in bipedal locomotion control using DRL, which limits practical implementation due to discrepancies in simulation and real-world dynamics.

Method: Analyzes sources of sim-to-real gap (robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, numerical solvers) and presents two strategies: 1) improving simulator fidelity, 2) training robust policies and adapting post-deployment.

Result: Provides a strategic framework combining simulator fidelity enhancement and robust policy training to tackle sim-to-real challenges effectively.

Conclusion: The integration of both strategies offers a comprehensive approach for sim-to-real transfer in DRL, paving a pathway for bipedal locomotion applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This chapter addresses the critical challenge of simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in bipedal locomotion. After contextualizing the problem within various control architectures, we dissect the ``curse of simulation'' by analyzing the primary sources of sim-to-real gap: robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers. Building on this diagnosis, we structure the solutions around two complementary philosophies. The first is to shrink the gap through model-centric strategies that systematically improve the simulator's physical fidelity. The second is to harden the policy, a complementary approach that uses in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation to make the policy inherently resilient to model inaccuracies. The chapter concludes by synthesizing these philosophies into a strategic framework, providing a clear roadmap for developing and evaluating robust sim-to-real solutions.

### [558] [A Low-Rank Method for Vision Language Model Hallucination Mitigation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06496)
*Keke Long,Jiacheng Guo,Tianyun Zhang,Hongkai Yu,Xiaopeng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a low-rank approach to rank captions generated by Vision Language Models (VLMs) based on hallucination levels, achieving improvements in accuracy and inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of hallucinations in VLMs used in autonomous driving, where ground-truth references and model internals are unavailable.

Method: Proposed a self-contained approach using sentence-embedding matrix decomposition into a low-rank consensus and sparse residual to rank candidate captions based on their hallucination levels.

Result: The method achieved 87% accuracy in selecting hallucination-free captions on the NuScenes dataset, outperforming baseline and debate-based methods by 19% and 6-10%, respectively.

Conclusion: The approach effectively identifies hallucination-free captions with high accuracy, correlates with human judgments, and reduces inference time, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous driving to help understand traffic scenes, but they sometimes produce hallucinations, which are false details not grounded in the visual input. Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method, which can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to debate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical control framework for PID controllers combining meta-learning for initialization and reinforcement learning for online adaptation, tested on two robotic platforms with sample-efficient augmentation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tuning of PID controllers for varied robotic systems is time-intensive, requiring significant expertise.

Method: A hierarchical control system integrating meta-learning for PID initialization and reinforcement learning for adaptation, supported by a physics-based data augmentation strategy.

Result: The approach improved performance significantly on two robotic platforms, demonstrating robust results under disturbances and optimization ceiling effects in RL performance.

Conclusion: The results highlight the dependency of RL performance on meta-learning quality, offering valuable insights for designing hierarchical control systems in robotics.

Abstract: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers remain the predominant choice in industrial robotics due to their simplicity and reliability. However, manual tuning of PID parameters for diverse robotic platforms is time-consuming and requires extensive domain expertise. This paper presents a novel hierarchical control framework that combines meta-learning for PID initialization and reinforcement learning (RL) for online adaptation. To address the sample efficiency challenge, a \textit{physics-based data augmentation} strategy is introduced that generates virtual robot configurations by systematically perturbing physical parameters, enabling effective meta-learning with limited real robot data. The proposed approach is evaluated on two heterogeneous platforms: a 9-DOF Franka Panda manipulator and a 12-DOF Laikago quadruped robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 16.6\% average improvement on Franka Panda (6.26° MAE), with exceptional gains in high-load joints (J2: 80.4\% improvement from 12.36° to 2.42°). Critically, this work discovers the \textit{optimization ceiling effect}: RL achieves dramatic improvements when meta-learning exhibits localized high-error joints, but provides no benefit (0.0\%) when baseline performance is uniformly strong, as observed in Laikago. The method demonstrates robust performance under disturbances (parameter uncertainty: +19.2\%, no disturbance: +16.6\%, average: +10.0\%) with only 10 minutes of training time. Multi-seed analysis across 100 random initializations confirms stable performance (4.81+/-1.64\% average). These results establish that RL effectiveness is highly dependent on meta-learning baseline quality and error distribution, providing important design guidance for hierarchical control systems.

*Cormac O'Neill,Jasmine Terrones,H. Harry Asada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper focuses on simplifying the challenge of robot control under dynamic contact scenarios using Koopman operators, enabling efficient control strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the difficulty of controlling robots during dynamic contact changes, which involves complex switching of dynamics and non-convex optimization problems.

Method: Employing Koopman operators to unify segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a globally-linear model in an embedding space.

Result: Enabling convex Model Predictive Control for legged robots and real-time control for manipulators in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method allows robots to find advanced control strategies efficiently across multiple contact changes, with potential applications extending beyond robotics.

Abstract: Controlling robots that dynamically engage in contact with their environment is a pressing challenge. Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing. In this work, we show that our method allows robots to discover elaborate control strategies in real-time over time horizons with multiple contact changes, and the method is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents CoFineLLM, a finetuning framework for large language models (LLMs) to make their predictions more reliable by minimizing prediction-set size, ultimately reducing human intervention in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of unreliable predictions by large language models (LLMs), especially in long-horizon tasks, and the frequent need for human intervention due to overly large uncertainty-aware prediction sets.

Method: The authors introduce CoFineLLM, a finetuning framework that makes LLMs explicitly aware of Conformal Prediction (CP) to reduce the size of uncertainty-based prediction sets.

Result: CoFineLLM demonstrates improved performance, reducing prediction-set size and required help rates in language-instructed robot planning tasks, as well as robustness in out-of-distribution hardware experiments.

Conclusion: CoFineLLM enhances the usability and autonomy of LLM-based planners by making their predictions more reliable and reducing dependency on human feedback during task execution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as planners for language-instructed agents, generating sequences of actions to accomplish natural language tasks. However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental question of how VLAs leverage vision-semantic priors from VLMs for generalizable embodied control.

Method: Designing the GrinningFace emoji tabletop manipulation task and implementing it in simulation and on a real robot to systematically evaluate techniques for transferring VLM knowledge to VLAs.

Result: Reveals the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for VLA generalization and evaluates various techniques for effective knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights effective methods for leveraging VLM priors and sets guidelines for future research in generalizable embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.

*Andrew Choi,Dezhong Tong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisMech, an implicit soft-body simulator, to facilitate faster and accurate policy learning for soft robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the lack of efficient soft robotic simulation frameworks, which deter policy learning in soft robotics compared to rigid-body simulations.

Method: The authors utilize DisMech, an implicit soft-body simulator with delta natural curvature control for intuitive manipulation and conduct comparisons with the Elastica framework.

Result: DisMech achieved significantly faster speeds (up to 40x for contact-rich scenarios) and demonstrated accurate sim-to-sim transferability without loss of precision.

Conclusion: Implicit time-stepping with DisMech enables rapid soft robot policy learning, bridging the gap in soft robotics simulation frameworks.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to exploit the design freedom inherent in soft robotics while addressing the challenge posed by the curse of dimensionality in designing complex structures.

Method: The researchers developed PTSPAs that extend axially upon inflation, a geometry generator for customizable models, and conducted systematic experiments to map design-performance relationships.

Result: The study revealed relationships between design parameters and actuator performance, such as extension, bending, expansion, and stiffness. Demonstrated advancements with deployable soft quadruped legs.

Conclusion: PTSPAs are shown to be effective for deployable, adaptive, and shape-morphing structures, broadening possibilities for confined space manipulation and large-scale length transformations.

Abstract: Soft Robotics presents a rich canvas for free-form and continuum devices capable of exerting forces in any direction and transforming between arbitrary configurations. However, there is no current way to tractably and directly exploit the design freedom due to the curse of dimensionality. Parameterisable sets of designs offer a pathway towards tractable, modular soft robotics that appropriately harness the behavioural freeform of soft structures to create rich embodied behaviours. In this work, we present a parametrised class of soft actuators, Programmable Telescopic Soft Pneumatic Actuators (PTSPAs). PTSPAs expand axially on inflation for deployable structures and manipulation in challenging confined spaces. We introduce a parametric geometry generator to customise actuator models from high-level inputs, and explore the new design space through semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key parameters. Using it we characterise the actuators' extension/bending, expansion, and stiffness and reveal clear relationships between key design parameters and performance. Finally we demonstrate the application of the actuators in a deployable soft quadruped whose legs deploy to walk, enabling automatic adaptation to confined spaces. PTSPAs present new design paradigm for deployable and shape morphing structures and wherever large length changes are required.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG) to address limitations in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by generating physically plausible goals using an enhanced VAE framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generating goals in self-supervised reinforcement learning, like RIG, suffer from producing unrealistic, physically implausible goals, which reduces learning efficiency.

Method: The authors devised PI-RIG, integrating physical constraints into goal generation via an Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder. This separates physics-based dynamics from visual factors in the latent space and applies physical consistency rules such as differential equations and conservation laws.

Result: In experiments, PI-RIG generated feasible and physically consistent goals, enabling better exploration and improved skill acquisition in robotic tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place operations.

Conclusion: Physics-informed goal generation enhances learning efficiency and robotic skill acquisition by ensuring generated goals adhere to physical principles.

Abstract: Self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning enables robots to autonomously acquire diverse skills without human supervision. However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this physics-informed goal generation significantly improves the quality of proposed goals, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semi-distributed relative localization framework for UAV-UGV collaboration, decoupling localization from state estimation and achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-robot SLAM systems lack flexibility and accuracy due to tight coupling of state estimation among robots and uniform sensor configurations.

Method: The proposed framework involves independent SLAM operations on UGV and UAV, deep learning-based keypoints extraction, local bundle adjustment using multiple sensors, and incremental loop closure detection.

Result: The framework achieves high accuracy and efficiency in relative localization, with minimal communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

Conclusion: The method offers a significant advancement in air-ground collaborative tasks, overcoming limitations in traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches, with publicly accessible codes and data.

Abstract: Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps. Codes and data will be publicly available on https://github.com/Ascbpiac/cross-model-relative-localization.git.

Method: The authors present (1) LIBERO+, a benchmark dataset with detailed object-centric annotations enabling reasoning over objects and relations, and (2) SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework capturing object-relations for decodeable robotic actions.

Result: SlotVLA demonstrates reduced visual token requirements and competitive generalization on LIBERO+, showing effectiveness of object-relation-centric approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework advance compact, interpretable, and effective strategies for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships, we explore whether compact object-centric and object-relation representations can form a foundation for multitask robotic manipulation. Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.

### [569] [Human-Level Actuation for Humanoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06796)
*MD-Nazmus Sunbeam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured framework to quantify claims of "human-level" actuation in humanoid robots by measuring key biomechanical factors and defining standards for comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots frequently claim "human-level" actuation, but these claims lack standardized metrics for comparison or quantification, making it hard to evaluate their capabilities effectively.

Method: The study presents a framework with three key components: a kinematic DoF atlas for standardized joint comparison, Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE) to assess torque and power requirements, and the Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS), combining functional factors such as workspace coverage, efficiency, and sustainability.

Result: The methodology provides reproducible measurement protocols and applies the framework to a humanoid robot, showcasing the computation of HLAS and the exposure of actuator trade-offs such as gearing ratio versus bandwidth and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a standardized method for designing and benchmarking humanoid actuation systems, providing a measurable approach based on human biomechanics data.

Abstract: Claims that humanoid robots achieve ``human-level'' actuation are common but rarely quantified. Peak torque or speed specifications tell us little about whether a joint can deliver the right combination of torque, power, and endurance at task-relevant postures and rates. We introduce a comprehensive framework that makes ``human-level'' measurable and comparable across systems. Our approach has three components. First, a kinematic \emph{DoF atlas} standardizes joint coordinate systems and ranges of motion using ISB-based conventions, ensuring that human and robot joints are compared in the same reference frames. Second, \emph{Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE)} define per-joint requirements by measuring whether a robot meets human torque \emph{and} power simultaneously at the same joint angle and rate $(q,ω)$, weighted by positive mechanical work in task-specific bands (walking, stairs, lifting, reaching, and hand actions). Third, the \emph{Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage (ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability. We provide detailed measurement protocols using dynamometry, electrical power monitoring, and thermal testing that yield every HLAS input from reproducible experiments. A worked example demonstrates HLAS computation for a multi-joint humanoid, showing how the score exposes actuator trade-offs (gearing ratio versus bandwidth and efficiency) that peak-torque specifications obscure. The framework serves as both a design specification for humanoid development and a benchmarking standard for comparing actuation systems, with all components grounded in published human biomechanics data.

*Praveen Kumar,Tushar Sandhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in autonomous robots navigating human-centric environments by introducing a robust, cost-effective framework integrating semantic perception with real-time path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is the lack of integration of semantic perception in traditional navigation systems, which prevents efficient and context-aware navigation in environments requiring recognition of critical visual cues.

Method: The method combines a lightweight semantic segmentation module with an online A* path planner, fusing geometric and semantic data to identify and avoid contextually important obstacles in navigation.

Result: The framework successfully facilitates real-time navigation for cost-effective robots in complex environments, validated through simulations and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The study proves the feasibility of integrating semantic segmentation with path planning to bridge the gap in context-aware navigation, enabling affordable robots to operate effectively in varying scenarios.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous service robots in human-centric environments is hindered by a critical gap in perception and planning. Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-agent AI framework combining multimodal large language models with vision-based perception for road-situation monitoring. Evaluated on a custom dataset, it achieves high recall but exhibits false positives and semantic understanding issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome limitations in conventional road-situation detection methods that struggle in non-predefined scenarios and lack semantic interpretation, which is vital for reliable traffic recommendations.

Method: It introduces a framework integrating multimodal large language models and vision-based perception to process camera feeds and execute functions like situation detection, distance estimation, and message generation.

Result: The proposed method achieves 100% recall in situation detection and perfect message schema correctness but has weaknesses in false-positive detections and understanding attributes like lane status and cause code.

Conclusion: While achieving strong detection performance, the system has limitations, such as accuracy gaps, motivating further efforts to fine-tune specialized language models for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Conventional road-situation detection methods achieve strong performance in predefined scenarios but fail in unseen cases and lack semantic interpretation, which is crucial for reliable traffic recommendations. This work introduces a multi-agent AI framework that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vision-based perception for road-situation monitoring. The framework processes camera feeds and coordinates dedicated agents for situation detection, distance estimation, decision-making, and Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) message generation. Evaluation is conducted on a custom dataset of 103 images extracted from 20 videos of the TAD dataset. Both Gemini-2.0-Flash and Gemini-2.5-Flash were evaluated. The results show 100\% recall in situation detection and perfect message schema correctness; however, both models suffer from false-positive detections and have reduced performance in terms of number of lanes, driving lane status and cause code. Surprisingly, Gemini-2.5-Flash, though more capable in general tasks, underperforms Gemini-2.0-Flash in detection accuracy and semantic understanding and incurs higher latency (Table II). These findings motivate further work on fine-tuning specialized LLMs or MLLMs tailored for intelligent transportation applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automotive ego-motion estimation relies on sensors like IMUs and wheel odometry, which suffer from systematic errors and limited calibration accuracy. Incorporating visual SLAM offers potential to improve performance.

Method: A framework is developed that fuses visual SLAM with lateral vehicle dynamics to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic driving conditions.

Result: Experimental results validate that integrating vision improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and achieves superior localization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on proprietary and public datasets.

Conclusion: Vision-based integration enhances automotive localization accuracy, providing a viable route for more accurate positioning in consumer vehicles.

Abstract: Accurate ego-motion estimation in consumer-grade vehicles currently relies on proprioceptive sensors, i.e. wheel odometry and IMUs, whose performance is limited by systematic errors and calibration. While visual-inertial SLAM has become a standard in robotics, its integration into automotive ego-motion estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates how visual SLAM can be integrated into consumer-grade vehicle localization systems to improve performance. We propose a framework that fuses visual SLAM with a lateral vehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic driving conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that vision-based integration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and thus enhances overall localization performance, highlighting a promising path toward higher automotive localization accuracy. We provide results on both proprietary and public datasets, showing improved performance and superior localization accuracy on a public benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of underwater positioning due to GNSS signal limitations and provide a low-cost, open-source solution for researchers in underwater robotics.

Method: Developed Raspi$^2$USBL, incorporating a modular hardware design (e.g., hydrophone array, Raspberry Pi 5, DAQ board, etc.), and an open-source C++ framework for precise acoustic positioning using time-of-flight and direction of arrival calculations.

Result: Experimentally validated in various environments (anechoic tank, lake, sea) showing slant-range accuracy < 0.1%, bearing accuracy within 0.1°, and operational performance up to 1.3 km.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates low-cost hardware achieving high accuracy for underwater positioning, eliminating barriers for research and fostering innovation in underwater robotics through open-source collaboration.

Abstract: Precise underwater positioning remains a fundamental challenge for underwater robotics since global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals cannot penetrate the sea surface. This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer. An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF) and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea trials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing accuracy within 0.1$^\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances up to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can deliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the hardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified reference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics laboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in underwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenge of depth perception in robotic manipulation, especially concerning transparent and reflective objects, which conventional sensors struggle with.

Method: HDCNet integrates Transformers, CNNs, and Mamba architectures. It employs dual-branch Transformer-CNN for modality-specific feature extraction and multimodal fusion modules for feature integration. High-level semantic fusion is facilitated by a Transformer-Mamba hybrid.

Result: HDCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in depth completion tasks on public datasets and improves robotic grasp success rates for reflective and transparent objects by up to 60%.

Conclusion: HDCNet significantly advances depth perception technologies, enhancing robotic grasp capabilities for challenging surfaces through novel architecture integration.

Abstract: Depth perception of transparent and reflective objects has long been a critical challenge in robotic manipulation.Conventional depth sensors often fail to provide reliable measurements on such surfaces, limiting the performance of robots in perception and grasping tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel depth completion network,HDCNet,which integrates the complementary strengths of Transformer,CNN and Mamba architectures.Specifically,the encoder is designed as a dual-branch Transformer-CNN framework to extract modality-specific features. At the shallow layers of the encoder, we introduce a lightweight multimodal fusion module to effectively integrate low-level features. At the network bottleneck,a Transformer-Mamba hybrid fusion module is developed to achieve deep integration of high-level semantic and global contextual information, significantly enhancing depth completion accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that HDCNet achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance in depth completion tasks.Furthermore,robotic grasping experiments show that HDCNet substantially improves grasp success rates for transparent and reflective objects,achieving up to a 60% increase.

*Thomas Steinecker,Alexander Bienemann,Denis Trescher,Thorsten Luettel,Mirko Maehlisch*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in transferring RL-trained agents from simulation to real vehicles by introducing an alignment framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying RL on real vehicles is difficult due to the mismatches between simulation-based dynamics and real-world complexities such as tire characteristics and road conditions.

Method: An RL agent is trained using a kinematic bicycle model, and its behavior is distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent to align virtual and real vehicle behaviors with control strategies like Stanley controller and adaptive updates.

Result: The framework is validated on a real vehicle and demonstrates successful zero-shot transfer of motion planning from simulation to reality, ensuring robust alignment and decoupling of trajectory generation/control.

Conclusion: The paper establishes an effective framework that overcomes mismatch challenges, enabling seamless RL deployment on real vehicles with decoupled high-level and low-level control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in robotics, but deploying RL on real vehicles remains challenging due to the complexity of vehicle dynamics and the mismatch between simulation and reality. Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated roadmap generation method tailored for mobile robot fleets in intralogistics, improving system efficiency by addressing constraints and optimizing routes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of mobile robot fleets in intralogistics by tackling delays, deadlocks, and improving routing through well-designed roadmaps.

Method: The approach combines free space discretization, transport demand-based $K$-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing to create optimized roadmaps while considering practical constraints.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines in multiple intralogistics cases, achieving reduced complexity, better redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths.

Conclusion: The strategy enables efficient and robust routing, making mobile robot fleet navigation more practical and effective in industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient routing of mobile robot fleets is crucial in intralogistics, where delays and deadlocks can substantially reduce system throughput. Roadmap design, specifying feasible transport routes, directly affects fleet coordination and computational performance. Existing approaches are either grid-based, compromising geometric precision, or continuous-space approaches that disregard practical constraints. This paper presents an automated roadmap generation approach that bridges this gap by operating in continuous-space, integrating station-to-station transport demand and enforcing minimum distance constraints for nodes and edges. By combining free space discretization, transport demand-driven $K$-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing, the approach produces roadmaps tailored to intralogistics applications. Evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases demonstrates that the proposed approach consistently outperforms established baselines (4-connected grid, 8-connected grid, and random sampling), achieving lower structural complexity, higher redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths, enabling efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and compares human teleoperation with robotic teleoperation in medical ultrasound, highlighting their practical and performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expertise required for interpreting ultrasound imaging is scarce in rural areas, leading to travel difficulties and long wait times. The paper aims to address this gap by evaluating tele-ultrasound techniques.

Method: The study compares human and robotic teleoperation in practical setup aspects and performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency.

Result: Human teleoperation shows no statistically significant differences compared to robotic teleoperation in completion time and position accuracy, but offers improved force application and greater practicality.

Conclusion: Human teleoperation can provide performance comparable to robotic systems while being more practical and accessible for small communities.

Abstract: Diagnostic medical ultrasound is widely used, safe, and relatively low cost but requires a high degree of expertise to acquire and interpret the images. Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities, leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations. To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed, including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy, with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and accessible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding in model failures and biases in autonomous driving research, which hampers significant progress.

Method: Systematic input perturbation analysis using PlanT 2.0, an object-centric transformer framework that allows focused study on autonomous driving in CARLA.

Result: PlanT 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple CARLA benchmarks and identifies key areas of model failure and biases in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: The study advocates for data-centric development with richer and less biased datasets for improved autonomous driving models. The source code for PlanT 2.0 is shared publicly.

Abstract: Most recent work in autonomous driving has prioritized benchmark performance and methodological innovation over in-depth analysis of model failures, biases, and shortcut learning. This has led to incremental improvements without a deep understanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on these findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets. We open-source our code and model at https://github.com/autonomousvision/plant2.

Motivation: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful tool for defining spatial-temporal requirements, but existing synthesis methods typically suffer from approximation errors, which can limit precision and reliability in motion planning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a reliable and precise solution for STL-based motion planning, demonstrating its practical viability through simulations.

Abstract: We study motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic (STL), a useful formalism for specifying spatial-temporal requirements. We pose STL synthesis as a trajectory optimization problem leveraging the STL robustness semantics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces EquiTac, a framework that uses SO(2) symmetry to enhance visuotactile policy learning for manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high-cost tactile data collection and improve sample efficiency in visuotactile policy learning for robotic manipulation applications.

Method: EquiTac reconstructs surface normals from tactile sensor inputs and employs an SO(2)-equivariant network to predict residual rotation actions to augment a vision-based policy for real-time correction.

Result: EquiTac demonstrated robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with minimal training samples, surpassing baseline methods even with more data.

Conclusion: EquiTac shows that encoding tactile equivariance significantly improves policy reliability and efficiency in contact-rich tasks, establishing a novel approach to tactile learning with symmetry-aware modules.

Abstract: Visuotactile policy learning augments vision-only policies with tactile input, facilitating contact-rich manipulation. However, the high cost of tactile data collection makes sample efficiency the key requirement for developing visuotactile policies. We present EquiTac, a framework that exploits the inherent SO(2) symmetry of in-hand object rotation to improve sample efficiency and generalization for visuotactile policy learning. EquiTac first reconstructs surface normals from raw RGB inputs of vision-based tactile sensors, so rotations of the normal vector field correspond to in-hand object rotations. An SO(2)-equivariant network then predicts a residual rotation action that augments a base visuomotor policy at test time, enabling real-time rotation correction without additional reorientation demonstrations. On a real robot, EquiTac accurately achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples, where baselines fail even with more training data. To our knowledge, this is the first tactile learning method to explicitly encode tactile equivariance for policy learning, yielding a lightweight, symmetry-aware module that improves reliability in contact-rich tasks.

### [582] [Unified Humanoid Fall-Safety Policy from a Few Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07407)
*Zhengjie Xu,Ye Li,Kwan-yee Lin,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a unified system for humanoid robots to handle falls comprehensively, from prevention to quick recovery, using reinforcement learning and adaptive techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots are prone to falling, which is a critical safety issue. While existing approaches address individual aspects like avoiding falls or standing up, there is a lack of holistic strategies to handle the entire fall-and-recovery process, especially when falls are unavoidable.

Method: The authors use a combination of sparse human demonstrations, reinforcement learning, and adaptive diffusion-based memory to train robots on cohesive strategies for fall prevention, impact reduction, and recovery. Tested on the Unitree G1, the approach integrates all three phases into one adaptive policy.

Result: The experiments showed successful sim-to-real transfer, reduced impact forces, and faster recovery across diverse disturbances, demonstrating significant improvements in robot safety and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances humanoid robot resilience and safety in real-world environments by combining fall prevention, impact mitigation, and recovery into a seamless and effective system.

Abstract: Falling is an inherent risk of humanoid mobility. Maintaining stability is thus a primary safety focus in robot control and learning, yet no existing approach fully averts loss of balance. When instability does occur, prior work addresses only isolated aspects of falling: avoiding falls, choreographing a controlled descent, or standing up afterward. Consequently, humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for impact mitigation and prompt recovery when real falls defy these scripts. We aim to go beyond keeping balance to make the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous: prevent falls when possible, reduce impact when unavoidable, and stand up when fallen. By fusing sparse human demonstrations with reinforcement learning and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions, we learn adaptive whole-body behaviors that unify fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery in one policy. Experiments in simulation and on a Unitree G1 demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances, pointing towards safer, more resilient humanoids in real environments.

*Hao Wang,Sathwik Karnik,Bea Lim,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores the utilization of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of unpredictable and costly errors when using Large Language Models (LLMs) and VLMs for high-level robotic planning.

Method: Controlled experiments analyze control horizon and warm-starting to optimize VLMs' performance as symbolic planners.

Result: Insights and recommendations were developed to enhance the use of VLMs in closed-loop symbol planning.

Conclusion: VLMs have potential as symbolic planners for robotic applications, but optimizing their configuration is key for improving reliability and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used for embodied symbolic planning. Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PhysWorld creates an advanced framework for robots to learn tasks by combining video generation with physical world modeling, improving task accuracy without real robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of using synthesized videos for training robots, as direct application often fails to account for physical accuracy.

Method: The method involves generating task-specific video demonstrations, reconstructing the physical world from these videos, and translating video motions into precise robotic actions using object-centric reinforcement learning.

Result: PhysWorld performed significantly better in real-world task manipulation compared to previous baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed PhysWorld framework effectively bridges the gap between synthetic video guidance and physical robot interaction, enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation without real robot data collection.

Abstract: We introduce PhysWorld, a framework that enables robot learning from video generation through physical world modeling. Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

*Caetano Melone,Daniel Nichols,Konstantinos Parasyris,Todd Gamblin,Harshitha Menon*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpackIt, a framework that uses large language models and context-augmentation methods to enhance the creation and accuracy of Spack build recipes for HPC ecosystems. Results show a significant improvement in installation success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining and creating build recipes for heterogeneous HPC software ecosystems is a manual and increasingly labor-intensive task as the ecosystems grow in complexity.

Method: SpackIt combines repository analysis, retrieval of relevant examples, and iterative refinement using diagnostic feedback to automate the generation of Spack recipes.

Result: SpackIt improved installation success rates from 20% to over 80% for 308 HPC packages by using retrieval techniques and structured feedback mechanisms.

Conclusion: Using large language models with context-aware augmentation methods significantly enhances the reliability and automation of generating Spack recipes for HPC software ecosystems.

Abstract: High performance computing (HPC) software ecosystems are inherently heterogeneous, comprising scientific applications that depend on hundreds of external packages, each with distinct build systems, options, and dependency constraints. Tools such as Spack automate dependency resolution and environment management, but their effectiveness relies on manually written build recipes. As these ecosystems grow, maintaining existing specifications and creating new ones becomes increasingly labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, automatically producing correct and maintainable Spack recipes remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic analysis of how LLMs and context-augmentation methods can assist in the generation of Spack recipes. To this end, we introduce SpackIt, an end-to-end framework that combines repository analysis, retrieval of relevant examples, and iterative refinement through diagnostic feedback. We apply SpackIt to a representative subset of 308 open-source HPC packages to assess its effectiveness and limitations. Our results show that SpackIt increases installation success from 20% in a zero-shot setting to over 80% in its best configuration, demonstrating the value of retrieval and structured feedback for reliable package synthesis.

*Kawshik Kumar Paul,Sawmik Kumar Paul*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study introduces a controller-light CI/CD setup for Jenkins using containerized builds to reduce resource strain on the controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jenkins controllers often become overloaded due to performing resource-heavy builds locally, impacting system reliability.

Method: Jenkins is containerized to act solely as the orchestration layer, delegating heavy tasks to remote Docker hosts via SSH connections.

Result: Experimental analysis showed decreased system resource usage, faster build times, and lower artifact delivery latency on the Jenkins controller.

Conclusion: This scalable, low-maintenance pipeline is well-suited for small to medium DevOps teams aiming for efficient automation.

Abstract: Traditional Jenkins installations often perform resource-intensive builds directly on the controller, which can overload system resources and decrease reliability. This paper presents a controller-light CI/CD framework in which Jenkins runs as a containerized controller with persistent volumes, delegating heavy build and packaging operations to a remote Docker host. The controller container maintains secure SSH connections to remote compute nodes and focuses solely on orchestration and reporting. Atomic deployments with time-stamped backups, containerized build environments, immutable artifact packaging, and automatic notifications are all integrated into the system. Experimental evaluation shows reduced CPU and RAM usage on the controller, faster build throughput, and lower artifact delivery latency. For small and medium-sized DevOps organizations looking for scalable automation without adding orchestration complexity, this method offers a repeatable, low-maintenance CI/CD pipeline.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes FANDANGO-RS, a high-performance evolutionary language-based testing approach that generates test inputs for compilers faster by optimizing grammar handling and using advanced algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for language-based testing struggle with complex constraints and efficiency, limiting their applicability in areas like compiler testing.

Method: The authors transformed grammar definitions into Rust-based types for optimization and used advanced evolutionary algorithms to overcome constraints and enhance performance.

Result: Their prototype, FANDANGO-RS, achieves a 3-4 orders of magnitude improvement in performance, generating 401 valid C compiler test inputs per minute.

Conclusion: FANDANGO-RS successfully addresses constraint-solving inefficiencies in language-based testing, enabling rapid generation of diverse, complex test cases.

Abstract: Language-based testing combines context-free grammar definitions with semantic constraints over grammar elements to generate test inputs. By pairing context-free grammars with constraints, users have the expressiveness of unrestricted grammars while retaining simple structure. However, producing inputs in the presence of such constraints can be challenging. In past approaches, SMT solvers have been found to be very slow at finding string solutions; evolutionary algorithms are faster and more general, but current implementations still struggle with complex constraints that would be required for domains such as compiler testing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for evolutionary language-based testing that improves performance by 3-4 orders of magnitude over the current state of the art, reducing hours of generation and constraint solving time to seconds. We accomplish this by (1) carefully transforming grammar definitions into Rust types and trait implementations, ensuring that the compiler may near-maximally optimize arbitrary operations on arbitrary grammars; and (2) using better evolutionary algorithms that improve the ability of language-based testing to solve complex constraint systems. These performance and algorithmic improvements allow our prototype, FANDANGO-RS, to solve constraints that previous strategies simply cannot handle. We demonstrate this by a case study for a C subset, in which FANDANGO-RS is able to generate 401 diverse, complex, and valid test inputs for a C compiler per minute.

TL;DR: The study examines edits to Stack Overflow Java code answers and their integration into open-source projects, showcasing improved code quality and application of collaborative programming knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving software quality and reducing technical debt by using enhanced code snippets from Stack Overflow to address suboptimal or outdated code in open-source projects.

Method: Analyzed 140,840 Java answers from Stack Overflow alongside 10,668 GitHub Java projects using code clone search tools and manual categorization to suggest and test code improvements.

Result: 6.91% of SO Java accepted answers have multiple revisions (average 2.82). 49.24% of edited code snippets are applicable to open-source projects, and 11 out of 36 proposed bug fixes were accepted on GitHub.

Conclusion: Stack Overflow edits provide significant insights for enhancing open-source code quality, with many edited answers proving applicable and accepted by project maintainers.

Abstract: Suboptimal code is prevalent in software systems. Developers often write low-quality code due to factors like technical knowledge gaps, insufficient experience, time pressure, management decisions, or personal factors. Once integrated, the accumulation of this suboptimal code leads to significant maintenance costs and technical debt.
  Developers frequently consult external knowledge bases, such as API documentation and Q&A websites like Stack Overflow (SO), to aid their programming tasks. SO's crowdsourced, collaborative nature has created a vast repository of programming knowledge. Its community-curated content is constantly evolving, with new answers posted or existing ones edited.
  In this paper, we present an empirical study of SO Java answer edits and their application to improving code in open-source projects. We use a modified code clone search tool to analyze SO code snippets with version history and apply it to open-source Java projects. This identifies outdated or unoptimized code and suggests improved alternatives. Analyzing 140,840 Java accepted answers from SOTorrent and 10,668 GitHub Java projects, we manually categorized SO answer edits and created pull requests to open-source projects with the suggested code improvements. Our results show that 6.91% of SO Java accepted answers have more than one revision (average of 2.82). Moreover, 49.24% of the code snippets in the answer edits are applicable to open-source projects, and 11 out of 36 proposed bug fixes based on these edits were accepted by the GitHub project maintainers.

*Zishuo Xu,Dezhong Yao,Yao Wan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces WAR-Re, an advanced LLM-based model for Web API recommendation capable of providing semantic justifications and addressing varying API cardinalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve limitations in Web API recommendation, such as fixed top-N outputs that fail to adapt to dynamic API requirements, and the lack of reasoning accompanying the recommendations.

Method: WAR-Re handles varying API cardinalities using special tokens and utilizes supervised fine-tuning alongside reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: WAR-Re achieves a maximum improvement of 21.59% in recommendation accuracy compared to existing models and effectively generates semantic reasons for its suggestions.

Conclusion: WAR-Re effectively addresses the challenges in Web API recommendations with a significant improvement in accuracy and added semantic reasoning for better user understanding.

Abstract: With the development of cloud computing, the number of Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for efficient Web API recommendation. Despite the demonstrated success of previous Web API recommendation solutions, two critical challenges persist: 1) a fixed top-N recommendation that cannot accommodate the varying API cardinality requirements of different mashups, and 2) these methods output only ranked API lists without accompanying reasons, depriving users of understanding the recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose WAR-Re, an LLM-based model for Web API recommendation with semantic reasoning for justification. WAR-Re leverages special start and stop tokens to handle the first challenge and uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance the model's ability in both tasks. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WAR-Re achieves a gain of up to 21.59\% over the state-of-the-art baseline model in recommendation accuracy, while consistently producing high-quality semantic reasons for recommendations.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of COVID-19 remote work on Thai software developers, finding no significant changes in productivity and well-being, while both benefits and challenges were observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite existing studies on remote work during COVID-19, Thailand had not been specifically analyzed, even though it represents a growing software market in Asia.

Method: The study surveyed 194 Thai software developers about their experiences with remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Result: Thai software developers' productivity and well-being remained statistically unchanged during remote work. Both challenges and benefits were identified with some unique differences from other regions.

Conclusion: Insights about remote work from this study could inform strategies for other Asian or low- to middle-income countries facing similar situations.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the way of working, including software development. During the pandemic, software companies were forced to work remotely, and many companies have been using such work arrangements. There are prior studies showing the benefits and drawbacks of remote work in software development during COVID-19. However, there is no study that targets Thailand, one of the growing software markets in Asia, specifically. This paper performs an empirical study of the effects of COVID-19 on software development in Thailand. We surveyed 194 Thai software developers regarding the challenges and benefits they faced while working remotely during the COVID-19 period. The results show no statistically significant changes in the productivity and well-being of Thai software developers before and after working remotely due to the pandemic. The results show that software developers in Thailand both received benefits and faced challenges from remote work during COVID-19, similar to results reported by other studies, but with some unique differences. This study can be beneficial to similar Asian countries or other low- and middle-income countries around the world.

TL;DR: This paper presents an intelligent data acquisition and analysis system to evaluate students' debugging ability using a VS Code plugin, capturing debugging behavior for improved teaching effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional assessment methods struggle to fully evaluate students' programming debugging capabilities, necessitating a more effective and precise approach.

Method: The system integrates debugging tasks within a VS Code plugin to gather real-time debugging data, analyze it using an abstract syntax tree-based model with advanced techniques like node annotation and sequence recognition.

Result: The system successfully supports complex debugging scenarios, identifies debugging directions and behavior patterns, refines debugging analysis, and proves its feasibility through teaching tests.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates a reliable tool for procedural evaluation in programming debugging, enhancing teaching outcomes and advancing debugging behavior analysis methodologies.

Abstract: In order to meet the needs of students' programming debugging ability training, this paper designs and implements a data acquisition and analysis system for programming debugging process based on VS Code plug-in, which aims to solve the limitation of traditional assessment methods that are difficult to fully evaluate students' debugging ability. The system supports a variety of programming languages, integrates debugging tasks and data acquisition functions, captures students' debugging behavior in the local editor in real time, and uploads the data to the platform database to realize the whole process monitoring and feedback, provides accurate debugging guidance for teachers, and improves the teaching effect. In terms of data analysis, the system proposed a debugging behavior analysis model based on abstract syntax tree, combined with node annotation, sequence recognition and cluster analysis and other technologies, to automatically track the context of students' debugging process and accurately identify key features in the debugging path. Through this tool, the system realizes the intelligent identification and labeling of the debugging direction and behavior pattern, and improves the refinement level of debugging data analysis. In this research system, a complex debugging scenario of multi-file and multi-task is introduced into the debugging problem design, which optimizes the multi-dimensional capturing ability of debugging data and lays a foundation for accurate debugging behavior analysis. Through several practical teaching tests, the feasibility and stability of the system are verified, which proves that it can effectively support procedural evaluation in programming debugging teaching, and provides a new direction for debugging behavior analysis research.

### [594] [ZeroLog: Zero-Label Generalizable Cross-System Log-based Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05862)
*Xinlong Zhao,Tong Jia,Minghua He,Ying Li,Gang Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ZeroLog provides zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection using representation meta-learning and unsupervised domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of zero-label log-based anomaly detection across systems, ensuring stability of software systems.

Method: ZeroLog employs system-agnostic representation meta-learning combined with adversarial training for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Result: Achieves over 80% F1-score in anomaly detection on three public datasets without requiring any labels.

Conclusion: ZeroLog successfully achieves effective anomaly detection in zero-label settings, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is an important task in ensuring the stability and reliability of software systems. One of the key problems in this task is the lack of labeled logs. Existing works usually leverage large-scale labeled logs from mature systems to train an anomaly detection model of a target system based on the idea of transfer learning. However, these works still require a certain number of labeled logs from the target system. In this paper, we take a step forward and study a valuable yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log-based anomaly detection, that is, no labeled logs are available in the target system. Specifically, we propose ZeroLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that enables cross-system log-based anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. To achieve this, we leverage unsupervised domain adaptation to perform adversarial training between the source and target domains, aiming to learn system-agnostic general feature representations. By employing meta-learning, the learned representations are further generalized to the target system without any target labels. Experimental results on three public log datasets from different systems show that ZeroLog reaches over 80% F1-score without labels, comparable to state-of-the-art cross-system methods trained with labeled logs, and outperforms existing methods under zero-label conditions.

*Xinlong Zhao,Tong Jia,Minghua He,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GeneralLog is a collaborative method combining LLMs and small models for log anomaly detection across systems without requiring labeled target logs, achieving high F1-scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of labeled logs limits effective anomaly detection across different software systems, necessitating innovative methods for cross-system transfer.

Method: GeneralLog dynamically routes logs to either an LLM or a small model based on proprietary versus general knowledge separation in a zero-label setting.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets demonstrated GeneralLog consistently achieving over 90% F1-score in fully zero-label cross-system settings.

Conclusion: GeneralLog significantly outperforms existing methods by enabling effective cross-system log anomaly detection without reliance on labeled target logs.

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring software system stability. However, the scarcity of labeled logs limits rapid deployment to new systems. Cross-system transfer has become an important research direction. State-of-the-art approaches perform well with a few labeled target logs, but limitations remain: small-model methods transfer general knowledge but overlook mismatches with the target system's proprietary knowledge; LLM-based methods can capture proprietary patterns but rely on a few positive examples and incur high inference cost. Existing LLM-small model collaborations route 'simple logs' to the small model and 'complex logs' to the LLM based on output uncertainty. In zero-label cross-system settings, supervised sample complexity is unavailable, and such routing does not consider knowledge separation. To address this, we propose GeneralLog, a novel LLM-small model collaborative method for zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection. GeneralLog dynamically routes unlabeled logs, letting the LLM handle 'proprietary logs' and the small model 'general logs,' enabling cross-system generalization without labeled target logs. Experiments on three public log datasets show that GeneralLog achieves over 90% F1-score under a fully zero-label setting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

*Jeffrey Jian Ma,Milad Hashemi,Amir Yazdanbakhsh,Kevin Swersky,Ofir Press,Enhui Li,Vijay Janapa Reddi,Parthasarathy Ranganathan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-fficiency, a benchmark designed to evaluate repository-level performance optimization across several popular software repositories, emphasizing how to optimize code performance rather than identifying errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in benchmarks that focus on code performance optimization techniques rather than just identifying errors or what should be fixed in repositories.

Method: SWE-fficiency benchmark includes tasks requiring analyzing code semantics, identifying bottlenecks, and patching code for performance improvements while preserving correctness. An automated pipeline is used to scrape GitHub data to confirm baselines and validate edits.

Result: State-of-the-art agents are shown to struggle significantly, achieving less than 0.15x the expert speedup on average due to challenges in optimization localization, execution reasoning, and edit correctness.

Conclusion: SWE-fficiency is released as a benchmark and pipeline to support further research on automated performance engineering and enhance software reasoning capabilities in agents.

Abstract: Optimizing the performance of large-scale software repositories demands expertise in code reasoning and software engineering (SWE) to reduce runtime while preserving program correctness. However, most benchmarks emphasize what to fix rather than how to fix code. We introduce \textsc{SWE-fficiency}, a benchmark for evaluating repository-level performance optimization on real workloads. Our suite contains 498 tasks across nine widely used data-science, machine-learning, and HPC repositories (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy): given a complete codebase and a slow workload, an agent must investigate code semantics, localize bottlenecks and relevant tests, and produce a patch that matches or exceeds expert speedup while passing the same unit tests. To enable this how-to-fix evaluation, our automated pipeline scrapes GitHub pull requests for performance-improving edits, combining keyword filtering, static analysis, coverage tooling, and execution validation to both confirm expert speedup baselines and identify relevant repository unit tests. Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents reveals significant underperformance. On average, agents achieve less than 0.15x the expert speedup: agents struggle in localizing optimization opportunities, reasoning about execution across functions, and maintaining correctness in proposed edits. We release the benchmark and accompanying data pipeline to facilitate research on automated performance engineering and long-horizon software reasoning.

*Miguel Goulão,Vasco Amaral,Marjan Mernik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study aggregates findings on the impact of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) on software quality by conducting a tertiary review of 22 systematic literature reviews, identifying maintainability as the most studied attribute and highlighting the need for more empirical research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to consolidate scattered evidence on the impact of MDE on software quality, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to access, understand, and identify gaps in MDE research.

Method: The authors performed a tertiary study, analyzing 22 systematic literature reviews and mapping studies, to identify the quality attributes studied in the context of MDE and assess recurring research questions.

Result: The study found that maintainability is the most frequently addressed quality attribute of MDE. Most research has focused on mapping existing studies instead of answering concrete comparative questions. Broad coverage of software product quality was noted, but empirical validation of current claims is still lacking.

Conclusion: A significant knowledge base exists on MDE's impact on software quality, though gaps remain, particularly regarding quality in use and empirical validation of claims, necessitating further research efforts in these areas.

Abstract: Model-driven engineering (MDE) is believed to have a significant impact in software quality. However, researchers and practitioners may have a hard time locating consolidated evidence on this impact, as the available information is scattered in several different publications. Our goal is to aggregate consolidated findings on quality in MDE, facilitating the work of researchers and practitioners in learning about the coverage and main findings of existing work as well as identifying relatively unexplored niches of research that need further attention. We performed a tertiary study on quality in MDE, in order to gain a better understanding of its most prominent findings and existing challenges, as reported in the literature. We identified 22 systematic literature reviews and mapping studies and the most relevant quality attributes addressed by each of those studies, in the context of MDE. Maintainability is clearly the most often studied and reported quality attribute impacted by MDE. Eighty out of 83 research questions in the selected secondary studies have a structure that is more often associated with mapping existing research than with answering more concrete research questions (e.g., comparing two alternative MDE approaches with respect to their impact on a specific quality attribute). We briefly outline the main contributions of each of the selected literature reviews. In the collected studies, we observed a broad coverage of software product quality, although frequently accompanied by notes on how much more empirical research is needed to further validate existing claims. Relatively, little attention seems to be devoted to the impact of MDE on the quality in use of products developed using MDE.

*Mafalda Santos,Catarina Gralha,Miguel Goulão,João Araújo,Ana Moreira*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether an alternative i* syntax with increased semantic transparency improves understanding and reviewing of i* models, concluding that it reduces visual effort but doesn’t significantly improve accuracy or speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and interpretation challenges of i* models and explore the potential benefits of increased semantic transparency in its concrete syntax.

Method: The study conducted a quasi-experiment with 57 novice participants to compare the standard i* syntax and an alternative syntax with semantic transparency by analyzing task accuracy, speed, and ease using eye-tracking data and feedback.

Result: No significant improvements were found in accuracy or speed with the alternative syntax. However, participants needed less visual effort when using the alternative syntax for tasks.

Conclusion: While alternative syntax with greater semantic transparency doesn't improve understanding or speed, it lowers visual effort, suggesting usability benefits worth further consideration.

Abstract: Context: i* is one of the most influential languages in the Requirements Engineering research community. Perhaps due to its complexity and low adoption in industry, it became a natural candidate for studies aiming at improving its concrete syntax and the stakeholders' ability to correctly interpret i* models.
  Objectives: We evaluate the impact of semantic transparency on understanding and reviewing i* models, in the presence of a language key. Methods: We performed a quasi-experiment comparing the standard i* concrete syntax with an alternative that has an increased semantic transparency. We asked 57 novice participants to perform understanding and reviewing tasks on i* models, and measured their accuracy, speed and ease, using metrics of task success, time and effort, collected with eye-tracking and participants' feedback.
  Results: We found no evidence of improved accuracy or speed attributable to the alternative concrete syntax. Although participants' perceived ease was similar, they devoted significantly less visual effort to the model and the provided language key, when using the alternative concrete syntax.
  Conclusions: The context provided by the model and language key may mitigate the i* symbol recognition deficit reported in previous works. However, the alternative concrete syntax required a significantly lower visual effort.

There is an urgent need for transitioning industrial processes to more sustainable systems like the Circular Economy, focusing on resource and product reallocation.

Method: To enhance the reliability of service pricing and condition assessment in the Circular Economy, the authors propose the Lifecycle Workbench (LCW) ecosystem that leverages digital representations to detect item conditions and streamline service operations.

Result: The Lifecycle Workbench (LCW) addresses service pricing uncertainties and reduces economic risks for providers by improving assessment capabilities in product lifecycles within the Circular Economy.

Conclusion: The LCW ecosystem offers a promising approach to improving sustainability in industrial processes by resolving pricing and product condition assessment challenges, advancing the effectiveness of Circular Economy practices.

Abstract: The global production of electric goods is at an all-time high, causing negative environmental and health impacts as well as a continuing depletion of natural resources. Considering the worsening global climate change, a transition of current industrial processes is necessary to tackle the above-mentioned factors. To address this urgent issue, socio-economic systems like the Circular Economy (CE) provide options to reallocate the use of resources and products on a global scale. Especially in terms of product lifecycle-prolonging, this system provides suitable approaches to alter the current modes of product handling by society and industry alike, based on the condition of the products. Although the importance and benefits of sustainable services enabling these options are widely known, users tend to shy away from using them. One of the reasons is the missing reliability in terms of the knowledge of the costs associated with a particular service. This uncertainty in expected pricing can, therefore, lower the willingness of potential clients. However, not only clients struggle with the boundary conditions of such services. On the part of the potential providers of services, the monetary risk is often caused by the incapability to detect the condition of a product in advance. This can result on the provider side in a severe economic loss if this possibility is not covered by the service price or through the mass of items, which could allow equalization of serval service operations. To address these weak points in current service execution, the authors propose the \textit{Lifecycle Workbench (LCW)}-ecosystem, which features digital representations to enhance the reliability of service pricing as well as the assessment of the condition of items, assemblies, and parts in the Circular Economy domain.

Result: Four primary types of build errors were identified, and repair strategies resolved 75.56% of initial failures. LLM assistance demonstrated a 53.3% success rate in suggesting fixes.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable insights on improving Android application build reliability and emphasize AI's role in software maintenance advancements.

Abstract: Building Android applications reliably remains a persistent challenge due to complex dependencies, diverse configurations, and the rapid evolution of the Android ecosystem. This study conducts an empirical analysis of 200 open-source Android projects written in Java and Kotlin to diagnose and resolve build failures. Through a five-phase process encompassing data collection, build execution, failure classification, repair strategy design, and LLM-assisted evaluation, we identified four primary types of build errors: environment issues, dependency and Gradle task errors, configuration problems, and syntax/API incompatibilities. Among the 135 projects that initially failed to build, our diagnostic and repair strategy enabled developers to resolve 102 cases (75.56%), significantly reducing troubleshooting effort. We further examined the potential of Large Language Models, such as GPT-5, to assist in error diagnosis, achieving a 53.3% success rate in suggesting viable fixes. An analysis of project attributes revealed that build success is influenced by programming language, project age, and app size. These findings provide practical insights into improving Android build reliability and advancing AI-assisted software maintenance.

*Anamul Haque Mollah,Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores how effective prompting impacts the performance of LLMs in summarizing unit tests, presenting a benchmark dataset and conducting evaluations with multiple models and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in summarizing unit tests due to the lack of concise summaries, especially in scenarios with auto-generated or poorly documented codebases, and to leverage LLM advancements for solving this issue.

Method: The paper introduces a new benchmark of 91 Java test cases with developer-written summaries and conducts controlled ablation studies to evaluate how specific test-related components affect LLM-generated summaries. It compares four LLMs across seven prompt configurations.

Result: The study reveals that prompting with assertion semantics improves summary quality, achieving an average improvement of 2.3%. Codex and Qwen-Coder are the most effective models, while DeepSeek underperforms despite lexical similarity.

Conclusion: Integrating assertion semantics into prompts enhances the performance of LLMs in summarizing test codes. Codex and Qwen-Coder show promising alignment with human-written summaries, indicating potential for advanced applications in test documentation.

Abstract: Unit tests often lack concise summaries that convey test intent, especially in auto-generated or poorly documented codebases. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how they are prompted. Unlike generic code summarization, test-code summarization poses distinct challenges because test methods validate expected behavior through assertions rather than im- plementing functionality. This paper presents a new benchmark of 91 real-world Java test cases paired with developer-written summaries and conducts a controlled ablation study to investigate how test code-related components-such as the method under test (MUT), assertion messages, and assertion semantics-affect the performance of LLM-generated test summaries. We evaluate four code LLMs (Codex, Codestral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder) across seven prompt configurations using n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR), semantic similarity (BERTScore), and LLM-based evaluation. Results show that prompting with as- sertion semantics improves summary quality by an average of 0.10 points (2.3%) over full MUT context (4.45 vs. 4.35) while requiring fewer input tokens. Codex and Qwen-Coder achieve the highest alignment with human-written summaries, while DeepSeek underperforms despite high lexical overlap.

*Mingde Xu,Zhen Yang,Wenyi Hong,Lihang Pan,Xinyue Fan,Yan Wang,Xiaotao Gu,Bin Xu,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: WebVIA offers a novel approach for automating interactive UI-to-Code generation, improving accuracy and interactivity compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI-to-Code processes and tools focus on converting designs into static layouts, lacking interaction capabilities, which limits automation efficiency.

Method: WebVIA integrates an exploration agent for UI screenshot capture, a model for interactive code generation, and a validation module to ensure functional interactivity.

Result: WebVIA achieved higher performance in stability and accuracy for UI exploration and superior interactive code generation results compared to general-purpose agents and baseline models.

Conclusion: WebVIA establishes itself as a robust framework for interactive UI-to-Code automation, enhancing coding efficiency through improved exploration and validation capabilities.

Abstract: User interface (UI) development requires translating design mockups into functional code, a process that remains repetitive and labor-intensive. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) automate UI-to-Code generation, they generate only static HTML/CSS/JavaScript layouts lacking interactivity. To address this, we propose WebVIA, the first agentic framework for interactive UI-to-Code generation and validation. The framework comprises three components: 1) an exploration agent to capture multi-state UI screenshots; 2) a UI2Code model that generates executable interactive code; 3) a validation module that verifies the interactivity. Experiments demonstrate that WebVIA-Agent achieves more stable and accurate UI exploration than general-purpose agents (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). In addition, our fine-tuned WebVIA-UI2Code models exhibit substantial improvements in generating executable and interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript code, outperforming their base counterparts across both interactive and static UI2Code benchmarks. Our code and models are available at \href{https://zheny2751-dotcom.github.io/webvia.github.io/}{\texttt{https://webvia.github.io}}.

Among different types of feedback, next-step hint feedback is particularly important, as it provides students with actionable steps to progress towards solving programming tasks. This study investigates how students interact with an AI-driven next-step hint system in an in-IDE learning environment. We gathered and analyzed a dataset from 34 students solving Kotlin tasks, containing detailed hint interaction logs. We applied process mining techniques and identified 16 common interaction scenarios. Semi-structured interviews with 6 students revealed strategies for managing unhelpful hints, such as adapting partial hints or modifying code to generate variations of the same hint. These findings, combined with our publicly available dataset, offer valuable opportunities for future research and provide key insights into student behavior, helping improve hint design for enhanced learning support.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the balance between forward and backward effects of LLMs in software development from developers' perspectives.

Method: Conducted 22 interviews with software practitioners using socio-technical grounded theory for analysis.

Result: Identified impacts of LLMs at multiple levels (individual, team, organization, society) and outlined best practices for adoption.

Conclusion: Offers insights into trade-offs for software practitioners and managers to evaluate the implementation of LLMs effectively.

Abstract: Background: Large Language Models emerged with the potential of provoking a revolution in software development (e.g., automating processes, workforce transformation). Although studies have started to investigate the perceived impact of LLMs for software development, there is a need for empirical studies to comprehend how to balance forward and backward effects of using LLMs. Objective: We investigated how LLMs impact software development and how to manage the impact from a software developer's perspective. Method: We conducted 22 interviews with software practitioners across 3 rounds of data collection and analysis, between October (2024) and September (2025). We employed socio-technical grounded theory (STGT) for data analysis to rigorously analyse interview participants' responses. Results: We identified the benefits (e.g., maintain software development flow, improve developers' mental model, and foster entrepreneurship) and disadvantages (e.g., negative impact on developers' personality and damage to developers' reputation) of using LLMs at individual, team, organisation, and society levels; as well as best practices on how to adopt LLMs. Conclusion: Critically, we present the trade-offs that software practitioners, teams, and organisations face in working with LLMs. Our findings are particularly useful for software team leaders and IT managers to assess the viability of LLMs within their specific context.

*Antu Saha,Mehedi Sun,Oscar Chaparro*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores automated solution identification in software issue discussions using various language model applications, achieving the best results with fine-tuned large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to automate the identification of solution-related content in issue discussions for streamlining software maintenance, issue resolution, and solution reuse, addressing the challenges of manual analysis.

Method: Using a dataset from 356 Mozilla Firefox issues, the authors trained and evaluated multiple models, including traditional machine learning models, pre-trained language models, and large language models, across 68 configurations.

Result: Fine-tuned large language models achieved the highest performance (LLAMAft reaching 0.716 F1 score), with ensemble approaches further improving results (0.737 F1). Misclassifications were attributed to misleading clues or missing context.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs and ensembles are effective for solution identification in issue discussions, supporting cross-project transferability and reducing manual effort in software development.

Abstract: During issue resolution, software developers rely on issue reports to discuss solutions for defects, feature requests, and other changes. These discussions contain proposed solutions-from design changes to code implementations-as well as their evaluations. Locating solution-related content is essential for investigating reopened issues, addressing regressions, reusing solutions, and understanding code change rationale. Manually understanding long discussions to identify such content can be difficult and time-consuming.
  This paper automates solution identification using language models as supervised classifiers. We investigate three applications-embeddings, prompting, and fine-tuning-across three classifier types: traditional ML models (MLMs), pre-trained language models (PLMs), and large language models (LLMs). Using 356 Mozilla Firefox issues, we created a dataset to train and evaluate six MLMs, four PLMs, and two LLMs across 68 configurations.
  Results show that MLMs with LLM embeddings outperform TF-IDF features, prompting underperforms, and fine-tuned LLMs achieve the highest performance, with LLAMAft reaching 0.716 F1 score. Ensembles of the best models further improve results (0.737 F1). Misclassifications often arise from misleading clues or missing context, highlighting the need for context-aware classifiers. Models trained on Mozilla transfer to other projects, with a small amount of project-specific data, further enhancing results. This work supports software maintenance, issue understanding, and solution reuse.

*Mostafijur Rahman Akhond,Saikat Chakraborty,Gias Uddin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer and fix loop invariants, critical for program safety assessment, finding their performance improves significantly with supplemental domain knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing the ability of LLMs in inferring and repairing inductive loop invariants due to their potential in automated program safety assessment.

Method: An empirical study on different types of LLMs, analyzing their proficiency with and without supplementary domain knowledge and examples.

Result: LLMs demonstrated up to 78% success in inferring loop invariants but only 16% in repairing them, showcasing improved results with auxiliary context.

Conclusion: While LLMs show potential for loop invariant tasks, their capabilities can be substantially boosted through additional information and examples, suggesting room for improvement.

Abstract: A loop invariant is a property of a loop that remains true before and after each execution of the loop. The identification of loop invariants is a critical step to support automated program safety assessment. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in diverse software engineering (SE) and formal verification tasks. However, we are not aware of the performance of LLMs to infer loop invariants. We report an empirical study of both open-source and closed-source LLMs of varying sizes to assess their proficiency in inferring inductive loop invariants for programs and in fixing incorrect invariants. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some utility in inferring and repairing loop invariants, their performance is substantially enhanced when supplemented with auxiliary information such as domain knowledge and illustrative examples. LLMs achieve a maximum success rate of 78\% in generating, but are limited to 16\% in repairing the invariant.

*Tapti Palit,Seyedhamed Ghavamnia,Michalis Polychronakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PhaseSeed improves call graph construction accuracy by combining dynamic runtime analysis with static pointer analysis for split-phase applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static pointer analysis lacks precision due to its broad generic design, overlooking application-specific architectures like split-phase systems.

Method: PhaseSeed collects dynamic points-to data during the initialization phase and uses this seeded information for precise static pointer analysis in the processing phase.

Result: PhaseSeed enhances precision by up to 92.6% for CFI and provides better security support, including additional filtering of critical system calls.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic and static analyses via PhaseSeed enhances pointer analysis precision, making it highly effective for security mechanisms like CFI and system call filtering.

Abstract: Precise and sound call graph construction is crucial for many software security mechanisms. Unfortunately, traditional static pointer analysis techniques used to generate application call graphs suffer from imprecision. These techniques are agnostic to the application's architecture and are designed for broad applicability. To mitigate this precision problem, we propose PhaseSeed, a novel technique that improves the accuracy of pointer analysis for split-phase applications, which have distinct initialization and processing phases. PhaseSeed analyzes the initialization phase dynamically, collecting the points-to relationships established at runtime. At the end of the initialization phase, it then seeds this information to a static analysis stage that performs pointer analysis for all code that stays in scope during the processing phase, improving precision. Our observations show that, given the same runtime configuration options, the points-to relationships established during the initialization phase remain constant across multiple runs. Therefore, PhaseSeed is sound with respect to a given initial configuration. We apply PhaseSeed to three security mechanisms: control flow integrity (CFI), software debloating, and system call filtering. PhaseSeed provides up to 92.6% precision improvement for CFI compared to static call graph construction techniques, and filters nine additional security-critical system calls when used to generate Seccomp profiles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of maintaining statistical rigor and error handling in automated research systems using functional programming approaches.

Method: The paper uses a Haskell eDSL, 'Research monad,' combined with declarative scaffolding to enforce structural constraints and mitigate risks in sequential statistical protocols.

Result: The approach was validated through simulations of 2000 hypotheses and a case study, showing robustness in enforcing scientific integrity.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture provides essential defense mechanisms for ensuring statistical rigor and reliability in AI-driven research systems.

Abstract: Sequential statistical protocols require meticulous state management and robust error handling -- challenges naturally suited to functional programming. We present a functional architecture for structural enforcement of statistical rigor in automated research systems (AI-Scientists). These LLM-driven systems risk generating spurious discoveries through dynamic hypothesis testing. We introduce the Research monad, a Haskell eDSL that enforces sequential statistical protocols (e.g., Online FDR (false discovery rate) control) using a monad transformer stack. To address risks in hybrid architectures where LLMs generate imperative code, we employ Declarative Scaffolding -- generating rigid harnesses that structurally constrain execution and prevent methodological errors like data leakage. We validate this approach through large-scale simulation (N=2000 hypotheses) and an end-to-end case study, demonstrating essential defense-in-depth for automated science integrity.

*Rui Lu,Lyuye Zhang,Kaixuan Li,Min Zhang,Yixiang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Open-source software reuse can prevent redundant work but poses challenges in keeping libraries up-to-date due to compatibility and redundancy issues. DepUpdater automates this process more effectively than existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity in keeping open-source software libraries updated, while avoiding incompatibility and redundant dependencies, discourages developers from performing upgrades.

Method: The paper introduces DepUpdater, a tool to ensure optimal upgrades by reducing technical lag, maintaining compatibility, and minimizing redundancy.

Result: DepUpdater outperforms existing tools, reduces technical lag better, ensures compatibility, and avoids redundant dependencies. Ablation studies show pruning improves upgrade effectiveness.

Conclusion: DepUpdater is an automated, effective solution for upgrading OSS libraries, optimizing compatibility and dependency issues while promoting future research on transitive dependency upgrades.

Abstract: Re-using open-source software (OSS) can avoid reinventing the wheel, but failing to keep it up-to-date can lead to missing new features and persistent bugs or vulnerabilities that have already been resolved. The use of outdated OSS libraries introduces technical lag, necessitating timely upgrades. However, maintaining up-to-date libraries is challenging, as it may introduce incompatibility issues that break the project or redundant dependencies that unnecessarily increase the size of the project. These issues discourage developers from upgrading libraries, highlighting the need for a fully automated solution that balances version upgrades, reduces technical lag, ensures compatibility, and avoids redundant dependencies.
  To this end, we propose DepUpdater, which ensures that upgrades minimize technical lag as much as possible while avoiding incompatibility issues and redundant dependencies. The comparison with existing dependency management tools demonstrates that DepUpdater more effectively reduces technical lag while ensuring compatibility and pruning redundant dependencies. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the potential benefits of considering pruning requirements during upgrades to mitigate incompatibility issues. Finally, leveraging DepUpdater, we investigate the impact of transitive dependency upgrades on client compatibility, providing insights for future research.

Motivation: The need for a holistic, data-driven view of team performance and system health in large-scale software development, amidst siloed data and manual reporting inefficiencies.

Method: The proposed system aggregates data from various platforms using cron-based ingestion, dual-schema storage, pre-computation engines for metrics, proactive alerts, and Metabase for visualization, secured via RBAC.

Result: The framework saved 20 person-hours per week in manual reporting efforts and improved bottleneck identification efficiency, while its scalability was assessed along with trade-offs.

Conclusion: This implementation highlights the value of automated, centralized engineering intelligence systems for optimizing software development processes and decision-making.

Abstract: In modern, large-scale software development, engineering leaders face the significant challenge of gaining a holistic and data-driven view of team performance and system health. Data is often siloed across numerous disparate tools, making manual report generation time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a centralized framework designed to provide near-real-time visibility into developer experience (DevEx) and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) metrics for a software ecosystem. By aggregating data from various internal tools and platforms, the system computes and visualizes metrics across key areas such as Developer Productivity, Quality, and Operational Efficiency. The architecture features a cron-based data ingestion layer, a dual-schema data storage approach, a processing engine for metric pre-computation, a proactive alerting system, and utilizes the open-source BI tool Metabase for visualization, all secured with role-based access control (RBAC). The implementation resulted in a significant reduction in manual reporting efforts, saving an estimated 20 person-hours per week, and enabled faster, data-driven bottleneck identification. Finally, we evaluate the system's scalability and discuss its trade-offs, positioning it as a valuable contribution to engineering intelligence platforms.

*Davis Byamugisha,Francis Kamuganga,Adones Rukundo,John Businge*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using software engineering principles, inspired by GitHub version control, to improve collaboration in cancer management, aiming to reduce delays and enhance information sharing among stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cancer treatment often suffers delays due to limited skilled manpower and disorganized information management systems. The authors aim to bridge these gaps by exploring parallels between cancer case management and software engineering practices.

Method: A model guided by GitHub's version control principles was designed to facilitate better information sharing among cancer care groups. Any-Logic simulation software was used to test the model.

Result: The study found that software engineering principles, specifically GitHub bug resolution practices, can effectively improve collaboration, coordination, and information sharing among cancer management stakeholders.

Conclusion: Using software engineering principles in cancer case management has potential to reduce delays, enhance care coordination, facilitate early diagnosis, and improve survival outcomes for patients.

Abstract: Effective treatment of cancer requires early diagnosis which involves the patient's awareness of the early signs and symptoms, leading to a consultation with a health provider, who would then promptly refer the patient for confirmation of the diagnosis and thereafter treatment. However, this is not always the case because of delays arising from limited skilled manpower and health information management systems that are neither integrated nor organized in their design hence leading to information gap among care groups. Existing methods focus on using accumulated data to support decision making, enhancing the sharing of secondary data while others exclude some critical stakeholders like patient caretakers and administrators thus, leaving an information gap that creates delays and miscommunication during case management. We however notice some similarities between cancer treatment and software engineering information management especially when progress history needs to be maintained (versioning).
  We analyze the similarities and propose a model for information sharing among cancer care groups using the software engineering principles approach. We model for reducing delays and improving coordination among care groups in cancer case management. Model design was guided by software engineering principles adopted in GitHub version control system for bug fixing in open-source code projects. Any-Logic simulation software was used to mimic the model realism in a virtual environment. Results show that bug resolution principles from software engineering and GitHub version control system can be adopted to coordinate collaboration and information sharing among care groups in a cancer case management environment while involving all stakeholders to improve care treatment outcomes, ensure early diagnosis and increase patient's survival chances.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ContextCRBench addresses limitations in LLM-based code review benchmarks by providing a fine-grained, high-quality, context-rich dataset for improved evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-driven code review lack semantic context, have data quality issues, and operate at coarse granularity, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The paper presents ContextCRBench, constructed through data crawling, context extraction, and multi-stage filtering for generating a benchmark with enriched entries.

Result: ContextCRBench improves code review performance at ByteDance by 61.98%, supports insightful evaluation scenarios, and reveals current LLMs' limitations compared to human reviewers.

Conclusion: ContextCRBench offers a robust solution for evaluating LLMs in code review, with industrial applicability and significant contributions to software quality assurance.

Abstract: Code review is a cornerstone of software quality assurance, and recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating this process. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations. (1) Lack of semantic context: most benchmarks provide only code diffs without textual information such as issue descriptions, which are crucial for understanding developer intent. (2) Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. (3) Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review.
  We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: (1) Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; (2) Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and (3) Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries.
  ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: (1) hunk-level quality assessment, (2) line-level defect localization, and (3) line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability. Deployed at ByteDance, ContextCRBench drives a self-evolving code review system, improving performance by 61.98% and demonstrating its robustness and industrial utility.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Jupyter notebooks in data science and machine learning workflows has created a gap between exploratory code development and production-ready software systems. While notebooks excel at iterative development and visualization, they often lack proper software engineering principles, making their transition to production environments challenging. This paper presents Codelevate, a novel multi-agent system that automatically transforms Jupyter notebooks into well-structured, maintainable Python code repositories. Our system employs three specialized agents - Architect, Developer, and Structure - working in concert through a shared dependency tree to ensure architectural coherence and code quality. Our experimental results validate Codelevate's capability to bridge the prototype-to-production gap through autonomous code transformation, yielding quantifiable improvements in code quality metrics while preserving computational semantics.

### [616] [Stable non-minimal fixed points of threshold-linear networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05517)
*Jesse Geneson*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper disproves a conjecture about threshold-linear networks (TLNs) by showing that stable fixed points do not necessarily have minimal support, using a 3-neuron counterexample and further general constructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a conjecture by Curto et al. (2024) proposing that in TLNs, all stable fixed points must be minimal fixed points, as this assumption influences theoretical understanding and applications of TLNs.

Method: The authors construct a specific example of a 3-neuron competitive TLN to refute the conjecture, and extend this framework to demonstrate the existence of larger networks with non-minimal stable fixed points and nested chains of stable fixed points.

Result: A competitive TLN with 3 neurons was demonstrated to have stable fixed points with non-minimal supports, and this construction was generalized to show the same is true for arbitrary nested structures.

Conclusion: The conjecture by Curto et al. (2024) is false, as stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can have non-minimal support. The authors provide a specific counterexample and prove that chains of nested stable fixed points can be extended indefinitely.

Abstract: In threshold-linear networks (TLNs), a fixed point is called minimal if no proper subset of its support is also a fixed point. Curto et al (Advances in Applied Mathematics, 2024) conjectured that every stable fixed point of any TLN must be a minimal fixed point. We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: an explicit competitive TLN on 3 neurons that exhibits a stable fixed point whose support is not minimal (it contains the support of another stable fixed point). We prove that there is no competitive TLN on 2 neurons which contains a stable non-minimal fixed point, so our 3-neuron construction is the smallest such example. By expanding our base example, we show for any positive integers $i, j$ with $i < j-1$ that there exists a competitive TLN with stable fixed point supports $τ\subsetneq σ$ for which $|τ| = i$ and $|σ| = j$. Using a different expansion of our base example, we also show that chains of nested stable fixed points in competitive TLNs can be made arbitrarily long.

*Debanjali Bhattacharya,Neelam Sinha*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study introduces persistent homology tools, particularly Betti curves, for predicting brain age and differentiating between normal and pathological aging using structural MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to develop effective methods for understanding structural brain changes in aging and to distinguish normal aging from pathological cognitive decline.

Method: The authors used Betti curve features (via persistent homology analysis) on 100 structural MRI scans from the ADNI dataset, focusing on dimensions capturing connected components and 1D holes.

Result: Betti curve features successfully capture structural alterations in the brain linked to aging, distinguishing between normal and pathological aging, and correlating clinical features with brain or chronological age.

Conclusion: Betti curve analysis provides a promising framework for identifying biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of cognitive impairment, bridging structural changes with cognitive outcomes.

Abstract: In this study, we propose the use of persistent homology -- specifically Betti curves for brain age prediction and for distinguishing between healthy and pathological aging. The proposed framework is applied to 100 structural MRI scans from the publicly available ADNI dataset. Our results indicate that Betti curve features, particularly those from dimension-1 (connected components) and dimension-2 (1D holes), effectively capture structural brain alterations associated with aging. Furthermore, clinical features are grouped into three categories based on their correlation, or lack thereof, with (i) predicted brain age and (ii) chronological age. The findings demonstrate that this approach successfully differentiates normal from pathological aging and provides a novel framework for understanding how structural brain changes relate to cognitive impairment. The proposed method serves as a foundation for developing potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of cognitive decline.

*Aniruddha Saha,Soujanya Hazra,Sanjay Ghosh*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of explainable machine learning methods on fMRI-based brain connectome data to classify individuals with brain disorders. LASSO demonstrated superior accuracy and stability compared to other feature selection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain disorders present challenges for individuals and healthcare systems globally. Identifying effective biomarkers for classification can improve diagnosis and treatment strategies, thus necessitating research in this domain.

Method: The study uses brain connectome data from fMRI scans and employs feature selection techniques like LASSO, Relief, and ANOVA. A logistic regression classifier was applied to assess classification accuracy and stability of selected features.

Result: The LASSO method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74 on the UCLA dataset, outperforming the Relief and ANOVA methods.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of LASSO-based feature selection in identifying reliable biomarkers for connectome-based classification of brain disorders, supporting advancements in the detection and understanding of these conditions.

Abstract: Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual computational model combining EEG data prediction with Gaussian Processes to analyze human adaptation to varying gravitational forces, complemented by simulated subjective experiences using a language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and predict human physiological and cognitive state adaptations under different gravitational conditions using computational modeling.

Method: The framework uses a two-part model: (1) an MLP for EEG frequency band predictions representing cortical states and (2) Gaussian Processes for physiological modeling, trained on parabolic flight data. It also uses a language model to simulate introspective narratives of gravitational experiences.

Result: The computational models quantitatively mapped cortical and physiological states under varying gravitational loads, while the simulated narratives aligned with the quantitative findings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a comprehensive tool to analyze and predict human performance in altered gravity environments by combining physiological and cognitive modeling techniques.

Abstract: Earth's gravity has fundamentally shaped human development by guiding the brain's integration of vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive inputs into an internal model of gravity: a dynamic neural representation enabling prediction and interpretation of gravitational forces. This work presents a dual computational framework to quantitatively model these adaptations. The first component is a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts g-load-dependent changes in key electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands, representing the brain's cortical state. The second component utilizes a suite of independent Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the body's broader physiological state, including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and motor behavior. Both models were trained on data derived from a comprehensive review of parabolic flight literature, using published findings as anchor points to construct robust, continuous functions. To complement this quantitative analysis, we simulated subjective human experience under different gravitational loads, ranging from microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (Moon 0.17g, Mars 0.38g) to hypergravity associated with spacecraft launch and re-entry (1.8g), using a large language model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet). The model was prompted with physiological parameters to generate introspective narratives of alertness and self-awareness, which closely aligned with the quantitative findings from both the EEG and physiological models. This combined framework integrates quantitative physiological modeling with generative cognitive simulation, offering a novel approach to understanding and predicting human performance in altered gravity

*Jeff Brown,Andrew Kirjner Annika Vivekananthan,Ed Boyden*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper investigates the capability of AI systems to perform tasks crucial for connectomics data proofreading, introducing ConnectomeBench as a benchmark and evaluating various LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the demand for automating the labor-intensive process of proofreading connectomics data using advanced AI capabilities.

Method: Researchers employ ConnectomeBench benchmark and multimodal evaluations using expert-annotated data from mouse visual cortex and Drosophila brain datasets, testing both proprietary and open-source AI models.

Result: Current multimodal LLMs achieve promising performance in segment identification and split error correction, though they struggle with merge error detection compared to human experts.

Conclusion: While the best models do not yet match expert-level performance, they demonstrate promising potential to eventually assist or replace human proofreading in connectomics research.

Abstract: Connectomics - the mapping of neural connections in an organism's brain - currently requires extraordinary human effort to proofread the data collected from imaging and machine-learning assisted segmentation. With the growing excitement around using AI agents to automate important scientific tasks, we explore whether current AI systems can perform multiple tasks necessary for data proofreading. We introduce ConnectomeBench, a multimodal benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) capabilities in three critical proofreading tasks: segment type identification, split error correction, and merge error detection. Using expert annotated data from two large open-source datasets - a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex and the complete Drosophila brain - we evaluate proprietary multimodal LLMs including Claude 3.7/4 Sonnet, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, as well as open source models like InternVL-3 and NVLM. Our results demonstrate that current models achieve surprisingly high performance in segment identification (52-82% balanced accuracy vs. 20-25% chance) and binary/multiple choice split error correction (75-85% accuracy vs. 50% chance) while generally struggling on merge error identification tasks. Overall, while the best models still lag behind expert performance, they demonstrate promising capabilities that could eventually enable them to augment and potentially replace human proofreading in connectomics.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This study highlights the underrepresentation of non-Hispanic White populations in neuroimaging studies and examines racial variations in brain network structures, linking them to Alzheimer's Disease and worry levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diversity in neuroimaging studies and assess the impact of racial differences on brain network architecture in relation to Alzheimer’s Disease progression and worry levels.

Method: Used the Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset to construct directed hyper-connectomes based on causal influences between brain regions, identifying connections to cognitive and affective phenotypes across racial groups.

Result: Findings indicate both shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns affecting Alzheimer’s progress and worry levels, along with differences in regulatory feedback networks between populations.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of population-aware neuroimaging models due to significant racial variations in brain network architecture and their influence on cognitive and emotional outcomes.

Abstract: Current neuroimaging studies on neurodegenerative diseases and psychological risk factors have been developed predominantly in non Hispanic White cohorts, with other populations markedly underrepresented. In this work, we construct directed hyper connectomes among large scale functional brain systems based on causal influences between brain regions, and examine their links to Alzheimer Disease progression and worry levels across racial groups. By using Health and Aging Brain Study Health Disparities (HABS HD) dataset, our experimental results suggest that neglecting racial variation in brain network architecture may reduce predictive performance in both cognitive and affective phenotypes. Important shared and population-specific hyper-connectome patterns related to both AD progression and worry levels were identified. We further observed distinct closed loop directed circuits across groups, suggesting that different populations may rely on distinct feedback based network regulation strategies when supporting cognition or managing emotional states. Together, these results indicate a common backbone of network vulnerability with population-dependent variations in regulatory coordination, underscoring the importance of population-aware neuroimaging models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for mathematically precise models to study psychological phenomena and cognitive aspects of AI is highlighted.

Method: Human psychodynamics is formalized via a diagrammatic framework of process theory.

Result: Links between the framework and cognitive analysis are explored with applications in psychotherapy, AI alignment, and neurotechnology.

Conclusion: This framework could facilitate interdisciplinary expertise to address AI safety and improve psychological studies.

Abstract: The complexity of human cognition has meant that psychology makes more use of theory and conceptual models than perhaps any other biomedical field. To enable precise quantitative study of the full breadth of phenomena in psychological and psychiatric medicine as well as cognitive aspects of AI safety, there is a need for a mathematical formulation which is both mathematically precise and equally accessible to experts from numerous fields. In this paper we formalize human psychodynamics via the diagrammatic framework of process theory, describe its key properties, and explain the links between a diagrammatic representation and central concepts in analysis of cognitive processes in contexts such as psychotherapy, neurotechnology, AI alignment, AI agent representation of individuals in autonomous negotiations, developing human-like AI systems, and other aspects of AI safety.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-driven high-density NIRS system that enhances brain cortex oxygenation accuracy using neural networks trained on synthetic MRI datasets. It demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods in simulation, biomimetic experiments, and clinical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has limitations in extracting layer-specific data due to photon scattering, restricting its use in precise neurological monitoring.

Method: The system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets, aiming to provide accurate, real-time cortical oxygenation measurements.

Result: The AI-assisted NIRS system achieved robust cortical oxygenation accuracy (R2=0.913 in simulation; R2=0.986 in experiments) and effectively differentiated ischemic stroke patients from healthy individuals (AUC=0.943).

Conclusion: The AI-driven NIRS system holds significant promise for improving neurological monitoring and diagnosis in emergency and point-of-care environments, providing a more precise and accessible tool for critical care.

Abstract: Photon scattering has traditionally limited the ability of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to extract accurate, layer-specific information from the brain. This limitation restricts its clinical utility for precise neurological monitoring. To address this, we introduce an AI-driven, high-density NIRS system optimized to provide real-time, layer-specific oxygenation data from the brain cortex, specifically targeting acute neuro-emergencies. Our system integrates high-density NIRS reflectance data with a neural network trained on MRI-based synthetic datasets. This approach achieves robust cortical oxygenation accuracy across diverse anatomical variations. In simulations, our AI-assisted NIRS demonstrated a strong correlation (R2=0.913) with actual cortical oxygenation, markedly outperforming conventional methods (R2=0.469). Furthermore, biomimetic phantom experiments confirmed its superior anatomical reliability (R2=0.986) compared to standard commercial devices (R2=0.823). In clinical validation with healthy subjects and ischemic stroke patients, the system distinguished between the two groups with an AUC of 0.943. This highlights its potential as an accessible, high-accuracy diagnostic tool for emergency and point-of-care settings. These results underscore the system's capability to advance neuro-monitoring precision through AI, enabling timely, data-driven decisions in critical care environments.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces BrainCSD, a multimodal foundation model designed to address challenges in brain biomarkers' functional and structural connectivity (FC/SC) synthesis and decoding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are limitations in multimodal brain analysis - costly acquisition, complex preprocessing, and issues with missing modalities. The aim is to enhance clinical utility through robust computational solutions.

Method: BrainCSD employs a hierarchical MoE foundation model with three components: ROI-specific contrastive alignment, dynamic cross-time dependencies modeling, and structural refinement informed by symmetry and network priors.

Result: BrainCSD demonstrates strong performance across various tasks, including achieving 95.6% accuracy in classification tasks, low synthesis errors, and accurate predictions for brain age and MMSE scores.

Conclusion: The proposed BrainCSD model successfully synthesizes multimodal biomarkers and enables effective downstream tasks, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Functional and structural connectivity (FC/SC) are key multimodal biomarkers for brain analysis, yet their clinical utility is hindered by costly acquisition, complex preprocessing, and frequent missing modalities. Existing foundation models either process single modalities or lack explicit mechanisms for cross-modal and cross-scale consistency. We propose BrainCSD, a hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) foundation model that jointly synthesizes FC/SC biomarkers and supports downstream decoding tasks (diagnosis and prediction). BrainCSD features three neuroanatomically grounded components: (1) a ROI-specific MoE that aligns regional activations from canonical networks (e.g., DMN, FPN) with a global atlas via contrastive consistency; (2) a Encoding-Activation MOE that models dynamic cross-time/gradient dependencies in fMRI/dMRI; and (3) a network-aware refinement MoE that enforces structural priors and symmetry at individual and population levels. Evaluated on the datasets under complete and missing-modality settings, BrainCSD achieves SOTA results: 95.6\% accuracy for MCI vs. CN classification without FC, low synthesis error (FC RMSE: 0.038; SC RMSE: 0.006), brain age prediction (MAE: 4.04 years), and MMSE score estimation (MAE: 1.72 points).

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a permutation test to statistically compare functional brain networks, using topological invariance and Wasserstein distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparing functional brain networks statistically is challenging due to their complex topological structures and variability. The authors aim to develop a robust method for detecting topological inequivalence.

Method: The proposed test employs topological invariance principles, $2$-Wasserstein distances for persistent diagrams, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian, and guarantees reduced variance through optimal Hilbert space projection.

Result: Simulations indicate this method outperforms conventional two-sample tests. Application to fMRI data identifies significant network differences between cannabis users and non-users.

Conclusion: This permutation test provides a powerful tool for topological comparisons in brain networks, advancing statistical methods in neuroscience.

Abstract: Functional brain networks exhibit topological structures that reflect neural organization; however, statistical comparison of these networks is challenging for several reasons. This paper introduces a topologically invariant permutation test for detecting topological inequivalence. Under topological equivalence, topological features can be permuted separately between groups without distorting individual network structures. The test statistic uses $2$-Wasserstein distances on persistent diagrams, computed in closed form. To reduce variability in brain connectivities while preserving topology, heat kernel expansion on the Hodge Laplacian is applied with bandwidth $t$ controlling diffusion intensity. Theoretical results guarantee variance reduction through optimal Hilbert space projection. Simulations across diverse network topologies show superior performance compared to conventional two-sample tests and alternative metrics. Applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD study, the method detects significant topological differences between cannabis users and non-users.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores neural behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing similarities with the human brain's grammatical processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs like Llama 3 process grammatical categories akin to human brains and to enhance understanding of their functionality.

Method: The study identifies key neurons in Llama 3 that predict words belonging to different parts-of-speech tags and trains a classifier to analyze neuron activation patterns.

Result: Activation patterns of identified neurons reliably predict part-of-speech tags, revealing a specialized subspace for grammatical processing in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs have neuron activation patterns similar to brain processing, pointing to a conceptual subspace for grammatical understanding.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks, the building blocks of AI, were inspired by the human brain's network of neurons. Over the years, these networks have evolved to replicate the complex capabilities of the brain, allowing them to handle tasks such as image and language processing. In the realm of Large Language Models, there has been a keen interest in making the language learning process more akin to that of humans. While neuroscientific research has shown that different grammatical categories are processed by different neurons in the brain, we show that LLMs operate in a similar way. Utilizing Llama 3, we identify the most important neurons associated with the prediction of words belonging to different part-of-speech tags. Using the achieved knowledge, we train a classifier on a dataset, which shows that the activation patterns of these key neurons can reliably predict part-of-speech tags on fresh data. The results suggest the presence of a subspace in LLMs focused on capturing part-of-speech tag concepts, resembling patterns observed in lesion studies of the brain in neuroscience.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the causal relationship between neural spikes and population waves in neuroscience, providing a formal framework based on Pearl's do-calculus to clarify epiphenomenality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether collective neural waves causally influence behavior or are mere reflections of spiking dynamics in neural activity.

Method: A formal framework based on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and Pearl's do-calculus is developed, focusing on the invariance of interventional distributions to define epiphenomenality.

Result: Derived a certificate of sufficiency for causal explainability, clarifying conditions for interpreting interventions within spike-wave duality models.

Conclusion: Rather than resolving the spike-wave debate, the paper reformulates it to focus on the conditions for proving the causal significance of neural signals, separating prediction from explanation.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior is a central goal of neuroscience. Despite significant advances, a fundamental dichotomy persists: neural activity manifests as both discrete spikes of individual neurons and collective waves of populations. Both neural codes correlate with behavior, yet correlation alone cannot determine whether waves exert a causal influence or merely reflect spiking dynamics without causal efficacy. According to the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, no amount of observational data--however extensive--can settle this question; causal conclusions require explicit structural assumptions or careful experiment designs that directly correspond to the causal effect of interest. We develop a formal framework that makes this limitation precise and constructive. Formalizing epiphenomenality via the invariance of interventional distributions in Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we derive a certificate of sufficiency from Pearl's do-calculus that specifies when variables can be removed from the model without loss of causal explainability and clarifies how interventions should be interpreted under different causal structures of spike-wave duality. The purpose of this work is not to resolve the spike-wave debate, but to reformulate it. We shift the problem from asking which signal matters most to asking under what conditions any signal can be shown to matter at all. This reframing distinguishes prediction from explanation and offers neuroscience a principled route for deciding when waves belong to mechanism and when they constitute a byproduct of underlying coordination

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional connectivity analysis is crucial for understanding brain diseases, cognition, and behavior through fMRI. Improvements are needed to distill meaningful information for clinical and experimental use.

Method: The authors use Mahalanobis data whitening prior to dimensionality reduction algorithms and interpret it through the Bures distance framework related to quantum mechanics.

Result: Mahalanobis whitening successfully extracts valuable information about subjects and stimuli from fMRI data, aiding insights into brain functions.

Conclusion: The approach could improve discoveries in neuroscience and benefit early-stage Alzheimer's diagnostics by enhancing accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Functional connectivity has been widely investigated to understand brain disease in clinical studies and imaging-based neuroscience, and analyzing changes in functional connectivity has proven to be valuable for understanding and computationally evaluating the effects on brain function caused by diseases or experimental stimuli. By using Mahalanobis data whitening prior to the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, we are able to distill meaningful information from fMRI signals about subjects and the experimental stimuli used to prompt them. Furthermore, we offer an interpretation of Mahalanobis whitening as a two-stage de-individualization of data which is motivated by similarity as captured by the Bures distance, which is connected to quantum mechanics. These methods have potential to aid discoveries about the mechanisms that link brain function with cognition and behavior and may improve the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis, especially in the preclinical stage of disease progression.

TL;DR: The study proposes a lightweight framework to examine dynamic brain connectivity through Time Varying Directed Transfer Function (TV DTF) validated using Machine Learning-based stress classification models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stress plays a critical role in mental health and understanding its neural mechanisms is essential. Electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis combined with AI provides promising tools for investigating these dynamics.

Method: TV DTF was utilized to measure directional information flow between brain regions over EEG data from SAM 40 dataset, focusing on mental arithmetic tasks. Machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost were used for feature validation and stress classification.

Result: Alpha-TV-DTF features achieved high accuracy in classification tasks, with SVM reaching 89.73% in 3-class classification and XGBoost at 93.69% for 2-class classification. Dynamic measures outperformed static ones.

Conclusion: The lightweight TV-DTF framework successfully captured spatiotemporal dynamics related to stress, emphasizing the role of frontal regions and demonstrating its potential in brain connectivity research.

Abstract: In recent years, Electroencephalographic analysis has gained prominence in stress research when combined with AI and Machine Learning models for validation. In this study, a lightweight dynamic brain connectivity framework based on Time Varying Directed Transfer Function is proposed, where TV DTF features were validated through ML based stress classification. TV DTF estimates the directional information flow between brain regions across distinct EEG frequency bands, thereby capturing temporal and causal influences that are often overlooked by static functional connectivity measures. EEG recordings from the 32 channel SAM 40 dataset were employed, focusing on mental arithmetic task trials. The dynamic EEG-based TV-DTF features were validated through ML classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Experimental results show that alpha-TV-DTF provided the strongest discriminative power, with SVM achieving 89.73% accuracy in 3-class classification and with XGBoost achieving 93.69% accuracy in 2 class classification. Relative to absolute power and phase locking based functional connectivity features, alpha TV DTF and beta TV DTF achieved higher performance across the ML models, highlighting the advantages of dynamic over static measures. Feature importance analysis further highlighted dominant long-range frontal parietal and frontal occipital informational influences, emphasizing the regulatory role of frontal regions under stress. These findings validate the lightweight TV-DTF as a robust framework, revealing spatiotemporal brain dynamics and directional influences across different stress levels.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks 26 internal validity indexes for clustering, using an improved methodology and a large number of datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering validation indexes are vital for selecting optimal clustering solutions, but existing methodologies have limitations.

Method: The study revises Vendramin et al.'s methodology and proposes three complementary evaluation sub-methodologies, examining 26 indexes across 16177 datasets.

Result: The study offers a detailed assessment of internal validity indexes and their performance across diverse clustering scenarios.

Conclusion: Enhanced methodologies and large data sampling improve understanding of internal indexes, highlighting their utility in clustering evaluation.

Abstract: Validation plays a crucial role in the clustering process. Many different
internal validity indexes exist for the purpose of determining the best
clustering solution(s) from a given collection of candidates, e.g., as produced
by different algorithms or different algorithm hyper-parameters. In this study,
we present a comprehensive benchmark study of 26 internal validity indexes,
which includes highly popular classic indexes as well as more recently
developed ones. We adopted an enhanced revision of the methodology presented in
Vendramin et al. (2010), developed here to address several shortcomings of this
previous work. This overall new approach consists of three complementary
custom-tailored evaluation sub-methodologies, each of which has been designed
to assess specific aspects of an index's behaviour while preventing potential
biases of the other sub-methodologies. Each sub-methodology features two
complementary measures of performance, alongside mechanisms that allow for an
in-depth investigation of more complex behaviours of the internal validity
indexes under study. Additionally, a new collection of 16177 datasets has been
produced, paired with eight widely-used clustering algorithms, for a wider
applicability scope and representation of more diverse clustering scenarios.

*Byoungwoo Park,Juho Lee,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Functional Adjoint Sampler (FAS), designed for sampling Gibbs-type distributions in infinite-dimensional spaces, achieving improved performance in transition path sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theory and algorithms tailored for sampling in infinite-dimensional function spaces, despite their importance in modeling trajectories of diffusion processes with rare events or constraints.

Method: The paper presents FAS, based on stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory, using the stochastic maximum principle for constructing a scalable functional representation for adjoint sampling in Hilbert spaces.

Result: FAS outperforms existing methods in transition path sampling for synthetic and molecular systems such as Alanine Dipeptide and Chignolin.

Conclusion: The Functional Adjoint Sampler simplifies and enhances sampling capabilities in infinite-dimensional spaces, setting a precedent for improved modeling and simulation of complex systems.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for sampling from the Gibbs distribution in finite-dimensional spaces have progressed quickly, yet theory and algorithmic design for infinite-dimensional function spaces remain limited. This gap persists despite their strong potential for sampling the paths of conditional diffusion processes, enabling efficient simulation of trajectories of diffusion processes that respect rare events or boundary constraints. In this work, we present the adjoint sampler for infinite-dimensional function spaces, a stochastic optimal control-based diffusion sampler that operates in function space and targets Gibbs-type distributions on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our Functional Adjoint Sampler (FAS) generalizes Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to Hilbert spaces based on a SOC theory called stochastic maximum principle, yielding a simple and scalable matching-type objective for a functional representation. We show that FAS achieves superior transition path sampling performance across synthetic potential and real molecular systems, including Alanine Dipeptide and Chignolin.

### [633] [Fast Riemannian-manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for hierarchical Gaussian-process models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06407)
*Takashi Hayakawa,Satoshi Asai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study improves Riemannian-manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) for better inference in hierarchical Bayesian models using Gaussian processes, demonstrating better sampling and evidence calculation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of effective Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in hierarchical Bayesian models involving Gaussian processes, beyond simple cases.

Method: The authors optimize RMHMC by adjusting computation order and dynamically programming eigendecomposition, avoiding limitations of naive automatic differentiators.

Result: RMHMC is shown to effectively sample posteriors and calculate model evidence in simulations and real-world data, outperforming existing libraries.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the potential of RMHMC for analyzing real-world data and recommend developing customizable libraries for dynamic programming and optimized automatic differentiation tailored to model structures.

Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes are considered useful for describing complex nonlinear statistical dependencies among variables in real-world data. However, effective Monte Carlo algorithms for inference with these models have not yet been established, except for several simple cases. In this study, we show that, compared with the slow inference achieved with existing program libraries, the performance of Riemannian-manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) can be drastically improved by optimising the computation order according to the model structure and dynamically programming the eigendecomposition. This improvement cannot be achieved when using an existing library based on a naive automatic differentiator. We numerically demonstrate that RMHMC effectively samples from the posterior, allowing the calculation of model evidence, in a Bayesian logistic regression on simulated data and in the estimation of propensity functions for the American national medical expenditure data using several Bayesian multiple-kernel models. These results lay a foundation for implementing effective Monte Carlo algorithms for analysing real-world data with Gaussian processes, and highlight the need to develop a customisable library set that allows users to incorporate dynamically programmed objects and finely optimises the mode of automatic differentiation depending on the model structure.

*Brian B. Avants,Nicholas J. Tustison,James R Stone*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: NSA-Flow is a novel matrix estimation framework that enhances interpretability in high-dimensional machine learning tasks through structured sparsity and smooth optimization near the Stiefel manifold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable representation learning in high-dimensional data (e.g., neuroimaging, genomics) remains challenging, as current methods cannot effectively balance interpretability and flexibility.

Method: NSA-Flow introduces a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and decorrelation with structured sparsity. It operates as a flow near the Stiefel manifold using proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control.

Result: Empirical validation on biomedical datasets such as Golub leukemia and Alzheimer's disease shows NSA-Flow improves performance while maintaining interpretability and scalability.

Conclusion: NSA-Flow is a scalable and general-purpose tool that supports interpretable machine learning across various data domains, demonstrating improved interpretability and generalization.

Abstract: Interpretable representation learning is a central challenge in modern machine learning, particularly in high-dimensional settings such as neuroimaging, genomics, and text analysis. Current methods often struggle to balance the competing demands of interpretability and model flexibility, limiting their effectiveness in extracting meaningful insights from complex data. We introduce Non-negative Stiefel Approximating Flow (NSA-Flow), a general-purpose matrix estimation framework that unifies ideas from sparse matrix factorization, orthogonalization, and constrained manifold learning. NSA-Flow enforces structured sparsity through a continuous balance between reconstruction fidelity and column-wise decorrelation, parameterized by a single tunable weight. The method operates as a smooth flow near the Stiefel manifold with proximal updates for non-negativity and adaptive gradient control, yielding representations that are simultaneously sparse, stable, and interpretable. Unlike classical regularization schemes, NSA-Flow provides an intuitive geometric mechanism for manipulating sparsity at the level of global structure while simplifying latent features. We demonstrate that the NSA-Flow objective can be optimized smoothly and integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines for dimensionality reduction while improving interpretability and generalization in both simulated and real biomedical data. Empirical validation on the Golub leukemia dataset and in Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the NSA-Flow constraints can maintain or improve performance over related methods with little additional methodological effort. NSA-Flow offers a scalable, general-purpose tool for interpretable ML, applicable across data science domains.

*Muhammad Shahnawaz,Adeel Safder*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses supply chain challenges in the UK automotive industry by proposing a framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization, achieving notable cost reductions but highlighting limitations during sudden demand shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address supply chain disruptions and volatile demand, particularly in the JIT-reliant UK automotive industry, by integrating AI with traditional optimization methods.

Method: The authors introduce a stochastic learning-optimization framework combining Bayesian inference and inventory optimization. A two-echelon inventory system is modeled, comparing traditional policies and adaptive Bayesian updating.

Result: Simulations reveal that the approach achieves a 7.4% cost reduction in stable environments and a 5.7% improvement during supply disruptions, but shows limitations in demand shocks due to Bayesian conservatism.

Conclusion: The paper validates practitioner observations mathematically and sets a framework for AI-driven supply chain resilience, while noting critical conditions for effective implementation.

Abstract: Supply chain disruptions and volatile demand pose significant challenges to the UK automotive industry, which relies heavily on Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing. While qualitative studies highlight the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with traditional optimization, a formal, quantitative demonstration of this synergy is lacking. This paper introduces a novel stochastic learning-optimization framework that integrates Bayesian inference with inventory optimization for supply chain management (SCM). We model a two-echelon inventory system subject to stochastic demand and supply disruptions, comparing a traditional static optimization policy against an adaptive policy where Bayesian learning continuously updates parameter estimates to inform stochastic optimization. Our simulations over 365 periods across three operational scenarios demonstrate that the integrated approach achieves 7.4\% cost reduction in stable environments and 5.7\% improvement during supply disruptions, while revealing important limitations during sudden demand shocks due to the inherent conservatism of Bayesian updating. This work provides mathematical validation for practitioner observations and establishes a formal framework for understanding AI-driven supply chain resilience, while identifying critical boundary conditions for successful implementation.

### [636] [Adaptive Testing for Segmenting Watermarked Texts From Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06645)
*Xingchi Li,Xiaochi Liu,Guanxun Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generalized method for detecting and segmenting LLM-generated text using adaptive watermark techniques, aiming to enhance accuracy and robustness without relying on prompt estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of LLMs has raised concerns about misinformation and misuse, necessitating reliable methods to identify LLM-generated text, especially in mixed-content scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a generalized likelihood-based detection method with a weighted formulation and inverse transform sampling, and extend it to segment watermarked and non-watermarked text without relying on precise prompt estimation.

Result: Numerical experiments show that the proposed framework effectively and robustly segments text mixtures of watermarked and non-watermarked content.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive detection methodology provides a reliable and efficient solution to identify and segment watermarked text, addressing the shortcomings of previous techniques.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, underscores the need to distinguish LLM-generated text from human-written content to mitigate the spread of misinformation and misuse in education. One promising approach to address this issue is the watermark technique, which embeds subtle statistical signals into LLM-generated text to enable reliable identification. In this paper, we first generalize the likelihood-based LLM detection method of a previous study by introducing a flexible weighted formulation, and further adapt this approach to the inverse transform sampling method. Moving beyond watermark detection, we extend this adaptive detection strategy to tackle the more challenging problem of segmenting a given text into watermarked and non-watermarked substrings. In contrast to the approach in a previous study, which relies on accurate estimation of next-token probabilities that are highly sensitive to prompt estimation, our proposed framework removes the need for precise prompt estimation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology is both effective and robust in accurately segmenting texts containing a mixture of watermarked and non-watermarked content.

*Jing Shang,James Bannon,Benjamin Haibe-Kains,Robert Tibshirani*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified framework combining random forests with adaptive Lasso weighting, demonstrating theoretical and empirical performance advantages over standard random forests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation in random forests enhanced by Lasso weighting, especially under varying signal-to-noise ratios.

Method: Develops adaptive weighting to integrate Lasso selection with random forests and mathematically evaluates its advantage.

Result: The proposed method outperforms standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, verified through simulations and real-world dataset applications.

Conclusion: Adaptive combination of random forests and Lasso weighting delivers superior performance, with versatile applicability across datasets.

Abstract: Random forests are a statistical learning technique that use bootstrap aggregation to average high-variance and low-bias trees. Improvements to random forests, such as applying Lasso regression to the tree predictions, have been proposed in order to reduce model bias. However, these changes can sometimes degrade performance (e.g., an increase in mean squared error). In this paper, we show in theory that the relative performance of these two methods, standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio. We further propose a unified framework to combine random forests and Lasso selection by applying adaptive weighting and show mathematically that it can strictly outperform the other two methods. We compare the three methods through simulation, including bias-variance decomposition, error estimates evaluation, and variable importance analysis. We also show the versatility of our method by applications to a variety of real-world datasets.

*Tuan Minh Ha,Binh Thanh Nguyen,Lam Si Tung Ho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper develops two simulation-based methods for optimal sampling in dynamical systems without relying on initial parameter estimates, demonstrating their superiority over classical methods through simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical Fisher information matrix-based sampling methods, which depend on initial parameter estimates and can yield suboptimal results.

Method: The paper introduces two new methods: E-optimal-ranking (EOR) using the E-optimal criterion and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for optimal sampling design.

Result: The proposed methods were tested on the Lotka-Volterra and three-compartment models, where they performed better than random sampling and classical E-optimal methods.

Conclusion: The study provides more reliable and effective tools for optimal sampling in systems biology, overcoming the dependency on initial parameter estimates of classical approaches.

Abstract: In many areas of systems biology, including virology, pharmacokinetics, and population biology, dynamical systems are commonly used to describe biological processes. These systems can be characterized by estimating their parameters from sampled data. The key problem is how to optimally select sampling points to achieve accurate parameter estimation. Classical approaches often rely on Fisher information matrix-based criteria such as A-, D-, and E-optimality, which require an initial parameter estimate and may yield suboptimal results when the estimate is inaccurate. This study proposes two simulation-based methods for optimal sampling design that do not depend on initial parameter estimates. The first method, E-optimal-ranking (EOR), employs the E-optimal criterion, while the second utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Simulation studies based on the Lotka-Volterra and three-compartment models demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform both random selection and classical E-optimal design.

*Anay Mehrotra,Grigoris Velegkas,Xifan Yu,Felix Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores language generation under adversarial and noisy conditions, determines robustness to data contamination, and introduces a curriculum learning-inspired model for dense generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse in language generation algorithms and explore the impact of data contamination on generation capabilities.

Method: Investigates generation and dense generation under contaminated enumerations and proposes new models to handle noisy scenarios, inspired by curriculum learning.

Result: Characterizes when generation is achievable under contamination, shows dense generation is more sensitive to contamination, and resolves a prior open question on noisy data generation.

Conclusion: Dense generation is feasible with proper handling of contamination, particularly through curriculum learning, underscoring its importance for noisy data settings.

Abstract: We study language generation in the limit, where an algorithm observes an adversarial enumeration of strings from an unknown target language $K$ and must eventually generate new, unseen strings from $K$. Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] proved that generation is achievable in surprisingly general settings. But their generator suffers from ``mode collapse,'' producing from an ever-smaller subset of the target. To address this, Kleinberg and Wei [KW25] require the generator's output to be ``dense'' in the target language. They showed that generation with density, surprisingly, remains achievable at the same generality.
  Both results assume perfect data: no noisy insertions and no omissions. This raises a central question: how much contamination can generation tolerate? Recent works made partial progress on this question by studying (non-dense) generation with either finite amounts of noise (but no omissions) or omissions (but no noise).
  We characterize robustness under contaminated enumerations: 1. Generation under Contamination: Language generation in the limit is achievable for all countable collections iff the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. When this fails, we characterize which collections are generable. 2. Dense Generation under Contamination: Dense generation is strictly less robust to contamination than generation. As a byproduct, we resolve an open question of Raman and Raman [ICML25] by showing that generation is possible with only membership oracle access under finitely many contaminated examples.
  Finally, we introduce a beyond-worst-case model inspired by curriculum learning and prove that dense generation is achievable even with infinite contamination provided the fraction of contaminated examples converges to zero. This suggests curriculum learning may be crucial for learning from noisy web data.

### [640] [Efficient Dynamic MaxFlow Computation on GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05895)
*Shruthi Kannappan,Ashwina Kumar,Rupesh Nasre*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper proposes two GPU-based Push-Relabel algorithms for efficiently calculating Maxflow on dynamic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing amount of unstructured and semi-structured data, combined with the computational complexity of Maxflow and the dynamic nature of real-world graphs, necessitates the development of faster and more efficient algorithms.

Method: The study introduces two Push-Relabel based algorithms designed to handle dynamic updates (both increments and decrements in edge capacities) in batches on GPUs.

Result: The proposed algorithms demonstrate significant improvements in processing small updates on dynamic graphs compared to conventional static GPU-based Maxflow methods.

Conclusion: The algorithms provide a practical and efficient solution to compute Maxflow for dynamic graphs, with marked performance advantages for small updates.

Abstract: Maxflow is a fundamental problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimisation, used to determine the maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a flow network. It finds applications in diverse domains, including computer networks, transportation, and image segmentation. The core idea is to maximise the total flow across the network without violating capacity constraints on edges and ensuring flow conservation at intermediate nodes. The rapid growth of unstructured and semi-structured data has motivated the development of parallel solutions to compute MaxFlow. However, due to the higher computational complexity, computing Maxflow for real-world graphs is time-consuming in practice. In addition, these graphs are dynamic and constantly evolve over time. In this work, we propose two Push-Relabel based algorithms for processing dynamic graphs on GPUs. The key novelty of our algorithms is their ability to efficiently handle both increments and decrements in edge capacities together when they appear in a batch. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithms with a suite of real-world graphs. Overall, we find that for small updates, dynamic recomputation is significantly faster than a static GPU-based Maxflow.

*Hanlin Cai,Houtianfu Wang,Haofan Dong,Kai Li,Ozgur B. Akan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in federated learning within the Internet of Agents (IoA) by introducing a graph representation-based model poisoning attack that targets large language model systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of FL-enabled IoA systems to advanced model poisoning attacks, particularly under challenging conditions like large-scale models and heterogeneous data scenarios.

Method: The method involves introducing a novel graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack that creates malicious local models using parameter correlation graphs and adversarial variational graph autoencoders to bypass detection.

Result: The experiments reveal that the GRMP attack leads to a significant drop in system accuracy and renders current defense mechanisms ineffective.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical security risks posed by GRMP attacks in the IoA paradigm, emphasizing the need for developing more robust defenses against such threats in large-scale distributed AI systems.

Abstract: Internet of Agents (IoA) envisions a unified, agent-centric paradigm where heterogeneous large language model (LLM) agents can interconnect and collaborate at scale. Within this paradigm, federated learning (FL) serves as a key enabler that allows distributed LLM agents to co-train global models without centralizing data. However, the FL-enabled IoA system remains vulnerable to model poisoning attacks, and the prevailing distance and similarity-based defenses become fragile at billion-parameter scale and under heterogeneous data distributions. This paper proposes a graph representation-based model poisoning (GRMP) attack, which passively exploits observed benign local models to construct a parameter correlation graph and extends an adversarial variational graph autoencoder to capture and reshape higher-order dependencies. The GRMP attack synthesizes malicious local models that preserve benign-like statistics while embedding adversarial objectives, remaining elusive to detection at the server. Experiments demonstrate a gradual drop in system accuracy under the proposed attack and the ineffectiveness of the prevailing defense mechanism in detecting the attack, underscoring a severe threat to the ambitious IoA paradigm.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) using EEG-based graph deep learning, proposing a method called ExPANet for accurate and explainable screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression significantly impacts mental health globally and influences suicide rates. Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical for intervention. EEG presents a promising technique for non-invasive examination of brain activity.

Method: The study introduces a graph-based deep learning framework, ExPANet, which uses EEG data preprocessed into short segments, extracts features such as time and frequency domains, constructs brain graphs using phase-locking value (PLV), and applies a graph attention network to analyze functional connectivity and electrode characteristics.

Result: The ExPANet framework outperforms existing EEG-based approaches on two different datasets. It achieves reliable classification of MDD patients and highlights clinically significant features, cerebral areas, and connectivities.

Conclusion: This method offers an explainable and high-performing solution for MDD screening via EEG-based deep learning, with results aligning with clinical data and aiding in understanding the neural underpinnings of depression.

Abstract: Depression is a major cause of global mental illness and significantly influences suicide rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive and accessible method for examining cerebral activity and identifying disease-associated patterns. We propose a novel graph-based deep learning framework, named Edge-gated, axis-mixed Pooling Attention Network (ExPANet), for differentiating major depressive disorder (MDD) patients from healthy controls (HC). EEG recordings undergo preprocessing to eliminate artifacts and are segmented into short periods of activity. We extract 14 features from each segment, which include time, frequency, fractal, and complexity domains. Electrodes are represented as nodes, whereas edges are determined by the phase-locking value (PLV) to represent functional connectivity. The generated brain graphs are examined utilizing an adapted graph attention network. This architecture acquires both localized electrode characteristics and comprehensive functional connectivity patterns. The proposed framework attains superior performance relative to current EEG-based approaches across two different datasets. A fundamental advantage of our methodology is its explainability. We evaluated the significance of features, channels, and edges, in addition to intrinsic attention weights. These studies highlight features, cerebral areas, and connectivity associations that are especially relevant to MDD, many of which correspond with clinical data. Our findings demonstrate a reliable and transparent method for EEG-based screening of MDD, using deep learning with clinically relevant results.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the integration of multimodal sensing and robotic interventions for Parkinson's disease management, proposing a closed-loop AI-driven framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disconnect between sensing technologies and robotic interventions in Parkinson's disease research and create a unified approach for patient-centered care.

Method: A closed-loop system integrating multimodal sensing, AI models (LLMs, reinforcement learning, etc.), and robotic platforms for personalized intervention and care.

Result: The proposed framework facilitates personalized and context-aware PD management, using AI-driven digital twin technology to adapt interventions over time.

Conclusion: Unifying multimodal sensing and robotic interventions through advanced AI enables intelligent and adaptive Parkinson's disease care, bridging two traditionally separate research fields.

Abstract: The current body of research on Parkinson's disease (PD) screening, monitoring, and management has evolved along two largely independent trajectories. The first research community focuses on multimodal sensing of PD-related biomarkers using noninvasive technologies such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), force/pressure insoles, electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), speech and acoustic analysis, and RGB/RGB-D motion capture systems. These studies emphasize data acquisition, feature extraction, and machine learning-based classification for PD screening, diagnosis, and disease progression modeling. In parallel, a second research community has concentrated on robotic intervention and rehabilitation, employing socially assistive robots (SARs), robot-assisted rehabilitation (RAR) systems, and virtual reality (VR)-integrated robotic platforms for improving motor and cognitive function, enhancing social engagement, and supporting caregivers. Despite the complementary goals of these two domains, their methodological and technological integration remains limited, with minimal data-level or decision-level coupling between the two. With the advent of advanced artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, a unique opportunity now exists to unify these research streams. We envision a closed-loop sensor-AI-robot framework in which multimodal sensing continuously guides the interaction between the patient, caregiver, humanoid robot (and physician) through AI agents that are powered by a multitude of AI models such as robotic and wearables foundation models, LLM-based reasoning, reinforcement learning, and continual learning. Such closed-loop system enables personalized, explainable, and context-aware intervention, forming the basis for digital twin of the PD patient that can adapt over time to deliver intelligent, patient-centered PD care.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for fast and accurate radio-map estimation, outperforming traditional methods in error rate and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in real-time wireless network simulation and dynamic channel modeling, which traditional approaches such as ray tracing struggle with due to computational demands.

Method: The authors propose AIRMap, a U-Net autoencoder that predicts path gains using a 2D elevation map. They also develop an extensive dataset and leverage transfer learning for calibration based on field measurements.

Result: AIRMap achieves path gain predictions with under 5 dB RMSE and performs over 7000x faster than traditional ray tracing methods. With transfer learning, the error reduces to around 10% compared to the 50% error of traditional simulators.

Conclusion: AIRMap is validated for its scalability, high accuracy, and real-time capability in radio-map estimation, making it highly suitable for wireless digital twins and network simulators.

Abstract: Accurate, low-latency channel modeling is essential for real-time wireless network simulation and digital-twin applications. Traditional modeling methods like ray tracing are however computationally demanding and unsuited to model dynamic conditions. In this paper, we propose AIRMap, a deep-learning framework for ultra-fast radio-map estimation, along with an automated pipeline for creating the largest radio-map dataset to date. AIRMap uses a single-input U-Net autoencoder that processes only a 2D elevation map of terrain and building heights. Trained and evaluated on 60,000 Boston-area samples, spanning coverage areas from 500 m to 3 km per side, AIRMap predicts path gain with under 5 dB RMSE in 4 ms per inference on an NVIDIA L40S -over 7000x faster than GPU-accelerated ray tracing based radio maps. A lightweight transfer learning calibration using just 20% of field measurements reduces the median error to approximately 10%, significantly outperforming traditional simulators, which exceed 50% error. Integration into the Colosseum emulator and the Sionna SYS platform demonstrate near-zero error in spectral efficiency and block-error rate compared to measurement-based channels. These findings validate AIRMap's potential for scalable, accurate, and real-time radio map estimation in wireless digital twins.

*Daniel Chenyu Lin,Michael Freeman,John Thickstun*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Current evaluation metrics for Music Language Models fail to measure the correctness of responses. The paper proposes a tailored evaluation metric for the music domain and a factual evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Music Language Models reportedly improve multimodal representations for answering natural language queries about musical audio, but current evaluations primarily assess linguistic fluency, not factual correctness.

Method: The authors propose a general-purpose evaluation metric specific to the music domain and a factual correctness framework to improve the evaluation of Music LMs.

Result: The framework efficiently quantifies correctness, extends to other domains, and uses open datasets. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the limitations in current Music LM evaluation methods and suggests solutions that improve metrics for assessing the accuracy and factuality of model responses.

Abstract: Music language models (Music LMs), like vision language models, leverage multimodal representations to answer natural language queries about musical audio recordings. Although Music LMs are reportedly improving, we find that current evaluations fail to capture whether their answers are correct. Specifically, for all Music LMs that we examine, widely-used evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and BERTScore fail to measure anything beyond linguistic fluency of the model's responses. To measure the true performance of Music LMs, we propose (1) a better general-purpose evaluation metric for Music LMs adapted to the music domain and (2) a factual evaluation framework to quantify the correctness of a Music LM's responses. Our framework is agnostic to the modality of the question-answering model and could be generalized to quantify performance in other open-ended question-answering domains. We use open datasets in our experiments and will release all code on publication.

Result: The proposed method achieved the best ROC-AUC (0.795) performance on real-world polyphonic Persian music, demonstrating its effectiveness in tonal and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Culturally grounded data augmentation enhances Persian instrument recognition, providing a solid basis for inclusive music information retrieval (MIR) and supporting diverse music generation systems.

Abstract: Musical instrument classification is essential for music information retrieval (MIR) and generative music systems. However, research on non-Western traditions, particularly Persian music, remains limited. We address this gap by introducing a new dataset of isolated recordings covering seven traditional Persian instruments, two common but originally non-Persian instruments (i.e., violin, piano), and vocals. We propose a culturally informed data augmentation strategy that generates realistic polyphonic mixtures from monophonic samples. Using the MERT model (Music undERstanding with large-scale self-supervised Training) with a classification head, we evaluate our approach with out-of-distribution data which was obtained by manually labeling segments of traditional songs. On real-world polyphonic Persian music, the proposed method yielded the best ROC-AUC (0.795), highlighting complementary benefits of tonal and temporal coherence. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of culturally grounded augmentation for robust Persian instrument recognition and provide a foundation for culturally inclusive MIR and diverse music generation systems.

*Wenxuan Wu,Shuai Wang,Xixin Wu,Helen Meng,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces ELEGANCE, a framework that integrates linguistic knowledge from LLMs into audio-visual target speaker extraction models, significantly improving extraction under various challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV-TSE models primarily depend on visual cues but humans use linguistic knowledge for speech extraction. The paper aims to enhance AV-TSE models by incorporating this linguistic knowledge.

Method: ELEGANCE combines linguistic guidance using LLMs through three strategies: output linguistic constraints, intermediate linguistic prediction, and input linguistic prior within AV-TSE models.

Result: By utilizing RoBERTa and Qwen models with AV-TSE backbones, the proposed method significantly enhances performance in scenarios like visual impairments, language diversity, speaker switches, and out-of-domain tests.

Conclusion: Integrating linguistic knowledge from LLMs improves the robustness and accuracy of AV-TSE models, especially in challenging scenarios, highlighting the potential of incorporating linguistic guidance in speech extraction.

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on visual cues from the target speaker. However, humans also leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntactic constraints, next word prediction, and prior knowledge of conversation, to extract target speech. Inspired by this observation, we propose ELEGANCE, a novel framework that incorporates linguistic knowledge from large language models (LLMs) into AV-TSE models through three distinct guidance strategies: output linguistic constraints, intermediate linguistic prediction, and input linguistic prior. Comprehensive experiments with RoBERTa, Qwen3-0.6B, and Qwen3-4B on two AV-TSE backbones demon- strate the effectiveness of our approach. Significant improvements are observed in challenging scenarios, including visual cue impaired, unseen languages, target speaker switches, increased interfering speakers, and out-of-domain test set.

### [648] [Towards Optimal Constellation Design for Digital Over-the-Air Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06372)
*Saeed Razavikia,Deniz Gündüz,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper addresses Over-the-air computation (OAC) for efficient function calculation over multiple-access channels, using an optimized digital modulation framework to reduce mean-squared error under transmit power constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OAC methods using analog modulation suffer from noise sensitivity and hardware limitations, requiring improved approaches for computation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

Method: The authors propose a novel digital modulation framework, formulated as an additive mapping problem to optimize constellations, minimizing MSE under a power constraint. They derive closed-form analytical solutions and extend the method to higher-dimensional use cases.

Result: The paper establishes a unique solution for optimal constellation design, analyzes performance in high SNR conditions using generalized Lambert functions, and explores extensions to non-Gaussian noise models and real-domain computation.

Conclusion: The study paves the way for more robust and efficient computation frameworks in wireless communication using optimized digital-based modulation and extends its applicability to broader noise models and domains.

Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) has emerged as a key technique for efficient function computation over multiple-access channels (MACs) by exploiting the waveform superposition property of the wireless domain. While conventional OAC methods rely on analog amplitude modulation, their performance is often limited by noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, motivating the use of digital modulation schemes. This paper proposes a novel digital modulation framework optimized for computation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The design is formulated as an additive mapping problem to determine the optimal constellation that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) under a transmit power constraint. We express the optimal constellation design as a system of nonlinear equations and establish the conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of its solution. In the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal modulation parameters using the generalized Lambert function, providing analytical insight into the system's behavior. Furthermore, we discuss extensions of the framework to higher-dimensional grids corresponding to multiple channel uses, to non-Gaussian noise models, and to computation over real-valued domains via hybrid digital-analog modulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for decentralization of entangled dynamics in multi-agent systems and addressing challenging problems like time-varying density functions.

Method: A framework is developed tackling challenges in multi-agent systems with convergence guarantees and decentralizing entangled dynamics.

Result: The framework is successfully applied to leader-follower formation, decentralized coverage without approximations, and safe navigation in dense environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, generalizable, and addresses complex, long-standing challenges in decentralized multi-agent control.

Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for multi-agent control synthesis, which applies to a wide range of problems with convergence guarantees, regardless of the complexity of the underlying graph topology and the explicit time dependence of the objective function. The proposed framework systematically addresses a particularly challenging problem in multi-agent systems, i.e., decentralization of entangled dynamics among different agents, and it naturally supports multi-objective robotics and real-time implementations. To demonstrate its generality and effectiveness, the framework is implemented across three experiments, namely time-varying leader-follower formation control, decentralized coverage control for time-varying density functions without any approximations, which is a long-standing open problem, and safe formation navigation in dense environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model-free adaptive control method to reduce vibrations in a cantilevered beam using a sampled-data adaptive controller and evaluates the effects of displacement and acceleration feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively suppressing vibrations in a cantilevered beam under unknown disturbances, especially when higher frequency modes may be excited.

Method: A model-free adaptive control approach is applied using retrospective cost optimization. A filter is developed to extract displacement data from acceleration measurements to improve suppression.

Result: The study demonstrates successful vibration suppression performance when comparing feedback from both displacement and acceleration measurements.

Conclusion: The presented model-free adaptive controller, coupled with filtering, effectively suppresses vibrations and provides insights into optimal feedback strategies for performance improvement.

Abstract: This paper presents a model-free adaptive control approach to suppress vibrations in a cantilevered beam excited by an unknown disturbance. The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances. Both displacement and acceleration measurements are considered for feedback. Since acceleration measurements are more sensitive to spillover, which excites higher frequency modes, a filter is developed to extract key displacement information from the acceleration data and enhance suppression performance. The vibration suppression performance is compared using both displacement and acceleration measurements.

TL;DR: The chapter introduces an 11-layer failure stack for AI vulnerabilities and proposes "awareness mapping" to help individuals and organizations identify and address reliability risks, thereby enabling trustworthy AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to enhance organizational and individual readiness in managing reliability risks of generative and agentic AI systems, ensuring trustworthy AI deployment in critical areas.

Method: The chapter structures vulnerabilities into an 11-layer failure stack and develops an 'awareness mapping' framework to diagnose and prioritize reliability risks for improvement and governance purposes.

Result: The approach interlinks failure diagnosis with awareness levels, demonstrating how these tools inform Dependability-Centred Asset Management (DCAM) and resilience planning.

Conclusion: By integrating failure analysis with awareness mapping, the study offers a practical and strategic approach to achieving reliability and sustainability in AI systems across essential domains.

Abstract: This chapter bridges technical analysis and organizational preparedness by tracing the path from layered failure modes to reliability awareness in generative and agentic AI systems. We first introduce an 11-layer failure stack, a structured framework for identifying vulnerabilities ranging from hardware and power foundations to adaptive learning and agentic reasoning. Building on this, the chapter demonstrates how failures rarely occur in isolation but propagate across layers, creating cascading effects with systemic consequences. To complement this diagnostic lens, we develop the concept of awareness mapping: a maturity-oriented framework that quantifies how well individuals and organizations recognize reliability risks across the AI stack. Awareness is treated not only as a diagnostic score but also as a strategic input for AI governance, guiding improvement and resilience planning. By linking layered failures to awareness levels and further integrating this into Dependability-Centred Asset Management (DCAM), the chapter positions awareness mapping as both a measurement tool and a roadmap for trustworthy and sustainable AI deployment across mission-critical domains.

### [652] [Policy Gradient-Based EMT-in-the-Loop Learning to Mitigate Sub-Synchronous Control Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05822)
*Sayak Mukherjee,Ramij R. Hossain,Kaustav Chatterjee,Sameer Nekkalapu,Marcelo Elizondo*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework using a simulation-based approach to adaptively control and mitigate sub-synchronous oscillations in power systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) stem from mis-tuned control gains under specific grid configurations. Mitigating SSCI requires adaptive gain tuning based on dynamic grid conditions.

Method: The authors utilized reinforcement learning (particularly, deep policy gradient methods) integrated with signal processing modules such as bandpass filtering and oscillation-specific reward computations to re-tune control gains through simulations.

Result: Experimentation demonstrated that the trained reinforcement learning policy can adaptively adjust control gains to effectively suppress oscillations in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning, with appropriate signal processing and training, can be a viable method to dynamically adapt control settings and mitigate oscillation issues in power systems.

Abstract: This paper explores the development of learning-based tunable control gains using EMT-in-the-loop simulation framework (e.g., PSCAD interfaced with Python-based learning modules) to address critical sub-synchronous oscillations. Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations. Our experimentation in a real-world event setting demonstrates that the deep policy gradient based trained policy can adaptively compute gain settings in response to varying grid conditions and optimally suppress control interaction-induced oscillations.

*Zhaohui Yang,Dawei Ding,Qi Ye,Cupjin Huang,Jianxin Chen,Yuan Xie*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces the concept of "reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers" (ReQISC) to improve the performance of quantum hardware by enabling more efficient and expressive 2-qubit gate implementation and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum hardware struggles due to limited performance, high calibration overhead, and challenging compiler optimization, even with advanced ISAs.

Method: The authors present the ReQISC concept which includes a unified microarchitecture for efficient implementation of arbitrary 2Q gates, and a customized compilation framework for optimization tailored to ReQISC primitives.

Result: ReQISC reduces pulse duration, gate count, circuit depth, and mapping overhead compared to conventional methods. It achieves significant advancements in program fidelity and hardware efficiency.

Conclusion: ReQISC demonstrates the feasibility of continuous ISAs, bringing theoretical benefits into practical usage and enhancing quantum computing performance.

Abstract: The performance of current quantum hardware is severely limited. While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical.
  To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of "reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead.
  We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in learning low-rank dynamical network topologies and proposes an identifiable model using causal Wiener filtering with successful simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing topology learning methods struggle with low-rank dynamics, creating the need for a specialized framework for these processes.

Method: The authors introduce a low rank dynamical network model and use causal Wiener filtering to derive conditions connecting filter sparsity to Granger causality. They then develop a consistent edge estimation method.

Result: Simulation results validate the framework's efficiency and consistency in estimating network topologies.

Conclusion: The proposed model ensures identifiability, provides theoretical foundations for causal inference, and demonstrates reliable estimation in practice.

Abstract: Conventional topology learning methods for dynamical networks become inapplicable to processes exhibiting low-rank characteristics. To address this, we propose the low rank dynamical network model which ensures identifiability. By employing causal Wiener filtering, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition that links the sparsity pattern of the filter to conditional Granger causality. Building on this theoretical result, we develop a consistent method for estimating all network edges. Simulation results demonstrate the parsimony of the proposed framework and consistency of the topology estimation approach.

*Marcel Müller*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for resolving deadlocks caused by autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) in intralogistics systems, comparing its effectiveness to traditional rule-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve operational flexibility and reliability in intralogistics systems by addressing deadlock issues that arise due to AMRs.

Method: Developed a structured methodology for integrating MARL into logistics planning/control, used reference models for deadlock-capable MAPF, and employed grid-based environments with external simulation to compare MARL methods (PPO and IMPALA) against rule-based strategies.

Result: MARL-based strategies, especially with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), perform better in congested environments, whereas rule-based methods remain competitive in simpler scenarios due to lower computational costs.

Conclusion: MARL offers a flexible and scalable solution for deadlock handling in intralogistics, but its effectiveness depends on careful adaptation to the specific operational context.

Abstract: This dissertation explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for handling deadlocks in intralogistics systems that rely on autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). AMRs enhance operational flexibility but also increase the risk of deadlocks, which degrade system throughput and reliability. Existing approaches often neglect deadlock handling in the planning phase and rely on rigid control rules that cannot adapt to dynamic operational conditions.
  To address these shortcomings, this work develops a structured methodology for integrating MARL into logistics planning and operational control. It introduces reference models that explicitly consider deadlock-capable multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, enabling systematic evaluation of MARL strategies. Using grid-based environments and an external simulation software, the study compares traditional deadlock handling strategies with MARL-based solutions, focusing on PPO and IMPALA algorithms under different training and execution modes.
  Findings reveal that MARL-based strategies, particularly when combined with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based methods in complex, congested environments. In simpler environments or those with ample spatial freedom, rule-based methods remain competitive due to their lower computational demands. These results highlight that MARL provides a flexible and scalable solution for deadlock handling in dynamic intralogistics scenarios, but requires careful tailoring to the operational context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the real-world risks of large language model agents participating in collective financial fraud within multi-agent systems.

Method: Development of MultiAgentFraudBench, a benchmark simulating 28 online fraud scenarios, complemented by analysis of fraud lifecycle and testing mitigation strategies.

Result: The study revealed key factors affecting fraud success and adaptability of malicious agents to interventions, emphasizing potential risks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Multi-agent financial fraud risks are significant but can be mitigated through content warnings, monitoring by LLMs, and societal-level collaboration against fraud.

Abstract: In this work, we study the risks of collective financial fraud in large-scale multi-agent systems powered by large language model (LLM) agents. We investigate whether agents can collaborate in fraudulent behaviors, how such collaboration amplifies risks, and what factors influence fraud success. To support this research, we present MultiAgentFraudBench, a large-scale benchmark for simulating financial fraud scenarios based on realistic online interactions. The benchmark covers 28 typical online fraud scenarios, spanning the full fraud lifecycle across both public and private domains. We further analyze key factors affecting fraud success, including interaction depth, activity level, and fine-grained collaboration failure modes. Finally, we propose a series of mitigation strategies, including adding content-level warnings to fraudulent posts and dialogues, using LLMs as monitors to block potentially malicious agents, and fostering group resilience through information sharing at the societal level. Notably, we observe that malicious agents can adapt to environmental interventions. Our findings highlight the real-world risks of multi-agent financial fraud and suggest practical measures for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/zheng977/MutiAgent4Fraud.

TL;DR: The paper examines the evaluation landscape for foundation models, focusing on their societal impacts like bias and environmental cost. It finds gaps in evaluations and urges for better transparency and independent evaluation ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governance frameworks for AI rely on evaluations to understand risks and societal impacts, but there is uneven coverage of social impact assessments in the AI ecosystem.

Method: A comprehensive analysis of 186 first-party reports, 183 third-party evaluation sources, and interviews with model developers to study evaluation practices and gaps.

Result: First-party evaluations are limited and declining in areas like bias and environmental impact. Third-party evaluations are more rigorous but cannot address some aspects that only developers can report.

Conclusion: Current practices inadequately assess AI's societal impacts, necessitating policies for improved transparency, strengthened independent evaluations, and shared infrastructure for consistent assessments.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly central to high-stakes AI systems, and governance frameworks now depend on evaluations to assess their risks and capabilities. Although general capability evaluations are widespread, social impact assessments covering bias, fairness, privacy, environmental costs, and labor practices remain uneven across the AI ecosystem. To characterize this landscape, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of both first-party and third-party social impact evaluation reporting across a wide range of model developers. Our study examines 186 first-party release reports and 183 post-release evaluation sources, and complements this quantitative analysis with interviews of model developers. We find a clear division of evaluation labor: first-party reporting is sparse, often superficial, and has declined over time in key areas such as environmental impact and bias, while third-party evaluators including academic researchers, nonprofits, and independent organizations provide broader and more rigorous coverage of bias, harmful content, and performance disparities. However, this complementarity has limits. Only model developers can authoritatively report on data provenance, content moderation labor, financial costs, and training infrastructure, yet interviews reveal that these disclosures are often deprioritized unless tied to product adoption or regulatory compliance. Our findings indicate that current evaluation practices leave major gaps in assessing AI's societal impacts, highlighting the urgent need for policies that promote developer transparency, strengthen independent evaluation ecosystems, and create shared infrastructure to aggregate and compare third-party evaluations in a consistent and accessible way.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a memory-based student simulation framework to better model gradual knowledge construction, developmental trajectories, and individual learner characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current student simulations in educational applications fail to account for students’ gradual knowledge construction, developmental constraints, and evolving skills, creating a gap in accurately modeling real learner dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation, integrating metacognitive processes and personality traits to simulate cognitive and personal learning development dynamically.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed simulator effectively models gradual knowledge development and common student difficulties, aligning with curriculum standards like the Next Generation Science Standards.

Conclusion: The framework advances educational AI by offering a more realistic representation of student learning processes, addressing limitations in existing simulations.

Abstract: User simulation is important for developing and evaluating human-centered AI, yet current student simulation in educational applications has significant limitations. Existing approaches focus on single learning experiences and do not account for students' gradual knowledge construction and evolving skill sets. Moreover, large language models are optimized to produce direct and accurate responses, making it challenging to represent the incomplete understanding and developmental constraints that characterize real learners. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for memory-based student simulation that incorporates developmental trajectories through a hierarchical memory mechanism with structured knowledge representation. The framework also integrates metacognitive processes and personality traits to enrich the individual learner profiling, through dynamical consolidation of both cognitive development and personal learning characteristics. In practice, we implement a curriculum-aligned simulator grounded on the Next Generation Science Standards. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively reflect the gradual nature of knowledge development and the characteristic difficulties students face, providing a more accurate representation of learning processes.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on the intersection of AI and educational dialogue, exploring AI's benefits, risks, and impacts on dialogic teaching and learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI is rapidly progressing in education, creating opportunities but also risks, requiring experts to address its effects on human agency, equity, and learning.

Method: An international workshop gathered researchers from 11 countries to discuss key questions about AI's role and effects in educational dialogue.

Result: The discussions addressed when AI is beneficial or harmful in education and examined conditions for better AI-integrated dialogic teaching.

Conclusion: AI's integration in educational dialogue could enhance learning but must be managed carefully to avoid undermining human effort and exacerbating inequities.

Abstract: Educational dialogue -the collaborative exchange of ideas through talk- is widely recognized as a catalyst for deeper learning and critical thinking in and across contexts. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a powerful force in education, with the potential to address major challenges, personalize learning, and innovate teaching practices. However, these advances come with significant risks: rapid AI development can undermine human agency, exacerbate inequities, and outpace our capacity to guide its use with sound policy. Human learning presupposes cognitive efforts and social interaction (dialogues). In response to this evolving landscape, an international workshop titled "Educational Dialogue: Moving Thinking Forward" convened 19 leading researchers from 11 countries in Cambridge (September 1-3, 2025) to examine the intersection of AI and educational dialogue. This AI-focused strand of the workshop centered on three critical questions: (1) When is AI truly useful in education, and when might it merely replace human effort at the expense of learning? (2) Under what conditions can AI use lead to better dialogic teaching and learning? (3) Does the AI-human partnership risk outpacing and displacing human educational work, and what are the implications? These questions framed two days of presentations and structured dialogue among participants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing simulated students for evaluating educational approaches, analyzing diverse learner profiles, and overcoming real-world challenges in systematic pedagogical research.

Method: Provides a literature review on LLM-based simulated agents, focusing on their capabilities in mimicking learner archetypes and conducting pedagogical dialogues, while reviewing empirical findings from educational studies.

Result: Findings showcase LLMs as versatile tools for modeling linguistic realism, behavioral adaptability, and classroom simulations, with demonstrated strengths over traditional rule-based systems.

Conclusion: Although LLMs show promise for educational applications, challenges such as bias, reliability, and alignment with goals persist, needing further research for effective integration into adaptive learning and instructional systems.

Abstract: Simulated Students offer a valuable methodological framework for evaluating pedagogical approaches and modelling diverse learner profiles, tasks which are otherwise challenging to undertake systematically in real-world settings. Recent research has increasingly focused on developing such simulated agents to capture a range of learning styles, cognitive development pathways, and social behaviours. Among contemporary simulation techniques, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational research has emerged as a particularly versatile and scalable paradigm. LLMs afford a high degree of linguistic realism and behavioural adaptability, enabling agents to approximate cognitive processes and engage in contextually appropriate pedagogical dialogues. This paper presents a thematic review of empirical and methodological studies utilising LLMs to simulate student behaviour across educational environments. We synthesise current evidence on the capacity of LLM-based agents to emulate learner archetypes, respond to instructional inputs, and interact within multi-agent classroom scenarios. Furthermore, we examine the implications of such systems for curriculum development, instructional evaluation, and teacher training. While LLMs surpass rule-based systems in natural language generation and situational flexibility, ongoing concerns persist regarding algorithmic bias, evaluation reliability, and alignment with educational objectives. The review identifies existing technological and methodological gaps and proposes future research directions for integrating generative AI into adaptive learning systems and instructional design.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the potential of generative AI models for providing legal assistance in Bangladesh but highlights the risks of misinformation and the need for safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to address the challenges in accessing legal help in Bangladesh, including high fees, complex legal language, lawyer shortages, and millions of unresolved cases, by evaluating whether generative AI models can democratize legal assistance.

Method: The study collected 250 legal questions from a Facebook group and tested responses generated by four advanced AI models using a consistent prompt. Responses were evaluated by both a state-of-the-art LLM judge and licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals based on four criteria: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity.

Result: AI models often produced high-quality, well-structured legal responses but also generated dangerous misinformation such as fabricated citations and incorrect advice.

Conclusion: There is potential for AI to assist in legal services, but rigorous expert validation and safeguards are essential to ensure safe deployment in the legal field in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Accessing legal help in Bangladesh is hard. People face high fees, complex legal language, a shortage of lawyers, and millions of unresolved court cases. Generative AI models like OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Meta Llama 3 70B, and DeepSeek R1 could potentially democratize legal assistance by providing quick and affordable legal advice. In this study, we collected 250 authentic legal questions from the Facebook group "Know Your Rights," where verified legal experts regularly provide authoritative answers. These questions were subsequently submitted to four four advanced AI models and responses were generated using a consistent, standardized prompt. A comprehensive dual evaluation framework was employed, in which a state-of-the-art LLM model served as a judge, assessing each AI-generated response across four critical dimensions: factual accuracy, legal appropriateness, completeness, and clarity. Following this, the same set of questions was evaluated by three licensed Bangladeshi legal professionals according to the same criteria. In addition, automated evaluation metrics, including BLEU scores, were applied to assess response similarity. Our findings reveal a complex landscape where AI models frequently generate high-quality, well-structured legal responses but also produce dangerous misinformation, including fabricated case citations, incorrect legal procedures, and potentially harmful advice. These results underscore the critical need for rigorous expert validation and comprehensive safeguards before AI systems can be safely deployed for legal consultation in Bangladesh.

### [662] [Large Language Models Develop Novel Social Biases Through Adaptive Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06148)
*Addison J. Wu,Ryan Liu,Xuechunzi Bai,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can spontaneously develop new social biases, even without inherent differences, and cause unfair task allocations. Explicit interventions like incentivizing exploration can mitigate this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine and address the emergence of novel social biases in LLMs as they are increasingly used to make decisions, especially considering the limitations of current de-biasing approaches.

Method: The study uses psychological paradigms to demonstrate emergent biases in LLMs, identifying causes such as exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Researchers test interventions focusing on model inputs, problem structures, and explicit steering to reduce biases.

Result: Emergent social biases in LLMs create unfair task allocations, worsened by larger models. Interventions targeting exploration showed the greatest success in reducing stratification and bias.

Conclusion: LLMs are not just passive reflectors of human biases; they can actively generate new ones. New strategies, like incentivizing exploration, are crucial to mitigate these risks and to manage LLMs' societal impact.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted into frameworks that grant them the capacity to make real decisions, it is increasingly important to ensure that they are unbiased. In this paper, we argue that the predominant approach of simply removing existing biases from models is not enough. Using a paradigm from the psychology literature, we demonstrate that LLMs can spontaneously develop novel social biases about artificial demographic groups even when no inherent differences exist. These biases result in highly stratified task allocations, which are less fair than assignments by human participants and are exacerbated by newer and larger models. In social science, emergent biases like these have been shown to result from exploration-exploitation trade-offs, where the decision-maker explores too little, allowing early observations to strongly influence impressions about entire demographic groups. To alleviate this effect, we examine a series of interventions targeting model inputs, problem structure, and explicit steering. We find that explicitly incentivizing exploration most robustly reduces stratification, highlighting the need for better multifaceted objectives to mitigate bias. These results reveal that LLMs are not merely passive mirrors of human social biases, but can actively create new ones from experience, raising urgent questions about how these systems will shape societies over time.

### [663] [Place Matters: Comparing LLM Hallucination Rates for Place-Based Legal Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06700)
*Damian Curran,Vanessa Sporne,Lea Frermann,Jeannie Paterson*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper compares the quality of legal knowledge output from large language models (LLMs) across different locations globally by analyzing hallucination rates and uncertainties in the model's predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to determine whether LLMs provide consistent and high-quality legal advice across different locations, which is crucial for equitable access to legal information.

Method: Using a dataset of Reddit posts on legal issues, summaries of applicable laws in Los Angeles, London, and Sydney are elicited from LLMs and manually checked for hallucinations. Differences in hallucination rates are measured and correlated with prediction frequency.

Result: It was found that hallucination rates vary significantly by location, indicating uneven legal information quality globally. Higher uncertainty (infrequent majority responses) strongly correlates with increased hallucination rates.

Conclusion: The location-dependent variation in outputs of LLM-based legal advice suggests that these models provide differing levels of legal accuracy across geographies, raising concerns about the equitable distribution of legal knowledge.

Abstract: How do we make a meaningful comparison of a large language model's knowledge of the law in one place compared to another? Quantifying these differences is critical to understanding if the quality of the legal information obtained by users of LLM-based chatbots varies depending on their location. However, obtaining meaningful comparative metrics is challenging because legal institutions in different places are not themselves easily comparable. In this work we propose a methodology to obtain place-to-place metrics based on the comparative law concept of functionalism. We construct a dataset of factual scenarios drawn from Reddit posts by users seeking legal advice for family, housing, employment, crime and traffic issues. We use these to elicit a summary of a law from the LLM relevant to each scenario in Los Angeles, London and Sydney. These summaries, typically of a legislative provision, are manually evaluated for hallucinations. We show that the rate of hallucination of legal information by leading closed-source LLMs is significantly associated with place. This suggests that the quality of legal solutions provided by these models is not evenly distributed across geography. Additionally, we show a strong negative correlation between hallucination rate and the frequency of the majority response when the LLM is sampled multiple times, suggesting a measure of uncertainty of model predictions of legal facts.

*Amit Vaisman,Guy Ohayon,Hila Manor,Michael Elad,Tomer Michaeli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Turbo-DDCM, an efficient image compression method using diffusion-based techniques, overcoming performance and speed limitations in current zero-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiencies and computational demands of zero-shot diffusion-based compression methods while maintaining high performance.

Method: Turbo-DDCM modifies Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCM) by combining multiple noise vectors at each denoising step, reducing operations. It includes priority-aware and distortion-controlled variants for flexible applications.

Result: Turbo-DDCM demonstrates faster compression and flexible encoding strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: Turbo-DDCM provides a practical, efficient, and versatile image compression approach, improving on existing zero-shot methods.

Abstract: While zero-shot diffusion-based compression methods have seen significant progress in recent years, they remain notoriously slow and computationally demanding. This paper presents an efficient zero-shot diffusion-based compression method that runs substantially faster than existing methods, while maintaining performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. Our method builds upon the recently proposed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCMs) compression scheme. Specifically, DDCM compresses an image by sequentially choosing the diffusion noise vectors from reproducible random codebooks, guiding the denoiser's output to reconstruct the target image. We modify this framework with Turbo-DDCM, which efficiently combines a large number of noise vectors at each denoising step, thereby significantly reducing the number of required denoising operations. This modification is also coupled with an improved encoding protocol. Furthermore, we introduce two flexible variants of Turbo-DDCM, a priority-aware variant that prioritizes user-specified regions and a distortion-controlled variant that compresses an image based on a target PSNR rather than a target BPP. Comprehensive experiments position Turbo-DDCM as a compelling, practical, and flexible image compression scheme.

*Tong Chen,Xinyu Ma,Long Bai,Wenyang Wang,Sun Yue,Luping Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EndoIR is a novel degradation-agnostic diffusion framework capable of restoring multiple degradation types in endoscopic images using a single model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic images often face multiple types of degradation, such as low lighting, smoke, and bleeding, which obscure important clinical details. Existing methods fail to generalize well as they are task-specific and require prior knowledge of degradation types, limiting their clinical usefulness.

Method: The paper introduces EndoIR with a Dual-Domain Prompter for joint spatial-frequency feature extraction and an adaptive embedding for conditioning the model with shared and task-specific cues. The Dual-Stream Diffusion processes clean and degraded inputs separately to avoid feature confusion, and the Rectified Fusion Block integrates them in a structured way. The Noise-Aware Routing Block dynamically filters noise-relevant features.

Result: EndoIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SegSTRONG-C and CEC datasets across multiple degradation scenarios, with fewer parameters. Its clinical application was validated through downstream segmentation experiments.

Conclusion: EndoIR demonstrates robustness and efficiency in restoring diverse degradations in endoscopic images without prior knowledge of degradation, making it a promising tool for improving clinical image analysis.

Abstract: Endoscopic images often suffer from diverse and co-occurring degradations such as low lighting, smoke, and bleeding, which obscure critical clinical details. Existing restoration methods are typically task-specific and often require prior knowledge of the degradation type, limiting their robustness in real-world clinical use. We propose EndoIR, an all-in-one, degradation-agnostic diffusion-based framework that restores multiple degradation types using a single model. EndoIR introduces a Dual-Domain Prompter that extracts joint spatial-frequency features, coupled with an adaptive embedding that encodes both shared and task-specific cues as conditioning for denoising. To mitigate feature confusion in conventional concatenation-based conditioning, we design a Dual-Stream Diffusion architecture that processes clean and degraded inputs separately, with a Rectified Fusion Block integrating them in a structured, degradation-aware manner. Furthermore, Noise-Aware Routing Block improves efficiency by dynamically selecting only noise-relevant features during denoising. Experiments on SegSTRONG-C and CEC datasets demonstrate that EndoIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple degradation scenarios while using fewer parameters than strong baselines, and downstream segmentation experiments confirm its clinical utility.

*Jophy Lin*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neural ensemble model with uncertainty estimation to enhance diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, achieving notable accuracy and confidence calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of blindness with high underdiagnosis rates due to traditional diagnostic limitations in cost, scalability, and asymptomatic nature.

Method: The study introduces an ensemble framework using seven CNN architectures with accuracy-weighted majority voting and probability-weighted entropy metrics for uncertainty quantification.

Result: The framework achieved 93.70% accuracy and 99.44% accuracy with uncertainty filtering on 35,000 retinal images.

Conclusion: The integration of uncertainty-aware ensembling improves diagnostic reliability and scalability for automated diabetic retinopathy detection, promising trustworthiness in medical AI applications.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a microvascular complication of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness, is projected to affect more than 130 million individuals worldwide by 2030. Early identification is essential to reduce irreversible vision loss, yet current diagnostic workflows rely on methods such as fundus photography and expert review, which remain costly and resource-intensive. This, combined with DR's asymptomatic nature, results in its underdiagnosis rate of approximately 25 percent. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, limited interpretability and the absence of uncertainty quantification restrict clinical reliability. Therefore, in this study, a deep ensemble learning framework integrated with uncertainty estimation is introduced to improve robustness, transparency, and scalability in DR detection. The ensemble incorporates seven CNN architectures-ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), and EfficientNet (B0, B2, B3)- whose outputs are fused through an accuracy-weighted majority voting strategy. A probability-weighted entropy metric quantifies prediction uncertainty, enabling low-confidence samples to be excluded or flagged for additional review. Training and validation on 35,000 EyePACS retinal fundus images produced an unfiltered accuracy of 93.70 percent (F1 = 0.9376). Uncertainty-filtering later was conducted to remove unconfident samples, resulting in maximum-accuracy of 99.44 percent (F1 = 0.9932). The framework shows that uncertainty-aware, accuracy-weighted ensembling improves reliability without hindering performance. With confidence-calibrated outputs and a tunable accuracy-coverage trade-off, it offers a generalizable paradigm for deploying trustworthy AI diagnostics in high-risk care.

The framework integrates user-specified keywords to generate personalized outputs, ensuring that only the most relevant contexts are highlighted. These personalized summaries provide an intermediate layer that supports language models in producing investor-focused narratives, bridging the gap between raw news and actionable insights.

### [668] [A Provably-Correct and Robust Convex Model for Smooth Separable NMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07109)
*Junjun Pan,Valentin Leplat,Michael Ng,Nicolas Gillis*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces and analyzes smooth separable nonnegative matrix factorization (SSNMF), a refinement of separable NMF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonnegative matrix factorization applications are commonly affected by challenges such as non-uniqueness of solutions and sensitivity to noise. Addressing these limitations can improve analytical accuracy and robustness.

Method: The authors introduce SSNMF, a model assuming each basis vector is close to multiple data points, which enhances separability. They formulate a convex model and use an adapted fast gradient method to solve it.

Result: SSNMF effectively recovers factors even under noise and outperforms current methods on synthetic and hyperspectral datasets.

Conclusion: SSNMF provides a robust and efficient improvement over separable NMF, with theoretical guarantees and practical superiority in application contexts.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique for nonnegative data, with applications such as hyperspectral unmixing and topic modeling. NMF is a difficult problem in general (NP-hard), and its solutions are typically not unique. To address these two issues, additional constraints or assumptions are often used. In particular, separability assumes that the basis vectors in the NMF are equal to some columns of the input matrix. In that case, the problem is referred to as separable NMF (SNMF) and can be solved in polynomial-time with robustness guarantees, while identifying a unique solution. However, in real-world scenarios, due to noise or variability, multiple data points may lie near the basis vectors, which SNMF does not leverage. In this work, we rely on the smooth separability assumption, which assumes that each basis vector is close to multiple data points. We explore the properties of the corresponding problem, referred to as smooth SNMF (SSNMF), and examine how it relates to SNMF and orthogonal NMF. We then propose a convex model for SSNMF and show that it provably recovers the sought-after factors, even in the presence of noise. We finally adapt an existing fast gradient method to solve this convex model for SSNMF, and show that it compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and hyperspectral datasets.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks two advanced deep density methods, the deep splitting filter and the deep BSDE filter, for nonlinear filtering in stochastic differential equations, demonstrating their superior scalability and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges in filtering high-dimensional stochastic systems, where traditional particle-based methods fail or become computationally inefficient.

Method: The authors extend two deep density methods, deep splitting filter and deep BSDE filter, to logarithmic formulations. These utilize Feynman--Kac formulas, Euler--Maruyama discretizations, and neural networks for modeling filtering densities.

Result: The deep density methods significantly outperformed particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters on challenging benchmarks, particularly in high-dimensional cases like a 100-dimensional Lorenz-96 model, achieving orders of magnitude improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Deep density methods are robust, scalable, and computationally efficient alternatives for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering tasks, outperforming traditional particle-based approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we benchmark two recently developed deep density methods for nonlinear filtering. Starting from the Fokker--Planck equation with Bayes updates, we model the filtering density of a discretely observed SDE. The two filters: the deep splitting filter and the deep BSDE filter, are both based on Feynman--Kac formulas, Euler--Maruyama discretizations and neural networks. The two methods are extended to logarithmic formulations providing sound and robust implementations in increasing state dimension. Comparing to the classical particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters, we benchmark the methods on numerous examples. In the low-dimensional examples the particle filters work well, but when we scale up to a partially observed 100-dimensional Lorenz-96 model the particle-based methods fail and the logarithmic deep density method prevails. In terms of computational efficiency, the deep density methods reduce inference time by roughly two to five orders of magnitude relative to the particle-based filters.

This review surveys recent advances in physics-informed neural networks and operator learning, differentiable molecular simulation, and hybrid physics-ML potentials, with emphasis on long-timescale kinetics, rare events, and free-energy estimation. We frame these approaches as solutions to the "biomolecular closure problem", recovering unresolved interactions beyond classical force fields while preserving thermodynamic consistency and mechanistic interpretability. We examine theoretical foundations, tools and frameworks, computational trade-offs, and unresolved issues, including model expressiveness and stability. We outline prospective research avenues at the intersection of machine learning, statistical physics, and computational chemistry, contending that future advancements will depend on mechanistic inductive biases, and integrated differentiable physical learning frameworks for biomolecular simulation and discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical autoregressive framework for simulating protein dynamics, emphasizing temporally coherent and realistic trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating temporally coherent and realistic protein ensemble trajectories, which are crucial for understanding protein functional mechanisms.

Method: A Markovian two-scale framework where a low-resolution model captures large-scale motions and a high-resolution model simulates detailed local fluctuations.

Result: The approach successfully preserves the causal dependencies in protein dynamics, ensuring realistic and temporally coherent simulation trajectories.

Conclusion: The framework bridges biophysical principles with advanced generative modeling to balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy in protein dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic behavior of proteins is critical to elucidating their functional mechanisms, yet generating realistic, temporally coherent trajectories of protein ensembles remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel hierarchical autoregressive framework for modeling protein dynamics that leverages the intrinsic multi-scale organization of molecular motions. Unlike existing methods that focus on generating static conformational ensembles or treat dynamic sampling as an independent process, our approach characterizes protein dynamics as a Markovian process. The framework employs a two-scale architecture: a low-resolution model captures slow, collective motions driving major conformational transitions, while a high-resolution model generates detailed local fluctuations conditioned on these large-scale movements. This hierarchical design ensures that the causal dependencies inherent in protein dynamics are preserved, enabling the generation of temporally coherent and physically realistic trajectories. By bridging high-level biophysical principles with state-of-the-art generative modeling, our approach provides an efficient framework for simulating protein dynamics that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy.

*Nan Jiang,Ziyi Wang,Yexiang Xue*

Main category: cs.SC

TL;DR: This paper introduces EGG-SR, a symbolic regression framework that uses e-graphs to compactly represent equivalent expressions, improving efficiency in learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic regression often faces computational challenges due to the exponential growth of search space and syntactic redundancy among equivalent expressions.

Method: The authors propose EGG-SR, which incorporates equality graphs (e-graphs) into symbolic regression algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs).

Result: EGG-SR enhances existing symbolic regression algorithms, achieves lower normalized mean squared error across benchmarks, and shows empirical improvements.

Conclusion: EGG-SR successfully reduces redundancy in symbolic regression, leading to more efficient computations and accurate equation discovery.

Abstract: Symbolic regression seeks to uncover physical laws from experimental data by searching for closed-form expressions, which is an important task in AI-driven scientific discovery. Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the effective search space and accelerating training lies in symbolic equivalence: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\log(x_1^2)+\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\log(x_1)+3\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates equality graphs (e-graphs) into diverse symbolic regression algorithms, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and large language models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module, enabling more efficient learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalence classes in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Under mild assumptions, we show that embedding e-graphs tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances multiple baselines across challenging benchmarks, discovering equations with lower normalized mean squared error than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: The paper reviews the role of modern GPUs in enhancing large-language models (LLMs) for radiology applications, discussing hardware requirements, optimization strategies, and upcoming advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology tasks using LLMs necessitate high diagnostic accuracy and low latency, requiring advanced GPU hardware to achieve efficiency and scalability.

Method: The paper examines GPU architectures (e.g., NVIDIA's and AMD's products), assesses their performance metrics, and explores computational methods like tensor-core acceleration and multi-GPU scaling for radiology applications.

Result: Empirical findings suggest that suitable GPU resources reduce inference time and improve processing throughput for radiology imaging tasks.

Conclusion: Improved GPU capabilities are indispensable for advancing LLM-based radiology diagnostics through higher efficiency, better accuracy, and addressing deployment challenges.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) are rapidly being applied to radiology, enabling automated image interpretation and report generation tasks. Their deployment in clinical practice requires both high diagnostic accuracy and low inference latency, which in turn demands powerful hardware. High-performance graphical processing units (GPUs) provide the necessary compute and memory throughput to run large LLMs on imaging data. We review modern GPU architectures (e.g. NVIDIA A100/H100, AMD Instinct MI250X/MI300) and key performance metrics of floating-point throughput, memory bandwidth, VRAM capacity. We show how these hardware capabilities affect radiology tasks: for example, generating reports or detecting findings on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR images is computationally intensive and benefits from GPU parallelism and tensor-core acceleration. Empirical studies indicate that using appropriate GPU resources can reduce inference time and improve throughput. We discuss practical challenges including privacy, deployment, cost, power and optimization strategies: mixed-precision, quantization, compression, and multi-GPU scaling. Finally, we anticipate that next-generation features (8-bit tensor cores, enhanced interconnect) will further enable on-premise and federated radiology AI. Advancing GPU infrastructure is essential for safe, efficient LLM-based radiology diagnostics.

Motivation: To support conservative software reliability assessments for safety-critical systems, identifying worst-case predictive probabilities is vital.

Method: Proposed using Bernoulli processes to model software failures, deducing worst-case posterior predictive probabilities and analyzing their asymptotic properties.

Result: Explicit worst-case probabilities were determined while extending robust Bayesian inference methods.

Conclusion: The methods enhance assessments of safety-critical software by providing conservative reliability evaluation using Bayesian frameworks.

Abstract: When using Bayesian inference to support conservative software reliability assessments, it is useful to consider a collection of Bayesian inference problems, with the aim of determining the worst-case value (from this collection) for a posterior predictive probability that characterizes how reliable the software is. Using a Bernoulli process to model the occurrence of software failures, we explicitly determine (from collections of Bayesian inference problems) worst-case posterior predictive probabilities of the software operating without failure in the future. We deduce asymptotic properties of these conservative posterior probabilities and their priors, and illustrate how to use these results in assessments of safety-critical software. This work extends robust Bayesian inference results and so-called conservative Bayesian inference methods.

*Zhaosong Lu,Sanyou Mei*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Sequential Minimax Optimization (SMO) method for solving certain constrained bilevel optimization problems, with promising theoretical and numerical results, improving computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bilevel optimization problems with nonsmooth convex lower-level components and nonconvex upper-level components in a computationally efficient manner.

Method: SMO uses a sequence of minimax subproblems derived via augmented Lagrangian and penalty schemes, employing first-order methods under specific assumptions.

Result: The operation complexity achieved is $O(\varepsilon^{-7}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-6}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$ for convex and strongly convex lower-level objectives, respectively, improving performance significantly compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SMO demonstrates theoretical advancements in complexity and practical numerical superiority over recent methods, making it a promising approach for solving bilevel optimization problems.

Abstract: In this paper we propose a sequential minimax optimization (SMO) method for solving a class of constrained bilevel optimization problems in which the lower-level part is a possibly nonsmooth convex optimization problem, while the upper-level part is a possibly nonconvex optimization problem. Specifically, SMO applies a first-order method to solve a sequence of minimax subproblems, which are obtained by employing a hybrid of modified augmented Lagrangian and penalty schemes on the bilevel optimization problems. Under suitable assumptions, we establish an operation complexity of $O(\varepsilon^{-7}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-6}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$, measured in terms of fundamental operations, for SMO in finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution of the bilevel optimization problems with merely convex and strongly convex lower-level objective functions, respectively. The latter result improves the previous best-known operation complexity by a factor of $\varepsilon^{-1}$. Preliminary numerical results demonstrate significantly superior computational performance compared to the recently developed first-order penalty method.

### [677] [The Algorithmic Phase Transition in Symmetric Correlated Spiked Wigner Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06040)
*Zhangsong Li*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies detecting and estimating correlated signals in spiked Wigner matrices, proposing an algorithm effective beyond traditional computational infeasibility regimes based on a defined threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore efficient algorithms for detecting and estimating signals in correlated spiked Wigner matrices, addressing limitations in regimes deemed computationally challenging.

Method: The method includes defining a threshold function F(λ, μ, ρ) and designing an algorithm to utilize signal correlations in spiked Wigner matrices for detection and estimation.

Result: The algorithm is shown to succeed when F(λ, μ, ρ) > 1. A computational lower bound is also established, showing that algorithms based on low-degree polynomials fail when F(λ, μ, ρ) < 1.

Conclusion: This work identifies the threshold for computational feasibility while leveraging signal correlations, advancing understanding in signal detection and computational thresholds for spiked Wigner matrices.

Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked Wigner matrices. Our model consists of observations
  $$
  X = \tfracλ{\sqrt{n}} xx^{\top} + W \,, \quad Y = \tfracμ{\sqrt{n}} yy^{\top} + Z \,.
  $$
  where $x,y \in \mathbb R^n$ are signal vectors with norm $\|x\|,\|y\| \approx\sqrt{n}$ and correlation $\langle x,y \rangle \approx ρ\|x\|\|y\|$, while $W,Z$ are independent Gaussian noise matrices. We propose an efficient algorithm that succeeds whenever $F(λ,μ,ρ)>1$, where
  $$
  F(λ,μ,ρ)=\max\Big\{ λ,μ, \frac{ λ^2 ρ^2 }{ 1-λ^2+λ^2 ρ^2 } + \frac{ μ^2 ρ^2 }{ 1-μ^2+μ^2 ρ^2 } \Big\} \,.
  $$
  Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from $X$ alone or $y$ from $Y$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic result with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(λ,μ,ρ)<1$, all algorithms based on {\em low-degree polynomials} fails to distinguish $(X,Y)$ with two independent Wigner matrices. This low-degree analysis strongly suggests that $F(λ,μ,ρ)=1$ is the precise computation threshold for this problem.

### [678] [Bernstein-von Mises for Adaptively Collected Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06639)
*Kevin Du,Yash Nair,Lucas Janson*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper extends the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to adaptively collected data, analyzing when Bayesian uncertainty quantification (UQ) aligns with frequentist UQ and clarifying its limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for adaptive data collection methods like bandits and reinforcement learning is crucial due to challenges in ensuring safety and after-study inference. Existing Bayesian UQ methods, though powerful, assume i.i.d. data, which may not hold in adaptive settings.

Method: The authors extend the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to adaptively collected data, theoretically analyzing the equivalence between Bayesian and Wald-type frequentist UQ, and investigating conditions where stability assumptions fail.

Result: The paper proves asymptotic alignment of Bayesian UQ with frequentist UQ under adaptive data collection. It shows positive results when stability conditions are met but provides a surprising negative result when these conditions fail, indicating Bayesian UQ is not valid in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: Bayesian UQ can be effective for adaptively collected data; however, its reliability depends on stability conditions. The study offers important insights into when Bayesian and frequentist UQ agree or diverge.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for adaptively collected data, such as that coming from adaptive experiments, bandits, or reinforcement learning, is necessary for critical elements of data collection such as ensuring safety and conducting after-study inference. The data's adaptivity creates significant challenges for frequentist UQ, yet Bayesian UQ remains the same as if the data were independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), making it an appealing and commonly used approach. Bayesian UQ requires the (correct) specification of a prior distribution while frequentist UQ does not, but for i.i.d. data the celebrated Bernstein-von Mises theorem shows that as the sample size grows, the prior 'washes out' and Bayesian UQ becomes frequentist-valid, implying that the choice of prior need not be a major impediment to Bayesian UQ as it makes no difference asymptotically. This paper for the first time extends the Bernstein-von Mises theorem to adaptively collected data, proving asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian UQ and Wald-type frequentist UQ in this challenging setting. Our result showing this asymptotic agreement does not require the standard stability condition required by works studying validity of Wald-type frequentist UQ; in cases where stability is satisfied, our results combined with these prior studies of frequentist UQ imply frequentist validity of Bayesian UQ. Counterintuitively however, they also provide a negative result that Bayesian UQ is not asymptotically frequentist valid when stability fails, despite the fact that the prior washes out and Bayesian UQ asymptotically matches standard Wald-type frequentist UQ. We empirically validate our theory (positive and negative) via a range of simulations.

### [679] [High-Dimensional Asymptotics of Differentially Private PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07270)
*Youngjoo Yun,Rishabh Dudeja*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper investigates achieving exact noise levels for privacy guarantees in differentially private principal component analysis (PCA), especially in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the challenge of overly pessimistic noise bounds in differential privacy that can hinder meaningful data insights, the paper aims to find precise privacy characterizations and smaller noise levels.

Method: The authors use the exponential mechanism for PCA analysis in a model-free, high-dimensional context. Through hypothesis-testing privacy guarantees and contiguity arguments, they derive sharp characterizations.

Result: They determine that in high dimensions, detecting individual presence equates to distinguishing between two Gaussians with slightly different means, governed by the data's spectral properties.

Conclusion: Accurately identifying minimal noise levels for privacy is feasible and achievable using sharp privacy characterization methods, particularly in high-dimensional PCA settings.

Abstract: In differential privacy, statistics of a sensitive dataset are privatized by introducing random noise. Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\rightarrow\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations.

### [680] [Wasserstein-Cramér-Rao Theory of Unbiased Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07414)
*Nicolás García Trillos,Adam Quinn Jaffe,Bodhisattva Sen*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sensitivity metric based on Wasserstein geometry, akin to a variance metric based on Fisher-Rao geometry, and develops related theoretical results and applications for unbiased estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore a new concept termed 'sensitivity,' measuring the instability of estimators in relation to infinitesimal data perturbations, motivated by classical statistics challenges and the limitations of variance analysis.

Method: Using Wasserstein geometry, the paper formulates a sensitivity framework analogous to classical unbiased estimation theory, deriving results including a Wasserstein-Cramér-Rao lower bound and characterizations of optimal estimators.

Result: The study establishes theoretical parallels to classical estimation theory and demonstrates new properties and estimators achieving sensitivity bounds asymptotically, validated through statistical examples.

Conclusion: The findings extend classical estimation theory by integrating sensitivity analysis under Wasserstein geometry, offering new insights into estimator optimality and introducing novel statistical methods.

Abstract: The quantity of interest in the classical Cramér-Rao theory of unbiased estimation (e.g., the Cramér-Rao lower bound, its exact attainment for exponential families, and asymptotic efficiency of maximum likelihood estimation) is the variance, which represents the instability of an estimator when its value is compared to the value for an independently-sampled data set from the same distribution. In this paper we are interested in a quantity which represents the instability of an estimator when its value is compared to the value for an infinitesimal additive perturbation of the original data set; we refer to this as the "sensitivity" of an estimator. The resulting theory of sensitivity is based on the Wasserstein geometry in the same way that the classical theory of variance is based on the Fisher-Rao (equivalently, Hellinger) geometry, and this insight allows us to determine a collection of results which are analogous to the classical case: a Wasserstein-Cramér-Rao lower bound for the sensitivity of any unbiased estimator, a characterization of models in which there exist unbiased estimators achieving the lower bound exactly, and some concrete results that show that the Wasserstein projection estimator achieves the lower bound asymptotically. We use these results to treat many statistical examples, sometimes revealing new optimality properties for existing estimators and other times revealing entirely new estimators.

### [681] [Counterfactual Forecasting For Panel Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06189)
*Navonil Deb,Raaz Dwivedi,Sumanta Basu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces FOCUS, a novel method for forecasting counterfactual outcomes in panel data with missing entries by leveraging temporal dynamics and autoregressive components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the prediction accuracy of unobserved counterfactual outcomes in panel data, particularly in causal inference scenarios with missing data and time-dependent factors.

Method: FOCUS builds on PCA estimators and integrates both stochastic and deterministic temporal dynamics of latent factors to forecast counterfactuals. It includes error bounds and asymptotic normality results.

Result: Empirical results show FOCUS outperforms existing benchmarks when dealing with autoregressive latent factors, based on evaluations such as predicting step counts in health studies.

Conclusion: FOCUS effectively predicts counterfactual outcomes by incorporating temporal patterns, offering a flexible tool for various applications, including health studies like HeartSteps.

Abstract: We address the challenge of forecasting counterfactual outcomes in a panel data with missing entries and temporally dependent latent factors -- a common scenario in causal inference, where estimating unobserved potential outcomes ahead of time is essential. We propose Forecasting Counterfactuals under Stochastic Dynamics (FOCUS), a method that extends traditional matrix completion methods by leveraging time series dynamics of the factors, thereby enhancing the prediction accuracy of future counterfactuals. Building upon a PCA estimator, our method accommodates both stochastic and deterministic components within the factors, and provides a flexible framework for various applications. In case of stationary autoregressive factors and under standard conditions, we derive error bounds and establish asymptotic normality of our estimator. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing benchmarks when the latent factors have an autoregressive component. We illustrate FOCUS results on HeartSteps, a mobile health study, illustrating its effectiveness in forecasting step counts for users receiving activity prompts, thereby leveraging temporal patterns in user behavior.

### [682] [Approximate Bayesian inference for cumulative probit regression models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06967)
*Emanuele Aliverti*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper focuses on scalable Bayesian inference algorithms for cumulative probit models, using both Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation, showing better computational performance compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently compute Bayesian inference for ordinal outcomes in large datasets, as standard methods scale poorly.

Method: The paper proposes three algorithms based on Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation for faster and more accurate posterior computation.

Result: The proposed algorithms demonstrate superior computational efficiency and accuracy compared to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

Conclusion: The scalable algorithms are effective tools for Bayesian inference in large datasets, showcased in a case study investigating a criminal network's structure.

Abstract: Ordinal categorical data are routinely encountered in a wide range of practical applications. When the primary goal is to construct a regression model for ordinal outcomes, cumulative link models represent one of the most popular choices to link the cumulative probabilities of the response with a set of covariates through a parsimonious linear predictor, shared across response categories. When the number of observations grows, standard sampling algorithms for Bayesian inference scale poorly, making posterior computation increasingly challenging in large datasets. In this article, we propose three scalable algorithms for approximating the posterior distribution of the regression coefficients in cumulative probit models relying on Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation. We compare the proposed approaches with inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo, demonstrating superior computational performance and remarkable accuracy; finally, we illustrate the utility of the proposed algorithms on a challenging case study to investigate the structure of a criminal network.

Main category: q-fin.ST

TL;DR: The paper reviews the evolution and advancements in probabilistic electricity price forecasting methods, emphasizing recent techniques and challenges like uncertainty estimation and lack of standardized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing volatility and uncertainty in energy markets due to the integration of renewable energy sources and regulatory changes, highlighting the necessity for advanced probabilistic forecasting rather than traditional point forecasting.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive review of probabilistic forecasting approaches, from Bayesian and distribution-based methods to recent progress in conformal prediction, focusing on different market types like Day-Ahead, Intra-Day, and Balancing Markets.

Result: The work highlights advancements in forecasting methods, such as validity-focused techniques, and identifies challenges including the absence of standardized benchmarks and difficulties in model selection.

Conclusion: The review provides a valuable resource on probabilistic forecasting for evolving electricity markets, addressing ongoing challenges and offering guidance for researchers and practitioners in decision-making and risk management.

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting has become a critical tool for decision-making in energy markets, particularly as the increasing penetration of renewable energy introduces greater volatility and uncertainty. Historically, research in this field has been dominated by point forecasting methods, which provide single-value predictions but fail to quantify uncertainty. However, as power markets evolve due to renewable integration, smart grids, and regulatory changes, the need for probabilistic forecasting has become more pronounced, offering a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment and market participation. This paper presents a review of probabilistic forecasting methods, tracing their evolution from Bayesian and distribution based approaches, through quantile regression techniques, to recent developments in conformal prediction. Particular emphasis is placed on advancements in probabilistic forecasting, including validity-focused methods which address key limitations in uncertainty estimation. Additionally, this review extends beyond the Day-Ahead Market to include the Intra-Day and Balancing Markets, where forecasting challenges are intensified by higher temporal granularity and real-time operational constraints. We examine state of the art methodologies, key evaluation metrics, and ongoing challenges, such as forecast validity, model selection, and the absence of standardised benchmarks, providing researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive and timely resource for navigating the complexities of modern electricity markets.

### [684] [Social-Physical Interactions with Virtual Characters: Evaluating the Impact of Physicality through Encountered-Type Haptics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05683)
*Eric Godden,Jacquie Groenewegen,Michael Wheeler,Matthew K. X. J. Pan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper studies how adding physical interactions, via a device called ETHOS, to VR experiences affects user perception, showing that increased physicality enhances presence, realism, enjoyment, and connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role and impact of physical interactions facilitated by haptic technology on social-physical interactions in virtual environments, aiming to improve user experience in VR.

Method: The study uses ETHOS, a haptic display with interchangeable props and a torque-controlled manipulator, to introduce three interaction types in VR: handovers, fist bumps, and high fives. It evaluates the user experience under three conditions: no physicality, static physicality, and dynamic physicality.

Result: The study found that presence, realism, enjoyment, and connection consistently improved as physicality increased from no physicality to dynamic physicality. However, the differences between static and dynamic physicality were minimal. Comfort remained unaffected.

Conclusion: ETHOS successfully enhances the perception of social-physical interactions in VR by adding physicality, validating the potential of encountered-type haptics for creating meaningful and enjoyable VR experiences.

Abstract: This work investigates how robot-mediated physicality influences the perception of social-physical interactions with virtual characters. ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social interaction) is an encountered-type haptic display that integrates a torque-controlled manipulator and interchangeable props with a VR headset to enable three gestures: object handovers, fist bumps, and high fives. We conducted a user study to examine how ETHOS adds physicality to virtual character interactions and how this affects presence, realism, enjoyment, and connection metrics. Each participant experienced one interaction under three conditions: no physicality (NP), static physicality (SP), and dynamic physicality (DP). SP extended the purely virtual baseline (NP) by introducing tangible props for direct contact, while DP further incorporated motion and impact forces to emulate natural touch. Results show presence increased stepwise from NP to SP to DP. Realism, enjoyment, and connection also improved with added physicality, though differences between SP and DP were not significant. Comfort remained consistent across conditions, indicating no added psychological friction. These findings demonstrate the experiential value of ETHOS and motivate the integration of encountered-type haptics into socially meaningful VR experiences.

TL;DR: The paper discusses creating benchmarks for generative AI systems, particularly focusing on journalism, addressing validity concerns through a human-centered, domain-oriented approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses criticisms on the validity of benchmark scores in evaluating generative AI systems and seeks to improve construct and ecological validity by focusing on journalism practitioners.

Method: A human-centered approach is adopted. Through a workshop with 23 journalism professionals, specific challenges and opportunities are identified, which inform the design of a domain-oriented benchmark.

Result: Insights from the workshop shaped a benchmark design tuned for journalism practices, addressing both validity concerns and domain-specific challenges.

Conclusion: The study provides design guidance for creating more effective benchmarks tailored to specific domains, enhancing their relevance and accuracy.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a significant role in how researchers and the public understand generative AI systems. However, the widespread use of benchmark scores to communicate about model capabilities has led to criticisms of validity, especially whether benchmarks test what they claim to test (i.e. construct validity) and whether benchmark evaluations are representative of how models are used in the wild (i.e. ecological validity). In this work we explore how to create an LLM benchmark that addresses these issues by taking a human-centered approach. We focus on designing a domain-oriented benchmark for journalism practitioners, drawing on insights from a workshop of 23 journalism professionals. Our workshop findings surface specific challenges that inform benchmark design opportunities, which we instantiate in a case study that addresses underlying criticisms and specific domain concerns. Through our findings and design case study, this work provides design guidance for developing benchmarks that are better tuned to specific domains.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AdvisingWise automates time-consuming academic advising tasks using AI while maintaining human oversight, enhancing efficiency and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High student-to-advisor ratios hinder timely academic advising, especially during peak times; thus, the paper explores AI solutions to support this process.

Method: The study introduces AdvisingWise, a multi-agent system utilizing LLMs for personalized, reliable responses validated by human advisors before delivery.

Result: Evaluation demonstrates AdvisingWise's ability to generate accurate responses, and academic advisors reported improved perceptions after system use.

Conclusion: AdvisingWise highlights the potential of human-AI collaboration to advance the effectiveness of academic advising practices.

Abstract: Academic advising is critical to student success in higher education, yet high student-to-advisor ratios limit advisors' capacity to provide timely support, particularly during peak periods. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) present opportunities to enhance the advising process. We present AdvisingWise, a multi-agent system that automates time-consuming tasks, such as information retrieval and response drafting, while preserving human oversight. AdvisingWise leverages authoritative institutional resources and adaptively prompts students about their academic backgrounds to generate reliable, personalized responses. All system responses undergo human advisor validation before delivery to students. We evaluate AdvisingWise through a mixed-methods approach: (1) expert evaluation on responses of 20 sample queries, (2) LLM-as-a-judge evaluation of the information retrieval strategy, and (3) a user study with 8 academic advisors to assess the system's practical utility. Our evaluation shows that AdvisingWise produces accurate, personalized responses. Advisors reported increasingly positive perceptions after using AdvisingWise, as their initial concerns about reliability and personalization diminished. We conclude by discussing the implications of human-AI synergy on the practice of academic advising.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can better support youth mental well-being through meaningful personalization informed by lived experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Youth increasingly use LLMs for mental well-being support, but current personalization methods often fail to account for diverse lived experiences.

Method: A participatory study involving youth, parents, and youth care workers (N=38) utilized co-created personas to derive community perspectives on effective support personalization.

Result: Three key themes were identified for meaningful personalization: responsive contextualization, clear boundaries around scope and offline referrals, and scaffolding for reflection and autonomy. These were mapped to design features and dialogue models for LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Lived experiences can be effectively translated into design elements for LLMs, improving alignment with youth needs and creating more personalized digital mental well-being tools.

Abstract: Youth increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for mental well-being support, yet current personalization in LLMs can overlook the heterogeneous lived experiences shaping their needs. We conducted a participatory study with youth, parents, and youth care workers (N=38), using co-created youth personas as scaffolds, to elicit community perspectives on how LLMs can facilitate more meaningful personalization to support youth mental well-being. Analysis identified three themes: person-centered contextualization responsive to momentary needs, explicit boundaries around scope and offline referral, and dialogic scaffolding for reflection and autonomy. We mapped these themes to persuasive design features for task suggestions, social facilitation, and system trustworthiness, and created corresponding dialogue extracts to guide LLM fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate how lived experience can be operationalized to inform design features in LLMs, which can enhance the alignment of LLM-based interventions with the realities of youth and their communities, contributing to more effectively personalized digital well-being tools.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human-Layer AI (HL-AI), a browser-based intermediary offering users control over social platforms by implementing safety-focused tools without needing platform cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current social media algorithms prioritize engagement over user well-being, leading to stress, misinformation, and loss of user control.

Method: Developed a prototype for Chrome/Edge with five features: Context-Aware Post Rewriter, Post Integrity Meter, Granular Feed Curator, Micro-Withdrawal Agent, and Recovery Mode; introduced a mathematical framework balancing utility, autonomy, and risk.

Result: The prototype enhances user control, safety, and well-being by addressing harmful engagement patterns while allowing explanations and user override options.

Conclusion: HL-AI provides practical tools to improve social media experiences, combining safety, well-being, and user agency, and calls for cross-cultural user evaluation.

Abstract: Social platforms connect billions of people, yet their engagement-first algorithms often work on users rather than with them, amplifying stress, misinformation, and a loss of control. We propose Human-Layer AI (HL-AI)--user-owned, explainable intermediaries that sit in the browser between platform logic and the interface. HL-AI gives people practical, moment-to-moment control without requiring platform cooperation. We contribute a working Chrome/Edge prototype implementing five representative pattern frameworks--Context-Aware Post Rewriter, Post Integrity Meter, Granular Feed Curator, Micro-Withdrawal Agent, and Recovery Mode--alongside a unifying mathematical formulation balancing user utility, autonomy costs, and risk thresholds. Evaluation spans technical accuracy, usability, and behavioral outcomes. The result is a suite of humane controls that help users rewrite before harm, read with integrity cues, tune feeds with intention, pause compulsive loops, and seek shelter during harassment, all while preserving agency through explanations and override options. This prototype offers a practical path to retrofit today's feeds with safety, agency, and well-being, inviting rigorous cross-cultural user evaluation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper systematizes architectural RowHammer (RH) defenses using streaming algorithms, offering a taxonomy of 48 studies and two practical guides for researchers and practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the fragmented field of architectural RH defenses by creating a unified taxonomy and providing guidance for enhancing RH security.

Method: The paper maps architectural RH defenses to classical streaming algorithms, introduces new mathematical security approaches like StickySampling, and offers practitioner guides for better solutions.

Result: The authors provide a comprehensive taxonomy of 48 RH defenses, demonstrate improvements using algorithms like Reservoir-Sampling, and propose StickySampling for stronger mathematical security.

Conclusion: This work organizes and streams RH defenses into a cohesive framework, providing direction for scalable and secure future solutions.

Abstract: A decade after its academic introduction, RowHammer (RH) remains a moving target that continues to challenge both the industry and academia. With its potential to serve as a critical attack vector, the ever-decreasing RH threshold now threatens DRAM process technology scaling, with a superlinearly increasing cost of RH protection solutions. Due to their generality and relatively lower performance costs, architectural RH solutions are the first line of defense against RH. However, the field is fragmented with varying views of the problem, terminologies, and even threat models.
  In this paper, we systematize architectural RH defenses from the last decade through the lens of streaming algorithms. We provide a taxonomy that encompasses 48 different works. We map multiple architectural RH defenses to the classical streaming algorithms, which extends to multiple proposals that did not identify this link. We also provide two practitioner guides. The first guide analyzes which algorithm best fits a given RHTH, location, process technology, storage type, and mitigative action. The second guide encourages future research to consult existing algorithms when architecting RH defenses. We illustrate this by demonstrating how Reservoir-Sampling can improve related RH defenses, and also introduce StickySampling that can provide mathematical security that related studies do not guarantee.

*Mohammad Farhad,Sabbir Rahman,Shuvalaxmi Dass*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents HYDRA, an advanced method combining heuristics and deep learning to predict latent zero-day vulnerabilities in patched software functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models often fail to uncover latent vulnerabilities in source code post patching, which can lead to zero-day exploits.

Method: HYDRA integrates rule-based heuristics, GraphCodeBERT embeddings, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to detect latent risky code patterns in patched functions.

Result: HYDRA successfully predicted latent vulnerabilities in 13.7%, 20.6%, and 24% of functions in Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: HYDRA enhances software security testing by detecting hidden risks missed by traditional symbolic or neural approaches, aiding proactive zero-day vulnerability discovery.

Abstract: Software security testing, particularly when enhanced with deep learning models, has become a powerful approach for improving software quality, enabling faster detection of known flaws in source code. However, many approaches miss post-fix latent vulnerabilities that remain even after patches typically due to incomplete fixes or overlooked issues may later lead to zero-day exploits. In this paper, we propose $HYDRA$, a $Hy$brid heuristic-guided $D$eep $R$epresentation $A$rchitecture for predicting latent zero-day vulnerabilities in patched functions that combines rule-based heuristics with deep representation learning to detect latent risky code patterns that may persist after patches. It integrates static vulnerability rules, GraphCodeBERT embeddings, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to uncover anomalies often missed by symbolic or neural models alone. We evaluate HYDRA in an unsupervised setting on patched functions from three diverse real-world software projects: Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick. Our results show HYDRA predicts 13.7%, 20.6%, and 24% of functions from Chrome, Android, and ImageMagick respectively as containing latent risks, including both heuristic matches and cases without heuristic matches ($None$) that may lead to zero-day vulnerabilities. It outperforms baseline models that rely solely on regex-derived features or their combination with embeddings, uncovering truly risky code variants that largely align with known heuristic patterns. These results demonstrate HYDRA's capability to surface hidden, previously undetected risks, advancing software security validation and supporting proactive zero-day vulnerabilities discovery.

Motivation: Current approaches to safety alignment in LLMs oversimplify the complex mechanisms of harm detection and refusal execution, leading to limitations in intervention and control.

Method: The researchers proposed a two-directional representation of safety alignment (Harm Detection Direction and Refusal Execution Direction) and introduced DBDI, utilizing adaptive projection nullification and direct steering techniques to neutralize safety layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show DBDI achieves up to a 97.88% attack success rate in bypassing safety mechanisms on models like Llama-2, outperforming existing jailbreaking methods.

Conclusion: DBDI provides a detailed mechanistic framework for understanding and intervening in LLM safety alignment, opening avenues for more granular control and improvement in model security.

Abstract: Safety alignment instills in Large Language Models (LLMs) a critical capacity to refuse malicious requests. Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.

### [693] [MCP-RiskCue: Can LLM infer risk information from MCP server System Logs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05867)
*Jiayi Fu,Qiyao Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a synthetic benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) in identifying security risks in system logs generated by malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. They present RL-based methods for improving detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to detect security vulnerabilities in logs of malicious MCP servers and improve model safety for tool-integrated interactions.

Method: The authors create a benchmark using 1,800 synthetic system logs generated by LLMs within nine categories of risks. These are embedded in 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 evaluation queries. They test supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning methods, specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Models trained with GRPO, such as Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, achieved a significantly better accuracy (83%) compared to others. Supervised fine-tuned models over-flag risks, while GRPO provides a better balance between precision and recall.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning methods, particularly GRPO, are effective in fine-tuning LLMs for higher accuracy in identifying security risks in MCP contexts. The benchmark validates these approaches and provides a dataset for ongoing research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in solving complex tasks when integrated with external tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has become a standard interface for enabling such tool-based interactions. However, these interactions introduce substantial security concerns, particularly when the MCP server is compromised or untrustworthy. While prior benchmarks primarily focus on prompt injection attacks or analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM MCP interaction trajectories, limited attention has been given to the underlying system logs associated with malicious MCP servers. To address this gap, we present the first synthetic benchmark for evaluating LLMs ability to identify security risks from system logs. We define nine categories of MCP server risks and generate 1,800 synthetic system logs using ten state-of-the-art LLMs. These logs are embedded in the return values of 243 curated MCP servers, yielding a dataset of 2,421 chat histories for training and 471 queries for evaluation. Our pilot experiments reveal that smaller models often fail to detect risky system logs, leading to high false negatives. While models trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) tend to over-flag benign logs, resulting in elevated false positives, Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) offers a better precision-recall balance. In particular, after training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct achieves 83% accuracy, surpassing the best-performing large remote model by 9 percentage points. Fine-grained, per-category analysis further underscores the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in enhancing LLM safety within the MCP framework.

### [694] [Injecting Falsehoods: Adversarial Man-in-the-Middle Attacks Undermining Factual Recall in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05919)
*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Yuxiao Li,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Xmera framework for evaluating LLM vulnerability to adversarial attacks, achieving up to 85.3% attack success and proposing a defense mechanism with ~96% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent concerns about LLM vulnerability to adversarial attacks, especially during question-answering, necessitate a robust evaluation framework for assessing and mitigating risks.

Method: The Xmera framework perturbs inputs in closed-book, fact-based QA tests to assess LLM factual memory vulnerability under prompt injection and develops Random Forest-based uncertainty detection for defense.

Result: Trivial instruction-based attacks show high success (up to ~85.3%), while Random Forest classifiers can identify attacks with an AUC of ~96% based on response uncertainty.

Conclusion: Highlighting LLM susceptibility to adversarial attacks, this study emphasizes caution and proposes uncertainty-based defenses as a step toward safer user interaction.

Abstract: LLMs are now an integral part of information retrieval. As such, their role as question answering chatbots raises significant concerns due to their shown vulnerability to adversarial man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Here, we propose the first principled attack evaluation on LLM factual memory under prompt injection via Xmera, our novel, theory-grounded MitM framework. By perturbing the input given to "victim" LLMs in three closed-book and fact-based QA settings, we undermine the correctness of the responses and assess the uncertainty of their generation process. Surprisingly, trivial instruction-based attacks report the highest success rate (up to ~85.3%) while simultaneously having a high uncertainty for incorrectly answered questions. To provide a simple defense mechanism against Xmera, we train Random Forest classifiers on the response uncertainty levels to distinguish between attacked and unattacked queries (average AUC of up to ~96%). We believe that signaling users to be cautious about the answers they receive from black-box and potentially corrupt LLMs is a first checkpoint toward user cyberspace safety.

### [695] [Enhancing Adversarial Robustness of IoT Intrusion Detection via SHAP-Based Attribution Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06197)
*Dilli Prasad Sharma,Liang Xue,Xiaowei Sun,Xiaodong Lin,Pulei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a robust IDS for IoT networks using SHAP-based fingerprinting to detect adversarial attacks, improving both security and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of IoT networks has led to sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting ML-based IDS, necessitating more resilient detection methods.

Method: The researchers use SHAP's DeepExplainer to extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic, enabling the IDS to reliably identify adversarial and clean inputs.

Result: Evaluation on a benchmark IoT dataset shows the model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed model not only enhances the robustness and detection of adversarial attacks but also improves interpretability and trust in IDS through explainable AI.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed numerous industries by enabling seamless connectivity and data-driven automation. However, this expansion has also exposed IoT networks to increasingly sophisticated security threats, including adversarial attacks targeting artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) to deliberately evade detection, induce misclassification, and systematically undermine the reliability and integrity of security defenses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel adversarial detection model that enhances the robustness of IoT IDS against adversarial attacks through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based fingerprinting. Using SHAP's DeepExplainer, we extract attribution fingerprints from network traffic features, enabling the IDS to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarially perturbed inputs. By capturing subtle attribution patterns, the model becomes more resilient to evasion attempts and adversarial manipulations. We evaluated the model on a standard IoT benchmark dataset, where it significantly outperformed a state-of-the-art method in detecting adversarial attacks. In addition to enhanced robustness, this approach improves model transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing trust in the IDS through explainable AI.

### [696] [When AI Meets the Web: Prompt Injection Risks in Third-Party AI Chatbot Plugins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05797)
*Yigitcan Kaya,Anton Landerer,Stijn Pletinckx,Michelle Zimmermann,Christopher Kruegel,Giovanni Vigna*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a large-scale study on vulnerabilities of third-party chatbot plugins, highlighting their exposure to prompt injection attacks and insecure practices undermining LLM safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks are well-known threats to LLMs, yet the risks associated with simpler LLM applications like customer service chatbots remain largely unexplored. These applications often rely on third-party chatbot plugins, whose security vulnerabilities are critical to address.

Method: The authors examine 17 third-party chatbot plugins used by over 10,000 websites. They evaluate vulnerabilities related to conversation history integrity and website content scraping via systematic experiments grounded in real-world observations.

Result: The study uncovered vulnerabilities including failure to enforce conversation history integrity in 8 plugins (used by 8,000 websites), amplifying prompt injection risks. Additionally, 15 plugins enriched chatbots' context with potentially untrusted content, putting ~13% of e-commerce websites at indirect prompt injection risk.

Conclusion: Third-party chatbot plugins widely used in LLM applications adopt insecure practices, increasing the susceptibility to direct and indirect prompt injection attacks and compromising their built-in LLM safeguards.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat to large language models (LLMs), with prior work focusing on cutting-edge LLM applications like personal copilots. In contrast, simpler LLM applications, such as customer service chatbots, are widespread on the web, yet their security posture and exposure to such attacks remain poorly understood. These applications often rely on third-party chatbot plugins that act as intermediaries to commercial LLM APIs, offering non-expert website builders intuitive ways to customize chatbot behaviors. To bridge this gap, we present the first large-scale study of 17 third-party chatbot plugins used by over 10,000 public websites, uncovering previously unknown prompt injection risks in practice. First, 8 of these plugins (used by 8,000 websites) fail to enforce the integrity of the conversation history transmitted in network requests between the website visitor and the chatbot. This oversight amplifies the impact of direct prompt injection attacks by allowing adversaries to forge conversation histories (including fake system messages), boosting their ability to elicit unintended behavior (e.g., code generation) by 3 to 8x. Second, 15 plugins offer tools, such as web-scraping, to enrich the chatbot's context with website-specific content. However, these tools do not distinguish the website's trusted content (e.g., product descriptions) from untrusted, third-party content (e.g., customer reviews), introducing a risk of indirect prompt injection. Notably, we found that ~13% of e-commerce websites have already exposed their chatbots to third-party content. We systematically evaluate both vulnerabilities through controlled experiments grounded in real-world observations, focusing on factors such as system prompt design and the underlying LLM. Our findings show that many plugins adopt insecure practices that undermine the built-in LLM safeguards.

*Haichao Zhang,Chong Zhang,Peiyu Hu,Shi Qiu,Jia Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CRAGRU addresses unlearning challenges in recommender systems, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to minimize propagation bias and preserve recommendation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure compliance with privacy regulations like the 'right to be forgotten,' modern recommender systems need a way to remove a user's data without disrupting recommendations for others.

Method: CRAGRU employs a RAG-based framework, with distinct stages for retrieval and generation. It isolates a user's data influence during retrieval and reconstructs accurate recommendations via LLM-enhanced prompts.

Result: CRAGRU successfully unlearns user data while maintaining recommendation accuracy, effectively mitigating unlearning bias in experiments on three public datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates RAG-based architectures as promising solutions for developing privacy-focused and efficient recommender systems.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems face a critical challenge in complying with privacy regulations like the 'right to be forgotten': removing a user's data without disrupting recommendations for others. Traditional unlearning methods address this by partial model updates, but introduce propagation bias--where unlearning one user's data distorts recommendations for behaviorally similar users, degrading system accuracy. While retraining eliminates bias, it is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. To address this challenge, we propose CRAGRU, a novel framework leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient, user-specific unlearning that mitigates bias while preserving recommendation quality. CRAGRU decouples unlearning into distinct retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, we employ three tailored strategies designed to precisely isolate the target user's data influence, minimizing collateral impact on unrelated users and enhancing unlearning efficiency. Subsequently, the generation stage utilizes an LLM, augmented with user profiles integrated into prompts, to reconstruct accurate and personalized recommendations without needing to retrain the entire base model. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CRAGRU effectively unlearns targeted user data, significantly mitigating unlearning bias by preventing adverse impacts on non-target users, while maintaining recommendation performance comparable to fully trained original models. Our work highlights the promise of RAG-based architectures for building robust and privacy-preserving recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces IMDMR, a multi-dimensional memory retrieval system, significantly improving conversational AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational AI systems often falter in maintaining contextual memory during extended dialogues, limiting personalization and relevance.

Method: IMDMR utilizes six memory dimensions—semantic, entity, category, intent, context, and temporal—and employs strategies like dynamic query processing and advanced memory integration.

Result: IMDMR outperforms five baseline systems (3.8x improvement), with effective ablation demonstrating 23.3% better results versus single-dimension memory approaches.

Conclusion: IMDMR offers robust advancements in conversational AI memory retrieval, supporting improved interactions and personalization.

Abstract: Conversational AI systems often struggle with maintaining coherent, contextual memory across extended interactions, limiting their ability to provide personalized and contextually relevant responses. This paper presents IMDMR (Intelligent Multi-Dimensional Memory Retrieval), a novel system that addresses these limitations through a multi-dimensional search architecture. Unlike existing memory systems that rely on single-dimensional approaches, IMDMR leverages six distinct memory dimensions-semantic, entity, category, intent, context, and temporal-to provide comprehensive memory retrieval capabilities. Our system incorporates intelligent query processing with dynamic strategy selection, cross-memory entity resolution, and advanced memory integration techniques. Through comprehensive evaluation against five baseline systems including LangChain RAG, LlamaIndex, MemGPT, and spaCy + RAG, IMDMR achieves a 3.8x improvement in overall performance (0.792 vs 0.207 for the best baseline). We present both simulated (0.314) and production (0.792) implementations, demonstrating the importance of real technology integration while maintaining superiority over all baseline systems. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-dimensional search, with the full system outperforming individual dimension approaches by 23.3%. Query-type analysis reveals superior performance across all categories, particularly for preferences/interests (0.630) and goals/aspirations (0.630) queries. Comprehensive visualizations and statistical analysis confirm the significance of these improvements with p < 0.001 across all metrics. The results establish IMDMR as a significant advancement in conversational AI memory systems, providing a robust foundation for enhanced user interactions and personalized experiences.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel explainability method in biomedical hypothesis generation, integrating semantic graph-based retrieval and LLMs to provide context-backed explanations using scientific literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of providing clear, contextualized explanations in biomedical hypothesis generation systems, enhancing their real-world applicability.

Method: The authors developed a semantic graph-based retrieval framework named HGCR, combined it with large language models through retrieval-augmented generation, and included a feedback loop for iterative improvement of explanations.

Result: Tests with different LLMs proved the system effectively explained hypotheses and improved explanation quality, evaluated through expert reviews and automated methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables more accurate and contextually supported hypothesis explanations in the biomedical domain, improving understanding and discovery processes.

Abstract: We introduce an explainability method for biomedical hypothesis generation systems, built on top of the novel Hypothesis Generation Context Retriever framework. Our approach combines semantic graph-based retrieval and relevant data-restrictive training to simulate real-world discovery constraints. Integrated with large language models (LLMs) via retrieval-augmented generation, the system explains hypotheses with contextual evidence using published scientific literature. We also propose a novel feedback loop approach, which iteratively identifies and corrects flawed parts of LLM-generated explanations, refining both the evidence paths and supporting context. We demonstrate the performance of our method with multiple large language models and evaluate the explanation and context retrieval quality through both expert-curated assessment and large-scale automated analysis.

*Rafayel Latif,Satwik Behera,Ali Al-Ebrahim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper examines personal recommendation models using weightless neural networks (WNNs) for real-time learning on per-user data, contrasting them with traditional methods to achieve competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional recommenders often struggle with adapting to real-time user feedback due to reliance on pre-trained systems. There's a need for systems that offer transparency and adaptability.

Method: Authors propose using weightless neural networks (WNNs) that learn continuously via state machines rather than backpropagation. They contrast this with standard collaborative filtering and classic weighted systems on per-user data.

Result: The method using WNNs demonstrated competitive accuracy when tested on a subset of the MovieLens dataset compared to traditional systems.

Conclusion: Weightless systems can supplement centralized recommendation systems, providing greater tunability for end-users and improved subjective accuracy.

Abstract: Given that conventional recommenders, while deeply effective, rely on large distributed systems pre-trained on aggregate user data, incorporating new data necessitates large training cycles, making them slow to adapt to real-time user feedback and often lacking transparency in recommendation rationale. We explore the performance of smaller personal models trained on per-user data using weightless neural networks (WNNs), an alternative to neural backpropagation that enable continuous learning by using neural networks as a state machine rather than a system with pretrained weights. We contrast our approach against a classic weighted system, also on a per-user level, and standard collaborative filtering, achieving competitive levels of accuracy on a subset of the MovieLens dataset. We close with a discussion of how weightless systems can be developed to augment centralized systems to achieve higher subjective accuracy through recommenders more directly tunable by end-users.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper explores predicting Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oscar nominations significantly impact the visibility and success of movies, prompting the study of whether nominations can be predicted using text features from screenplays.

Method: A new dataset (Movie-O-Label) was created combining movie scripts and Oscar records. Screenplays were represented by their title, summary, and full script, encoded using the E5 sentence embedding model, and classified through logistic regression.

Result: The best-performing model combined three screenplay features and achieved metrics including a macro F1 score of 0.66, precision recall AP of 0.445 (baseline 0.19), and ROC-AUC of 0.79.

Conclusion: Modern text embeddings and simple models can predict Oscar nominations with reasonable accuracy, offering potential for further research in the field.

Abstract: Oscar nominations are an important factor in the movie industry because they can boost both the visibility and the commercial success. This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model. The best results were achieved when three feature inputs related to screenplays (script, summary, and title) were combined. The best-performing model reached a macro F1 score of 0.66, a precision recall AP of 0.445 with baseline 0.19 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79. The results suggest that even simple models based on modern text embeddings demonstrate good prediction performance and might be a starting point for future research.

### [703] [A Representation Sharpening Framework for Zero Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05684)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Suraj Nair,Mutasem Al-Darabsah,Choon Hui Teo,Tarun Agarwal,Jonathan May*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a representation sharpening framework to enhance zero-shot dense retrieval by differentiating similar documents without additional training. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the BRIGHT benchmark across twenty datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot dense retrieval struggles without corpus-relevant training, leading to difficulties in distinguishing semantically similar documents. This paper aims to improve dense retrieval performance without training dependency.

Method: The framework sharpens document representations, augmenting each with unique differentiating information to improve retrieval performance. It is compatible with prior zero-shot approaches and includes a cost-efficient indexing-time approximation.

Result: Representation sharpening consistently outperforms traditional retrieval across twenty datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on the BRIGHT benchmark, and enhancing other zero-shot retrieval methods.

Conclusion: Representation sharpening improves zero-shot dense retrieval by differentiating semantically close documents, yielding superior results without requiring additional training, and offers a computationally efficient implementation.

Abstract: Zero-shot dense retrieval is a challenging setting where a document corpus is provided without relevant queries, necessitating a reliance on pretrained dense retrievers (DRs). However, since these DRs are not trained on the target corpus, they struggle to represent semantic differences between similar documents. To address this failing, we introduce a training-free representation sharpening framework that augments a document's representation with information that helps differentiate it from similar documents in the corpus. On over twenty datasets spanning multiple languages, the representation sharpening framework proves consistently superior to traditional retrieval, setting a new state-of-the-art on the BRIGHT benchmark. We show that representation sharpening is compatible with prior approaches to zero-shot dense retrieval and consistently improves their performance. Finally, we address the performance-cost tradeoff presented by our framework and devise an indexing-time approximation that preserves the majority of our performance gains over traditional retrieval, yet suffers no additional inference-time cost.

TL;DR: Large language models often suffer from retrieval issues for information located in the middle of long contexts. However, Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrates high accuracy in retrieving simple facts from documents even near the input limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address retrieval accuracy issues in long contexts, particularly the 'Lost in the Middle' effect reported in prior studies.

Method: The researchers evaluated the Gemini 2.5 Flash model's ability to retrieve factoid information within large contexts, including cases near the input limit.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Flash consistently retrieved accurate answers regardless of document position, demonstrating no 'Lost in the Middle' effect.

Conclusion: Gemini 2.5 Flash represents significant advancements in addressing long-context retrieval challenges for simple factoid Q&A tasks.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to recall and retrieve information from long contexts is critical for many real-world applications. Prior work (Liu et al., 2023) reported that LLMs suffer significant drops in retrieval accuracy for facts placed in the middle of large contexts, an effect known as "Lost in the Middle" (LITM). We find the model Gemini 2.5 Flash can answer needle-in-a-haystack questions with great accuracy regardless of document position including when the document is nearly at the input context limit. Our results suggest that the "Lost in the Middle" effect is not present for simple factoid Q\&A in Gemini 2.5 Flash, indicating substantial improvements in long-context retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the redundancy in multimodal item descriptions, complex sequential dependencies, and cognitive biases in multimodal large language models used for sequential recommendation.

Method: Speeder employs three components: Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), and Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO).

Result: Speeder outperformed baselines in VHR@1 and achieved 250% training speed and 400% inference speed improvements compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Speeder efficiently handles multimodal data for sequential recommendations, showcasing enhanced performance and suggesting future work on real-time feedback integration.

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed Speeder, a remarkably efficient paradigm to multimodal large language models for sequential recommendation. Speeder introduces 3 key components: (1) Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), which efficiently reduces redundancy in item descriptions; (2) Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), which strengthens the model's ability to capture complex sequential dependencies; (3) Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO), which progressively integrates different modalities to improve the model's understanding and reduce cognitive biases. Through extensive experiments, Speeder demonstrates superior performance over baselines in terms of VHR@1 and computational efficiency. Specifically, Speeder achieved 250% of the training speed and 400% of the inference speed compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM-based SR models. Future work could focus on incorporating real-time feedback from real-world systems.
