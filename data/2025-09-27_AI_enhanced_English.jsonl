However, even\nwell-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich\nenvironments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through\nretraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned\nskills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,\nfeasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of\nlearned robot policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces Latent Activation Editing (LAE) as a lightweight technique to improve the safety of reinforcement learning policies at inference time, reducing quadrotor collisions without modifying pre-trained policies.", "motivation": "To address safety vulnerabilities of reinforcement learning policies in obstacle-rich environments, especially without costly retraining or fine-tuning.", "method": "LAE operates by using an online classifier to detect risky behaviors in intermediate activations and an editing module to shift the policy toward safer actions.
