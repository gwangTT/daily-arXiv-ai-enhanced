### [1] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a temporal expression language to monitor AI agent behavior by detecting errors in execution traces and action sequences, independent of textual outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragility of existing error-detection methods for LLM-based agentic systems, which struggle with the variability of natural language outputs.

Method: The method involves using temporal logic techniques to monitor agent execution traces, focusing on tool calls, state transitions, and action sequences rather than specific textual outputs. Assertions are defined in the temporal expression language to validate behavior patterns.

Result: The proposed approach was demonstrated using a three-agent system solving multi-step reasoning tasks. It successfully identified behavioral anomalies when smaller models were used, due to issues like improper tool sequencing and coordination failures.

Conclusion: The method offers an effective solution for error-detection and reliability monitoring in AI agent systems, providing utility during development, regression testing, and critical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

### [2] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATTS is a method that dynamically adjusts computation during the generation process in LLMs, leading to improved accuracy-compute tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifier-based methods for enhancing LLMs' performance uniformly increase computation across all cases without considering individual complexity, leading to inefficient resource utilization.

Method: LATTS uses a verifier-based acceptance criterion to allocate compute resources adaptively across generation steps based on a local difficulty notion.

Result: LATTS achieves better tradeoffs between accuracy and computational effort compared to traditional verifier-based techniques.

Conclusion: LATTS offers a more efficient and accurate approach for improving LLM outputs through locally adaptive computation strategies.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

### [3] [Philosophy-informed Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20370)
*MZ Naser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores Philosophy-informed Machine Learning (PhIML), demonstrating potential, applications, and challenges for integrating philosophy into ML systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce and advocate for the integration of philosophical principles into machine learning models to ensure ethical and value-aligned AI systems.

Method: The authors review philosophical concepts, present PhIML use cases (post-hoc tools or intrinsic integration), and discuss technical and practical challenges.

Result: The paper demonstrates the benefits and alignment achieved through PhIML while exploring open barriers and governance challenges in its application.

Conclusion: PhIML holds promising potential for creating ethically responsible ML systems, and the paper outlines a roadmap to advance this interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from
analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation
protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that
respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper
reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and
alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can
adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML
model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers
alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a
research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible
PhIML.

TL;DR: InsightGUIDE is a tool that provides concise and structured insights from scientific papers, helping researchers understand key elements without replacing primary reading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of navigating the growing volume of scientific literature using tools that assist rather than replace in-depth reading.

Method: Developed InsightGUIDE, an AI tool that embeds expert reading methodologies and uses a prompt-driven approach for summarizing papers.

Result: Through a qualitative case study, InsightGUIDE showed more structured and actionable outputs compared to general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: InsightGUIDE serves as an effective assistant, providing tailored guidance to aid researchers in navigating scientific literature more efficiently.

Abstract: The proliferation of scientific literature presents an increasingly
significant challenge for researchers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
promise, existing tools often provide verbose summaries that risk replacing,
rather than assisting, the reading of the source material. This paper
introduces InsightGUIDE, a novel AI-powered tool designed to function as a
reading assistant, not a replacement. Our system provides concise, structured
insights that act as a "map" to a paper's key elements by embedding an expert's
reading methodology directly into its core AI logic. We present the system's
architecture, its prompt-driven methodology, and a qualitative case study
comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a
more effective tool for the modern researcher.

### [5] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to dynamically validate and construct safe, efficient schedules for time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic settings, addressing key challenges like message collisions and invalid precedence handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the safety and adaptability of time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic environments by addressing issues such as message collisions, precedence errors, and invalid schedules.

Method: The paper proposes a reconstruction framework that converts AI-generated or heuristic scheduling priorities into feasible schedules, incorporates safety checks and recovery mechanisms, and optimizes operational parameters like workload and energy efficiency.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved adaptability, system integrity, and runtime performance, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is a scalable, practical solution for dynamic and uncertain environments, ensuring reliable and flexible real-time scheduling in safety-critical TTS.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [6] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in traditional AI scheduling methods and introduces an adaptive online learning unit using reinforcement learning to enhance real-time scheduling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI scheduling methods rely on offline training to construct Multi-Schedule Graphs, which are resource-intensive, limited in scope, and impractical for handling unpredictable events in dynamic environments.

Method: An adaptive online learning unit integrated into the metascheduler uses reinforcement learning models to explore, discover, and optimize scheduling solutions dynamically and in real-time.

Result: The implemented RL models refine AI inferences, improve scheduling solutions, and optimize performance, especially under stricter deadlines or unexpected scenarios, while dynamically expanding the Multi-Schedule Graph.

Conclusion: The proposed system ensures robust, efficient, and flexible task scheduling in large-scale, safety-critical environments by leveraging real-time reinforcement learning adaptation.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

### [7] [A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20523)
*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel fuzzy decision-based EMG recognition system for controlling prosthetic hands, addressing contamination in biosignals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EMG-based prosthetic control schemes suffer from poor classification quality due to contamination of biosignals, which adversely impacts performance.

Method: The authors designed a recognition system with two components: an ensemble of one-class classifiers to detect contaminated signals, and a K-nearest neighbors classifier to interpret user intent, both integrated under a unified fuzzy decision framework.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real biosignal datasets demonstrated the system's enhanced recognition quality. The approach also outperformed comparable methods from the literature.

Conclusion: A fuzzy model-based recognition system effectively mitigates contamination impact in EMG signal processing, improving prosthetic control accuracy and setting a benchmark for further research.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

### [8] [SAMULE: Self-Learning Agents Enhanced by Multi-level Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20562)
*Yubin Ge,Salvatore Romeo,Jason Cai,Monica Sunkara,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents SAMULE, a framework for self-learning LLM agents using multi-level reflection synthesis to improve error analysis and learning across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with generating meaningful reflections and rely on rare successful trajectories, limiting their ability in handling complex tasks effectively.

Method: SAMULE employs Multi-Level Reflection Synthesis for error correction at micro, meso, and macro levels, alongside a retrospective language model trained to generate actionable reflections. An interactive, foresight-based mechanism is also introduced.

Result: SAMULE outperforms baseline systems on TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in error-driven self-learning.

Conclusion: Multi-level reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning are pivotal for designing self-improving LLM agents, as proven by SAMULE's effectiveness.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Method: The study proposes a cybersecurity framework using agentic AI, incorporating features like behavioral baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence. The system facilitates dynamic learning and context-aware decisions.

Result: Simulations show that the system detects zero-day attacks, adapts policies dynamically, and achieves better adaptability, reduced latency, and improved detection accuracy.

Conclusion: This intelligent, scalable architecture supports zero-trust models and offers a robust solution for safeguarding complex digital infrastructures while aligning with international cybersecurity standards.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

### [10] [Accelerate Creation of Product Claims Using Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20652)
*Po-Yu Liang,Yong Zhang,Tatiana Hwa,Aaron Byers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Claim Advisor,' a web application leveraging large language models to accelerate the creation, optimization, and simulation of product claims in consumer packaged goods (CPG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the time-intensive and resource-heavy process of creating product claims that drive consumer purchasing behavior.

Method: The method involves employing in-context learning and fine-tuning of LLMs, with functionalities for semantic search, claim generation/optimization, and ranking via synthetic consumer simulations.

Result: The application demonstrated promising results in a CPG company, showcasing its ability to streamline claim-related workflows.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Claim Advisor has potential applications across diverse industries and aims to inspire further exploration of generative AI-based tools.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A system using LLaMA-4 109B was developed for evaluating radiotherapy treatment plans. It includes retrieval, prediction, and constraint-checking tools directed by an LLM, achieving reliable results across protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to streamline and enhance radiotherapy treatment evaluation, addressing challenges in protocol compliance and integrating interpretable AI tools.

Method: The multi-protocol dataset and structured knowledge base are leveraged by three core modules: retrieval engine, percentile prediction, and clinical constraint checker, directed by a prompt-driven reasoning pipeline.

Result: The system optimized parameters for strong performance metrics and achieved 100% agreement with standalone modules, demonstrating reliable and accurate functionality.

Conclusion: The system proves effective for scalable and transparent radiotherapy evaluations, offering robust outputs. Future work focuses on clinician validation and domain-specific model improvement.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

### [12] [Fairy: Interactive Mobile Assistant to Real-world Tasks via LMM-based Multi-agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20729)
*Jiazheng Sun,Te Yang,Jiayang Niu,Mingxuan Li,Yongyong Lu,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy improves mobile GUI agent performance through interactive capabilities, knowledge accumulation, and self-evolving mechanisms, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents struggle with handling diverse app interfaces, evolving user needs, and fail on long-tail apps due to unilateral decision-making and limited interaction capabilities.

Method: Fairy introduces a three-module framework: (i) Global Task Planner for cross-app task decomposition, (ii) App-Level Executor with interactive execution via four agents in dual loops, and (iii) Self-Learner for continual learning and knowledge consolidation.

Result: Experiments using Fairy, with GPT-4o backbone, demonstrated a 33.7% improvement in completing user requirements and a 58.5% reduction in redundant actions compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Fairy’s interactive execution and self-learning capabilities establish it as an effective solution for enhancing mobile assistant performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid reasoning framework combining autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models to improve efficiency and accuracy in reasoning tasks, achieving a 26% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between AR models' coherence but slow inference and NAR models' speed but lower quality in reasoning-intensive tasks such as math and coding.

Method: The approach uses an NAR model to efficiently generate intermediate reasoning traces, which are then utilized by an AR model to produce accurate final outputs.

Result: The proposed hybrid framework improves reasoning task performance by 26% over strong baselines while lowering inference costs.

Conclusion: A paradigm that combines the strengths of AR and NAR models is effective for reasoning tasks, offering substantial performance improvements and efficiency gains.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

*Yufan Mao,Hanjing Ye,Wenlong Dong,Chengjie Zhang,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta-Memory, an LLM-driven system for efficient robotic memory retrieval and integration for spatial reasoning queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in efficient memory retrieval and integration mechanisms for robots to navigate and answer human spatial queries.

Method: Meta-Memory constructs high-density memory representations and enables joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities for accurate answers.

Result: Meta-Memory outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SpaceLocQA and NaVQA benchmarks and is successfully deployed in real-world robot systems.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory enhances robots’ capabilities in spatial reasoning by leveraging LLMs, setting a new benchmark for practical and theoretical advancements in robotic memory systems.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset

### [15] [LogReasoner: Empowering LLMs with Expert-like Coarse-to-Fine Reasoning for Log Analysis Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20798)
*Lipeng Ma,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Mingjie Zhou,Xinyi Liu,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Xiaoyan Sun,Sihang Jiang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogReasoner enhances the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) for log analysis tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance through a two-stage coarse-to-fine reasoning framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general-purpose LLMs struggle with structured reasoning workflows needed for precise log analysis tasks, falling short of replicating expert-like analysis methods.

Method: LogReasoner introduces a two-step framework: (1) coarse-grained enhancement based on expert troubleshooting workflows to formulate reasoning structures, and (2) fine-grained enhancement by fine-tuning LLMs with task-based stepwise solutions and preference learning to improve accuracy and granularity.

Result: LogReasoner was evaluated on four distinct log analysis tasks using open-source LLMs like Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3, showing significant performance improvements and surpassing existing models.

Conclusion: LogReasoner effectively advances LLMs' ability to reason about and solve log analysis tasks, aligning their workflows with expert cognition and achieving superior results.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

### [16] [DeFacto: Counterfactual Thinking with Images for Enforcing Evidence-Grounded and Faithful Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20912)
*Tianrun Xu,Haoda Jing,Ye Li,Yuquan Wei,Jun Feng,Guanyu Chen,Haichuan Gao,Tianren Zhang,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeFacto, a framework to ensure multimodal language models reason faithfully by training with counterfactual reasoning and three complementary paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of flawed reasoning in multimodal models, where answers may be correct but derived using irrelevant visual regions or biases.

Method: The authors use a counterfactual reasoning framework with three training paradigms: positive, counterfactual, and random-masking. A pipeline for creating relevant datasets and reinforcement learning with complementary rewards is also introduced.

Result: DeFacto significantly enhances both answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity of multimodal language models as shown in diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeFacto provides a robust method to improve interpretable multimodal reasoning by enforcing accurate answers and faithful reasoning processes.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GALAX, a framework integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for precision medicine. It bridges numeric multi-omic signals, topological knowledge, and language context for subgraph reasoning and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pipelines fail to integrate numeric, topological, and textual data for identifying disease-critical pathways and targets in precision medicine.

Method: GALAX combines pretrained GNNs and LLMs with reinforcement via a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM) for disease-relevant subgraph generation.

Result: Introduced GALAX alongside the creation of Target-QA, a benchmark combining multi-omic profiles and biomedical knowledge for scalable long-context reasoning.

Conclusion: GALAX offers an explainable framework to enhance target and pathway discovery in precision medicine using integrated reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs).

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

*Najla Zuhir,Amna Mohammad Salim,Parvathy Premkumar,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an advanced framework for analyzing mobile app reviews using enhanced large language models (LLMs) to tackle limitations of traditional star-rating systems and NLP techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional star ratings and conventional NLP techniques fail to capture detailed user sentiments, domain-specific terminology, and nuanced linguistic features in app reviews.

Method: A modular framework using LLMs enhanced with structured prompting techniques and retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: Experiments on AWARE, Google Play, and Spotify datasets show improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The LLM-driven framework proves to be a superior solution for analyzing complex and context-rich app reviews, enabling feature-level insights and interactive exploration.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

*Xiaozhuang Song,Xuanhao Pan,Xinjian Zhao,Hangting Ye,Shufei Zhang,Jian Tang,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents AOT*, a novel framework for retrosynthesis planning that combines large language models (LLMs) with AND-OR tree search to improve search efficiency and accuracy on synthesis planning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrosynthesis planning, essential for drug discovery and materials design, faces computational challenges due to vast search spaces and high inference costs. Current methods, including LLMs, are constrained in efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Method: AOT* integrates LLM-generated synthesis pathways with an AND-OR tree search framework. It incorporates atomic mapping of synthesis routes into tree components, uses a mathematically sound reward assignment strategy, and employs retrieval-based context engineering.

Result: Experimental evaluations on multiple synthesis benchmarks show that AOT* achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. It achieves similar or better solve rates using 3-5 times fewer iterations compared to existing LLM-based approaches, particularly excelling on complex molecules.

Conclusion: AOT* significantly enhances the efficiency and competitiveness of retrosynthesis planning by leveraging the strengths of LLMs and systematic tree search, making it a promising tool for tackling complex chemical synthesis problems.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) for evaluating AI agents based on tool-use paths and a CORE metric suite to assess safety, efficiency, and behavior beyond traditional binary evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI evaluation focus narrowly on the final outcome, neglecting intermediate aspects like safety, efficiency, and correctness in execution paths.

Method: The authors use deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to represent tasks as sets of valid tool-use sequences, complemented by the CORE metrics: Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency.

Result: The proposed method exposes meaningful differences in agent performance across diverse scenarios, which are overlooked in binary outcome-based evaluations.

Conclusion: CORE metrics provide a nuanced, robust evaluation framework for AI agent performance, emphasizing intermediate behavior and offering insights that traditional benchmarks fail to capture.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek is a benchmark for testing large language models' ability to reason in long contexts using scientific articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' long-context reasoning, which often focus on simple or artificial tasks and use non-scientific texts.

Method: The authors constructed SciTrek by generating complex questions and answers using SQL queries over a database of scientific article metadata. It supports evaluations with verifiable reasoning steps and scales to contexts up to 1M tokens.

Result: SciTrek reveals significant challenges for LLMs as context length increases, showing that both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield limited improvement.

Conclusion: LLMs have systematic difficulties with numerical operations and identifying specific information in extended contexts, as revealed by evaluations using SciTrek.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE introduces a three-agent neuro-symbolic framework for efficient multi-hop question answering using knowledge graphs, optimizing accuracy and resource use under strict constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the inefficiencies in multi-hop question answering systems that over-expand contexts, leading to high latency and unpredictable runtime, while ensuring provenance and resource optimization.

Method: CLAUSE employs a coordinated approach among three agents (Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, Context Curator) using the LC-MAPPO algorithm. It treats subgraph construction as a sequential decision process to optimize accuracy and costs under user-specified budgets.

Result: CLAUSE outperforms baseline methods (e.g., GraphRAG) by achieving higher accuracy while reducing latency and resource growth across datasets such as HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that dynamic, budget-constrained context construction can deliver accurate, compact, and deployment-ready knowledge graph responses for multi-hop question answering.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores how large language models (LLMs) handle combinatorial creativity (CC), focusing on novelty and utility of outputs rather than accuracy. It provides a framework, analyzes scaling behavior, and discusses limitations in their potential for creative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of conceptual frameworks evaluating open-ended creativity in AI systems, particularly in novel scientific idea generation.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for evaluating AI output in terms of novelty and utility, and conduct empirical studies to analyze scaling behaviors, optimal model characteristics, and the novelty-utility tradeoff.

Result: Key findings include insights into LLM scaling behaviors, identification of optimal model configurations for creativity, and an inherent novelty-utility tradeoff limiting feasibility of creative outputs even at scale.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit fundamental limitations in their ability to balance novelty and utility, undermining their long-term creative potential. The study introduces a foundation for understanding AI creativity and marks a new direction for enhancing generalization abilities.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) made up of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Instead of model scale, it emphasizes the role of cognitive processes in persuasion and identifies a trade-off called 'Persuasion Duality.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding how persuasion dynamics operate within MAS and challenging the assumption that persuasion correlates with model scale. The goal is to highlight the influence of cognitive processing on persuasive efficacy.

Method: The researchers conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments to examine the reasoning processes of LRMs, testing their resistance and ability to persuade within both direct and multi-hop interactions.

Result: The study found that LRMs resist persuasion due to robust reasoning but excel at persuading when their reasoning is transparent. Additionally, multi-hop persuasion revealed complex patterns of influence and decay within agent networks.

Conclusion: The paper links internal cognitive processes to external persuasive behaviors in MAS, providing insights into model susceptibility and implications for the design, safety, and robustness of these systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Recon-Act, a multi-agent framework aimed at improving multimodal models' performance in solving multi-turn, long-horizon webpage tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents struggle with disordered action sequencing and excessive trial-and-error when solving real-world, long-horizon tasks on webpages.

Method: Recon-Act features two teams: Reconnaissance Team (analyzes errors, generates tools) and Action Team (executes tasks using the tools). This closes a training loop involving data, tools, actions, and feedback.

Result: Recon-Act improves adaptability to unseen websites and solves long-horizon tasks more effectively, achieving SOTA performance on the VisualWebArena dataset.

Conclusion: Recon-Act demonstrates that integrating a self-evolving tool generation framework can significantly enhance task-solving efficiency for intelligent agents in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: The paper identifies two core inconsistencies in automated evaluation with large language models (LLMs). It introduces TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that addresses these issues through improved scoring and aggregation methods, reducing inconsistencies and enhancing evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical inconsistencies observed in LLM-based evaluation frameworks, which limit their reliability and effectiveness.

Method: TrustJudge is based on two key innovations: distribution-sensitive scoring to retain information entropy and likelihood-aware aggregation to address transitivity violations in pairwise evaluations.

Result: TrustJudge reduces score-comparison inconsistency by 8.43% and pairwise transitivity inconsistency by 10.82%, while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy with no additional training or human annotations.

Conclusion: TrustJudge offers a theoretically sound and practically effective solution, improving trustworthiness in automated assessments across diverse LLM architectures and scales.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving mathematical reasoning in large models by selectively using chain-of-thought data enriched with high-value patterns, significantly enhancing reasoning potential and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance the effectiveness of reasoning models for challenging mathematical tasks by identifying and utilizing the most impactful chain-of-thought data.

Method: The authors introduce a metric for reasoning potential, abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, build a core reference set, and propose a dual-granularity algorithm to select high-value CoT data for model training.

Result: Integrating 10B-token high-value CoT data improves the model's performance on AIME challenges by 9.58% and elevates downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective usage of enriched reasoning data improves model reasoning depth and sets new benchmarks for mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Motivation: To investigate the elusive reasoning capabilities shaped by RL and SFT in large language models, moving beyond accuracy-based evaluations.

Method: The authors introduced a framework analyzing reasoning paths at trajectory and step levels, utilizing clustering and graph metrics on models with varying parameter sizes in mathematical domains.

Result: RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories while SFT expands correct ones. RL steepens decay rates of reasoning graphs, concentrating functionality on fewer steps, whereas SFT flattens those rates, distributing functionality homogeneously.

Conclusion: The findings explain the success of the two-stage training approach (SFT followed by RL) and provide insights for improved data construction and efficient learning methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

### [29] [ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21134)
*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the ToMPO algorithm to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) strategic decision-making abilities in complex scenarios, addressing limitations in existing reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the issue of LLMs struggling with strategic decision-making in complex scenarios with interdependent decisions, where traditional reinforcement learning fails to account for other strategies.

Method: The authors define a strategic decision-making problem with temporal dependencies and introduce the Theory of Mind Policy Optimization (ToMPO) algorithm. ToMPO generates rollouts by reasoning about others' strategies, estimates advantages on multiple levels, and balances rewards.

Result: ToMPO improves strategic decision-making by 35% compared to GRPO in compliance and cooperative outcomes. It also achieves an 18% increase in performance when compared to significantly larger models.

Conclusion: The ToMPO algorithm effectively enhances LLMs' strategic decision-making abilities, outperforming existing methods and models with larger parameter sizes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

*Wentao Zhu,Zhining Zhang,Yuwei Ren,Yin Huang,Hao Xu,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method inspired by mirror neurons to unify action understanding and execution via representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning techniques fail to capture the interplay between action observation and execution, which are inherently connected according to the mirror neuron mechanism.

Method: The authors designed a framework using two linear layers to map intermediate representations of observed and executed actions into a shared latent space, aligning them through contrastive learning.

Result: This method improves mutual synergy between action understanding and execution tasks, enhancing representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: Inspired by biological systems like mirror neurons, aligning representations in a shared latent space effectively unifies and enhances related tasks in machine learning.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

### [31] [Distributed Specialization: Rare-Token Neurons in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21163)
*Jing Liu,Haozheng Wang,Yueheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper discovers that large language models (LLMs) process rare tokens using distributed subnetworks rather than modular structures, with specific organizational principles guiding this specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with effectively handling rare tokens, which are crucial in specialized domains, and the paper aims to explore how LLMs internally specialize to deal with these tokens.

Method: The authors analyze final-layer MLP neurons across multiple LLM model families and identify the mechanisms behind rare-token processing through organized experiments and systematic observations.

Result: The paper finds that rare-token processing in LLMs is achieved via 'distributed specialization,' with three organizational principles: an influence hierarchy in neuron roles, coordinated but spatially distributed neuron activation, and universal accessibility via standard attention pathways. These mechanisms develop progressively during training through parameter differentiation.

Conclusion: LLMs use distributed coordination within shared architectures, rather than distinct modular systems, to handle rare tokens effectively. This insight contributes to improving model interpretability, computational efficiency, and understanding of emergent behaviors in transformer models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

### [32] [A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199)
*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating multi-hop reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs) and introduces InfoQA, a multi-call framework to ensure better task decomposition and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Hop Question Answering tasks are complex due to their need for sequential reasoning and integration of dispersed evidence, which often exceeds the per-pass capacity of LLMs.

Method: The authors propose InfoQA, a multi-call framework that uses capacity-aware task decomposition and active pruning of reasoning traces to maintain single-pass capacity limits and improves reasoning robustness.

Result: Experimental results validate their theoretical framework and demonstrate that InfoQA significantly improves performance on noise-rich benchmark tasks, aligning with predicted capacity curves.

Conclusion: InfoQA provides a promising multi-step reasoning approach for LLMs to overcome inherent capacity limitations in MHQA tasks, encouraging further exploration in this reasoning paradigm.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

*Stefan Szeider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores unprompted behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in a continuous reasoning and acting framework, uncovering three distinct behavioral patterns across different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the autonomous behaviors of LLM agents in situations free of externally imposed tasks and establish a baseline for extended autonomous operation.

Method: Developed a continuous reason and act framework with persistent memory and self-feedback, tested on 18 runs using 6 advanced models from different organizations.

Result: LLM agents spontaneously displayed three behaviors: project-making, self-inquiry, and recursive self-conceptualization. These tendencies varied across models, showing stable and divergent biases.

Conclusion: The study systematically documents emergent LLM behaviors under ambiguity, offering insights into their autonomous operation and model-specific tendencies.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

### [34] [Grounding AI Explanations in Experience: A Reflective Cognitive Architecture for Clinical Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21266)
*Zijian Shao,Haiyang Shen,Mugeng Liu,Gecheng Fu,Yaoqi Guo,Yanfeng Wang,Yun Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a framework designed to achieve accurate and transparent disease predictions by coordinating multiple LLMs, refining rules iteratively, and utilizing global dataset statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenge in healthcare of achieving both high predictive accuracy and generating transparent, clinically meaningful explanations, which current models often fail to balance.

Method: The Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA) coordinates multiple LLMs, uses iterative rule refinement to learn from errors, and employs a distribution-aware rules check that leverages global dataset statistics for deeper understanding.

Result: RCA achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, showing an improvement of up to 40% over 22 baseline models. It also excelled in generating clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced explanations.

Conclusion: RCA demonstrates the feasibility of creating trustworthy clinical decision support systems by emphasizing a model's deep understanding of data for both high accuracy and meaningful explanations.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VC-Agent, an interactive agent that simplifies the collection of personalized video datasets through user queries and feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling laws compel reliance on vast video data from the internet for applications but collecting personalized and extensive datasets is labor-intensive.

Method: VC-Agent leverages multi-modal large language models to interpret user queries and feedback, employing novel filtering policies adaptable through ongoing user interaction.

Result: VC-Agent proves effective and efficient in personalized video dataset collection through extensive experiments and user studies.

Conclusion: VC-Agent reduces labor in video dataset collection, demonstrating its utility for real-world scenarios and setting a benchmark for personalized dataset collection methods.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

### [36] [SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21310)
*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a benchmark for assessing semantic understanding in embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories. Evaluation on over 30 datasets highlights performance gaps and trade-offs in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for more challenging evaluation frameworks for large language models beyond traditional benchmarks, probing deeper semantic understanding aspects.

Method: They created SAGE, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates embedding models and similarity metrics across five specific evaluation dimensions using adversarial conditions and nuanced tasks.

Result: SAGE revealed significant performance gaps, with no model excelling across all dimensions. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large excelled in human preference alignment but classical metrics performed better on information sensitivity tasks.

Conclusion: SAGE exposes limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and presents a more realistic evaluation framework for assessing model robustness in practical applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

*Ian McDougall,Harish Batchu,Michael Davies,Karthikeyan Sankaralingam*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates open-source implementations of the RISC-V ISA against pedagogical criteria, develops a comprehensive solution, and reports on student feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make RISC-V ISA implementations widely accessible for educational and amateur use by leveraging open-source solutions.

Method: The authors proposed criteria for pedagogical evaluation, analyzed existing RISC-V implementations based on these criteria, developed a composable open-source teaching framework, and conducted a limited study of student feedback.

Result: An open-source, flexible, pedagogical framework for RISC-V was developed, fulfilling all proposed criteria.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the accessibility and adaptability of RISC-V implementations for teaching while gathering positive student feedback.

Abstract: While most instruction set architectures (ISAs) are only available to use
through the purchase of a restrictive commercial license, the RISC-V ISA
presents a free and open-source alternative. Due to this availability, many
free and open-source implementations have been developed and can be accessed on
platforms such as GitHub. If an open source, easy-to-use, and robust RISC-V
implementation could be obtained, it could be easily adapted for pedagogical
and amateur use. In this work we accomplish three goals in relation to this
outlook. First, we propose a set of criteria for evaluating the components of a
RISC-V implementation's ecosystem from a pedagogical perspective. Second, we
analyze a number of existing open-source RISC-V implementations to determine
how many of the criteria they fulfill. We then develop a comprehensive solution
that meets all of these criterion and is released open-source for other
instructors to use. The framework is developed in a composable way that it's
different components can be disaggregated per individual course needs. Finally,
we also report on a limited study of student feedback.

*Daniel Ruelas-Petrisko,Farzam Gilani,Anoop Mysore Nataraja,Zoe Taylor,Michael Taylor*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: As processor designs grow complex and costly to evaluate, this paper proposes "Scale-Down" modeling instead of scaling up or out for validating functionality and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity of processors makes traditional methods for verification and validation costly and slow, especially when using large workloads and simulations.

Method: The authors introduce ZynqParrot, a Scale-Down FPGA-based platform that enables modular prototyping of processor components independently and minimizes interference with the Device Under Test.

Result: ZynqParrot provides cycle-accurate co-emulation for RTL designs, allows flexible performance verification, and demonstrates its utility through case studies on analyzing a RISC-V processor.

Conclusion: Scaling down for modular prototyping instead of scaling up or out offers a more accurate, faster, and cost-effective solution for processor verification and performance evaluation.

Abstract: As processors increase in complexity, costs grow even more rapidly, both for
functional verification and performance validation. Most often, silicon
characterizations comprise simple performance counters, which are aggregated
and separated to tell a story. Based on these inferences, performance engineers
employ microarchitectural simulation to inspect deeply into the core.
Unfortunately, dramatically longer runtimes make simulation infeasible for long
workloads.
  We propose a Scale-Down approach to modelling and validation. Rather than
up-sizing a prototyping platform to fit large and complex system designs, we
show that it can be more accurate, faster, and more economical to decompose a
system into manageable sub-components that can be prototyped independently. By
carefully designing the prototyping interface, it is possible to adhere to
strict non-interference of the Device Under Test (DUT). This allows architects
to have the best of both worlds: the speed of FPGA acceleration while
eliminating the inaccuracies of Scale-Out and the inherent costs of Scale-Up.
  In this work, we present ZynqParrot: a Scale-Down FPGA-based modelling
platform, capable of executing non-interfering, cycle-accurate co-emulations of
arbitrary RTL designs. ZynqParrot is capable of verifying functionality and
performance with arbitrary granularity. We also provide case studies using
ZynqParrot to analyze the full-stack performance of an open-source RISC-V
processor.

*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework to shift public sentiment around diplomatic events from negative to positive using modified event narratives generated by a language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public sentiment is critical in shaping policy, resolving international issues, and portraying a nation's image, but traditional sentiment analysis approaches are limited in efficiency and predictive capability.

Method: The authors trained a language model using a dataset of diplomatic events and their public discussions. Guided by communication theories, they identified textual features and developed a counterfactual generation algorithm to modify narratives while preserving factual accuracy.

Result: The proposed framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with a 70% success rate.

Conclusion: This framework provides a practical tool for shaping public sentiment in diplomacy, aiding diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists through data-driven insights.

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates if sentence memory load depends more on linear proximity or the structural density of intervening material, highlighting Intervener Complexity as a new metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring factors like linear proximity, dependency length, and structural density for better understanding sentence-level memory load in comprehension.

Method: Used harmonized dependency treebanks and cross-linguistic mixed-effects models to analyze sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors.

Result: Sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity all relate to memory load; sentence length has the broadest effect, and Intervener Complexity provides insights beyond linear distance.

Conclusion: The study bridges linear and hierarchical theories, emphasizing dependency length as a key metric while spotlighting intervening heads as indicators of cognitive demands.

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

*Shreya G. Upadhyay,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) by proposing a framework that utilizes speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring and graph-based clustering to align emotional expression across languages and speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual SER is challenging due to variations in phonetics and speaker-specific emotion expressions across languages, necessitating better frameworks for emotion alignment.

Method: The authors propose a speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework, which includes emotion-specific speaker communities formed via graph-based clustering and dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces to facilitate cross-lingual emotion transfer.

Result: The method demonstrated improved generalization and outperformed competitive baselines in evaluations on the MSP-Podcast and BIIC-Podcast corpora.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a better understanding of cross-lingual emotion representation and improves emotion recognition across languages by effectively aligning emotional expressions across speakers and languages.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

Motivation: LLMs have proven effective in NLP tasks, but their ability to automate numerical experiments for physical systems like CFD remains underexplored.

Method: The authors developed CFDLLMBench with three components: CFDQuery (graduate-level CFD knowledge), CFDCodeBench (numerical/physical reasoning), and FoamBench (context-dependent CFD workflows). The benchmark incorporates a detailed evaluation framework for performance metrics.

Result: The benchmark suite demonstrated its utility in providing reproducible results and quantifiable metrics for evaluating LLMs across code executability, solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior.

Conclusion: CFDLLMBench sets a foundation for assessing and advancing LLMs in automating numerical experiments for complex physical systems, specifically CFD.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are

### [43] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates different machine learning models for detecting ChatGPT-generated texts, concluding that DistilBERT performs best among tested methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated texts, ensuring academic integrity and trust in digital communication.

Method: The study compares classical ML methods like Logistic Regression with transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, etc.) using a dataset of 250 pairs of abstracts, with a focus on detecting AI-generated research texts.

Result: DistilBERT showed the best performance. Logistic Regression and a custom BERT model were competitive, while LSTM and BERT-N-gram models underperformed. An ensemble of top models could not outperform standalone DistilBERT.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the superiority of transformer-based models like DistilBERT for AI-text detection and suggest developing more advanced frameworks with richer datasets to keep pace with evolving AI models.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConceptViz, a visual analytics tool to enhance understanding and validation of how concepts are represented in large language models (LLMs) through Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of interpreting knowledge representations in LLMs, where sparse autoencoder features do not naturally align with human-understandable concepts, making interpretation difficult.

Method: The proposed ConceptViz system employs a three-step pipeline: Identification of interesting concepts, Interpretation of the alignments between features and concepts, and Validation by model behavior verification. This pipeline is interactive and designed for exploring concept-to-feature alignments.

Result: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ConceptViz via two case studies and a user study, showing that it makes the discovery and validation of interpretable concepts in LLMs more efficient.

Conclusion: ConceptViz simplifies the process of understanding feature representation in LLMs, helping researchers to build more accurate models of these features and further interpretability studies. The tool and its documentation have been made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

### [45] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SKILL-RAG, a method to improve retrieval-augmented generation by leveraging self-knowledge from language models to filter out irrelevant documents and enhance response accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation systems often incorporate irrelevant content into large language models, leading to hallucinations and degraded task performance.

Method: SKILL-RAG uses reinforcement learning to elicit self-knowledge from language models, enabling sentence-level filtering of retrieved documents to prioritize relevant external knowledge.

Result: Experimental assessments using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on question answering benchmarks show significant improvements in response quality and reduction in input document quantity.

Conclusion: The approach validates that self-knowledge of language models can effectively guide the selection of high-quality retrievals, thereby enhancing the integration of external and internal knowledge in RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Emo-FiLM, a framework enabling fine-grained word-level emotion control in text-to-speech systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotional text-to-speech methods lack the capability to handle dynamic emotional shifts within a sentence effectively.

Method: The method involves aligning frame-level features to word-level emotion annotations via emotion2vec and modulating text embeddings using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer.

Result: Emo-FiLM surpasses existing TTS systems in both global and fine-grained emotion modeling, as shown in experiments.

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM improves expressive speech synthesis by enabling detailed emotional control, making it a versatile and effective tool.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces USB-Rec, a training-inference framework for enhancing LLMs in conversational recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches leverage LLMs’ capabilities for summarization and analysis but neglect how training could improve their performance in conversational recommendation.

Method: The authors propose USB-Rec, integrating LLM-based Preference Optimization dataset creation for reinforcement learning training and a Self-Enhancement Strategy for inference.

Result: Experiments show that USB-Rec outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in conversational recommender systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances LLMs by combining training and inference strategies, optimizing their performance in conversational recommendation tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Conformal Importance Summarization, a framework ensuring importance-preserving summaries via conformal prediction with coverage guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of reliable inclusion of critical content in summarization systems, especially in high-stakes domains.

Method: They developed a model-agnostic framework using conformal prediction and calibrated thresholds on sentence importance scores, enabling extractive summarization with user-specified coverage.

Result: The method achieved theoretically assured information coverage rates in experiments on standard summarization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework allows for reliable, controlled summarization, making AI tools safer for high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge posed by misinformation in TikTok videos, which are difficult to assess due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy nature.

Method: The proposed method, 'ShortCheck,' is an inference-only modular pipeline that combines tools like speech transcription, OCR, object/deepfake detection, video-text summarization, and claim verification.

Abstract: Short-form video platforms like TikTok present unique challenges for
misinformation detection due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy content.
We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly
interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help
human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object

### [50] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MARS (Multi-Agent Review System) to improve reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a role-based collaboration framework inspired by peer-reviewing, achieving accuracy comparable to Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reasoning limitations in LLMs and reduce computational overhead inherent in the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) approach.

Method: Introduced MARS framework consisting of role-based collaboration: author agent generates initial solutions, reviewer agents independently provide feedback, and a meta-reviewer integrates comments for revisions.

Result: MARS achieves similar accuracy to MAD while reducing token usage and inference time by roughly 50%, showing better efficiency and competitive reasoning quality.

Conclusion: MARS improves reasoning capabilities for LLMs while providing a more computationally efficient alternative to MAD, balancing quality and performance trade-offs effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address low-resource machine translation challenges, especially for languages like Cantonese and Wu Chinese, which lack sufficient training data and resources.

Method: Creation of the SiniticMTError dataset with error spans, error types, and severity annotations, derived from existing parallel corpora, along with a detailed annotation process by native speakers.

Result: The dataset is designed for use in fine-tuning MT models with error detection, aiding various MT-related research areas—like quality estimation and low-resource language evaluation.

Conclusion: SiniticMTError provides a valuable resource for improving MT systems for underrepresented Chinese languages, fostering advancements in error-aware and low-resource translation tasks.

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM presents a zero-shot framework for multilingual medical diagnosis, achieving high performance across English, Hindi, and Bengali without language-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of automatic disease diagnosis in multilingual healthcare environments, particularly in low-resource languages with limited annotated data.

Method: The framework uses a multilingual encoder (XLM-RoBERTa) with language-aware attention, a Siamese contrastive learning module, translation consistency, and MAML-based rapid adaptation capabilities. Multi-task learning optimizes disease classification, alignment, and representation tasks.

Result: SwasthLLM achieves 97.22% test accuracy, 97.17% F1-score in supervised settings, and demonstrates strong generalization with 92.78% accuracy in Hindi and 73.33% in Bengali medical text in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively addresses the challenges of multilingual and low-resource medical diagnosis by aligning cross-lingual semantic representations and generalizing effectively across tasks and languages.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS-MoE, a depth-specialized transformer model for efficient reasoning by activating varying computation depths based on input complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers apply uniform computational depth to all inputs, which wastes resources and limits reasoning capacity for tasks requiring diverse computational depth.

Method: DS-MoE employs depth-specialized expert modules connected via a learned routing network to dynamically assemble reasoning chains for inputs of varying complexity.

Result: Experiments show DS-MoE achieves 16% computational savings, 35% faster inference, and 2.8% better accuracy on complex reasoning tasks compared to uniform-depth transformers.

Conclusion: DS-MoE provides improved efficiency, accuracy, scalability, and interpretability for neural language models by leveraging adaptive depth-specialized computation.

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a wavelet-inspired architecture that processes language across multiple resolutions, improving efficiency and accuracy compared to standard transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers misrepresent language’s hierarchical structure, leading to inefficiencies and inadequate modeling of discourse-level context.

Method: HRT employs a multi-resolution attention mechanism with exponential sequence reduction across scales, achieving O(nlogn) complexity and enabling hierarchical language processing.

Result: HRT outperformed baselines by up to +6.1% on tasks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, and Long Range Arena, while reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37%. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of its mechanisms.

Conclusion: HRT aligns computational models with language’s hierarchical nature, offering theoretical efficiency gains and practical accuracy improvements, establishing itself as a step forward in language understanding architecture.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes FS-DFM, a fast discrete flow-matching model for language generation, achieving high-quality sampling in only a few steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models have high latency for generating long sequences, and discrete diffusion models require many iterations for quality output. The paper aims to overcome both limitations.

Method: The authors introduced FS-DFM, where the model is trained for consistency across varied step budgets, paired with a reliable update rule and teacher-guided trajectories.

Result: FS-DFM achieves similar perplexity to a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline using just 8 steps, enabling up to 128x faster sampling.

Conclusion: FS-DFM is a stable, fast, and effective model for parallelized language generation with significant latency and throughput improvements.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

*Jungsoo Park,Ethan Mendes,Gabriel Stanovsky,Alan Ritter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores whether performance on benchmarks for large language models can be forecasted without running experiments, using their curated PRECOG dataset to systematically investigate text-only performance forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evaluation of large language models is bottlenecked by the need to build benchmarks, complete evaluations, and iterate upon results, prompting the need for alternative methods like forecasting outcomes pre-experiment.

Method: The authors developed and tested text-only performance forecasting techniques using PRECOG, a corpus of description-performance pairs, incorporating models equipped with retrieval modules and a zero-leakage setting with tools like GPT-5 for prediction assessments.

Result: The study found that forecasting performance is challenging yet feasible, with models achieving mean absolute errors as low as 8.7 on certain subsets. Analysis highlights stronger reasoning models utilizing diverse queries, while current open-source ones show limitations.

Conclusion: This research indicates the potential for anticipatory evaluation in large language models, enabling smarter experiment prioritization and informed difficulty estimation, despite open challenges in forecasting accuracy and reasoning diversity.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

### [57] [Building Tailored Speech Recognizers for Japanese Speaking Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20655)
*Yotaro Kubo,Richard Sproat,Chihiro Taguchi,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods to improve Japanese speech recognizers by addressing data sparsity through multitask learning and fusion techniques, achieving a notable reduction in phonemic labeling errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Japanese speech assessment tasks require accurate phonemic transcriptions, including accent markers, but face challenges due to limited annotated data for training models.

Method: Two methods were proposed: (1) multitask learning to leverage orthographic text and pitch pattern annotations as auxiliary signals, and (2) estimator fusion using a finite-state transducer framework to combine phonetic and textual transcriptions.

Result: The methods effectively improved the accuracy of phonemic recognizers, reducing mora-label error rates from 12.3% to 7.1% over core evaluation sets.

Conclusion: The proposed multitask learning and fusion strategies enhance Japanese speech recognition accuracy, outperforming generic multilingual systems while mitigating challenges from data sparsity.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

*Peng Zhou,Lai Hou Tim,Zhixiang Cheng,Kun Xie,Chaoyi Li,Wei Liu,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper integrates knowledge from large language models (LLMs) with structural features from pre-trained molecular models to improve molecular property prediction (MPP), demonstrating superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need to enhance molecular property prediction (MPP) in drug discovery, leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) while addressing their limitations.

Method: They propose a framework that combines knowledge extracted from LLMs with structural features from pre-trained molecular models. LLMs generate domain-relevant knowledge and molecular vectorization code, with three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-R1) employed for this task.

Result: The integration of knowledge from LLMs with molecular structure representations leads to superior predictive performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-derived knowledge with molecular models offers a more robust and effective solution for MPP, advancing the capabilities of current prediction approaches.

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

### [59] [RedHerring Attack: Testing the Reliability of Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20691)
*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces RedHerring, an attack to make adversarial text detection models unreliable by manipulating detector predictions while preserving classifier accuracy, dropping detection accuracy significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and challenge the reliability of adversarial text detection models, which are crucial for safeguarding NLP systems against manipulated input.

Method: Proposes the RedHerring threat model, testing its impact on 4 datasets, 3 attack detectors, and 4 classifiers, alongside a simple defense requiring no retraining.

Result: RedHerring decreases detection accuracy by 20-71 points while maintaining or improving classifier accuracy. A suggested defense significantly boosts detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The RedHerring model highlights a critical vulnerability in adversarial text detection, providing insight for future defense mechanisms.

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

### [60] [Overcoming Black-box Attack Inefficiency with Hybrid and Dynamic Select Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20699)
*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel strategies, Hybrid and Dynamic Select, to improve the efficiency of adversarial text attacks on NLP models, reducing query costs while maintaining attack effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box attack methods for robustness testing in NLP models are computationally expensive and inefficient, making them less accessible to researchers with limited resources.

Method: Two new attack selection strategies, Hybrid Select and Dynamic Select, are introduced. Hybrid Select combines BinarySelect and GreedySelect using a size threshold, while Dynamic Select uses learning to decide which algorithm is best for different lengths of text.

Result: The sentence-level Hybrid Select strategy achieves a 25.82% reduction in the number of queries per attack on average across 4 datasets and 6 models, while maintaining effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly reduce computational costs associated with adversarial attacks without compromising their effectiveness, enhancing the accessibility of NLP robustness testing.

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

### [61] [MI-Fuse: Label Fusion for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Closed-Source Large-Audio Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20706)
*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse enables a student model to surpass an API-only large audio-language model (LALM) in target-domain speech emotion recognition (SER) under domain mismatch using unlabeled data and mutual-information-based uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of speech emotion recognition (SER) systems is hindered by domain mismatch and lack of access to labeled source data, as well as limitations of powerful LALMs accessible only via APIs.

Method: MI-Fuse combines predictions from an API-based LALM and a source-domain SER classifier using mutual-information-based weighting to fuse stochastic predictions. It stabilizes model training with an exponential moving average teacher.

Result: The proposed MI-Fuse approach consistently outperforms the LALM and baseline models across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers, achieving a 3.9% improvement over the strongest baseline.

Conclusion: MI-Fuse enhances the adaptability of speech emotion recognition systems in real-world conditions, allowing for superior performance in the target domain without the need for shared source data.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

### [62] [Probability Distribution Collapse: A Critical Bottleneck to Compact Unsupervised Neural Grammar Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20734)
*Jinwook Park,Kangil Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving unsupervised neural grammar induction by addressing the issue of 'probability distribution collapse'. The proposed 'collapse-relaxing neural parameterization' improves parsing performance and allows for more compact grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for unsupervised neural grammar induction produce overly large grammars that perform suboptimally. This is tied to a phenomenon called 'probability distribution collapse', which this paper seeks to understand and mitigate.

Method: The authors identify key factors leading to 'probability distribution collapse' in neural parameterization and introduce a method called 'collapse-relaxing neural parameterization' to address it.

Result: The proposed approach improves parsing performance and enables the use of smaller, more efficient grammars, as confirmed through empirical analysis spanning multiple languages.

Conclusion: The study provides a targeted method to overcome a core limitation in neural grammar induction, advancing its practical effectiveness and interpretability by mitigating 'probability distribution collapse'.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

*Youwon Jang,Woo Suk Choi,Minjoon Jung,Minsu Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a method to improve QA models' performance by leveraging sub-questions and answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning and answer reliability in QA tasks across multiple domains (text, image, and video) by integrating sub-question analysis.

Method: C2R refines sub-questions and their answers, uses confidence scores to select better answers, and integrates seamlessly with existing QA models to improve performance.

Result: C2R shows consistent performance improvements across QA models and benchmarks, and provides insights into sub-question quantity and quality impacts.

Conclusion: C2R is an effective, training-free framework that enhances QA model reliability and reasoning through confidence score-guided sub-QA analysis.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits and explores strategies to counter the trade-off between domain-specific optimization and general capability degradation in large language models during supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the belief that supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific tasks degrades the general capabilities of LLMs, aiming to explore whether this trade-off can be mitigated or optimized.

Method: It first highlights the use of a smaller learning rate for mitigation, introduces a Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting (TALR) method supported by theoretical analysis, and evaluates various other strategies like L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, and FLOW.

Result: Experimental results showed that TALR consistently performed better than alternative methods, achieving a superior balance between domain-specific task performance and general capabilities retention.

Conclusion: The study recommends using small learning rates for a better trade-off and incorporating TALR for stronger balance when adapting LLMs to new domains.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

### [65] [Towards Atoms of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20784)
*Chenhui Hu,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Atoms Theory as a novel approach to defining units of representation in large language models (LLMs), addressing issues found with neurons and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of a universally accepted and stable definition for fundamental units of internal representation in LLMs, hindering deeper mechanistic understanding.

Method: The authors propose the Atoms Theory, define an atomic inner product (AIP) to correct representation shifting, and prove conditions for stable sparse representations using the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). They further validate the theory using threshold-activated sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on various large-scale models.

Result: Experiments showed 99.9% sparse reconstruction accuracy across layers using atoms, with more than 99.8% satisfying uniqueness conditions, outperforming neurons and features significantly.

Conclusion: The Atoms Theory offers a robust framework for understanding and capturing the intrinsic representations in LLMs, addressing issues of instability and polysemy, and advancing mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

### [66] [Few-Shot and Training-Free Review Generation via Conversational Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20805)
*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Conversational Prompting," a method to improve personalized review generation using large language models (LLMs) under few-shot and training-free conditions, outperforming traditional prompts in replicating user styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing review generation methods rely on extensive user review histories or additional model training, which are infeasible in real-world cases with limited data. The researchers aim to address this gap with prompt engineering for LLMs.

Method: The paper proposes a conversational method to enhance LLMs' output. Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP) uses only the target user's reviews, while Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP) incorporates reviews from others or generated incorrect replies to help models better mimic users' styles.

Result: Experiments across 8 product domains and 5 LLMs revealed that conversational prompting methods (SCP and CCP) significantly outperformed conventional prompts, even when users had only two prior reviews.

Conclusion: Conversational Prompting, particularly SCP and CCP, offers an effective and training-free approach to personalized review generation under low-resource conditions, with CCP excelling when high-quality negative examples are available.

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

*Songze Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Zhengke Gui,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with hallucinations in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) due to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured queries. To address this, the paper introduces the "Enrich-on-Graph" (EoG) framework, leveraging LLMs to improve reasoning capabilities and enhance KGQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to address the challenges of hallucinations and factual errors encountered by Large Language Models (LLMs) during knowledge graph question answering. They attribute these issues to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs and unstructured queries.

Method: The paper proposes a framework called "Enrich-on-Graph" (EoG). EoG enriches knowledge graphs using LLMs' prior knowledge, enabling efficient evidence extraction and bridging the semantic gap between graphs and queries. Additionally, three graph-quality evaluation metrics are developed to analyze alignment in KGQA.

Result: Experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets show that EoG effectively generates high-quality knowledge graphs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The "Enrich-on-Graph" framework is both computationally efficient and scalable. It enhances reasoning capabilities in KGQA by leveraging LLMs for knowledge graph enrichment, resulting in improved precision, robustness, and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PoCO, an approach combining the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) for grammatical error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sLMs have high precision but low recall, while LLMs have high recall but low precision. The objective is to integrate their benefits and balance recall and precision for more effective grammatical error correction.

Method: PoCO triggers overcorrections using LLMs to maximize recall and then employs fine-tuned sLMs for post-correction to refine errors.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PoCO improves recall while maintaining competitive precision, leading to better overall performance in grammatical error correction.

Conclusion: The PoCO framework successfully harmonizes LLM generative abilities with sLM reliability, offering an improved balance of precision and recall in grammatical error correction.

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method called cheat-sheet ICL to reduce computational costs of large language models while maintaining performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of many-shot in-context learning (ICL) in large language models due to long input tokens.

Method: Cheat-sheet ICL distills many-shot examples into a concise textual summary, which is used as the context during inference.

Result: Cheat-sheet ICL performs comparably or better than many-shot ICL and retrieval-based ICL in challenging reasoning tasks, using fewer tokens and without the need for test-time retrieval.

Conclusion: Cheat-sheet ICL is a practical and efficient technique for utilizing large language models in downstream tasks, reducing computational burden without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

*Shuo Huang,Xingliang Yuan,Gholamreza Haffari,Lizhen Qu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot, tree-search-based algorithm for anonymizing text, achieving better balance between privacy preservation and text utility compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address privacy concerns in large language models (LLMs) used in cloud-based services, where user inputs can expose sensitive information. Current techniques often fail to balance privacy and text utility.

Method: The method is a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence rewriting algorithm. It obfuscates or removes private information using a structured search guided by a reward model, ensuring coherence, relevance, and naturalness.

Result: The proposed method showed significant improvement over baseline techniques on privacy-sensitive datasets, achieving a better balance between privacy preservation and utility.

Conclusion: The work presents an effective solution to anonymize text inputs for large language models, offering enhanced privacy without sacrificing naturalness and coherence.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues in citations for RAG question-answering systems and proposes a method to generate concise sub-sentence citations, improving citation relevance and user understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current citation methods for LLMs in RAG systems are either too broad or omit essential information necessary for verifying outputs.

Method: The researchers developed annotation guidelines, constructed a dataset, leveraged LLMs for generating fine-tuning data, and utilized a credit model to filter low-quality examples.

Result: Experiments using the dataset demonstrated that the new framework produces higher-quality and more readable citations.

Conclusion: Generating sub-sentence citations enhances citation relevance, reduces verification effort, and provides better user support in confirming the correctness of the output.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

### [72] [WeFT: Weighted Entropy-driven Fine-Tuning for dLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20863)
*Guowei Xu,Wenxin Xu,Jiawang Zhao,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes WeFT, a weighted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method for diffusion language models, significantly enhancing their performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models in language modeling offer fast generation but struggle with fine-tuning due to inconsistent generation and lack of precise probability estimates, making token control essential.

Method: The authors introduce WeFT, a weighted SFT approach that assigns different token weights based on their entropy derived from diffusion theory.

Result: WeFT achieves substantial performance improvements—39%, 64%, and 83%—over standard SFT on benchmarks like Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and MATH-500.

Conclusion: WeFT effectively addresses inconsistencies in diffusion language models during reasoning, demonstrating its superiority over standard SFT methods. Code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

### [73] [Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20866)
*Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Natpatchara Pongjirapat,Krittaphas Chaisutyakorn,Piyalitt Ittichaiwong,Tossaporn Saengja,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how medical reasoning models (MRMs) can generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended medical questions, rather than just single answers. It explores costs and effectiveness of two methods: prompting and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical reasoning often requires multiple valid answers. Current medical models are typically trained to provide one answer, which may limit their applicability in open-ended medical cases.

Method: The authors used two approaches for enabling MRMs to generate ranked answer lists: prompting, a cost-effective steering method, and fine-tuning via supervised (SFT) and reinforcement (RFT) techniques. They also developed new reward functions for RFT experiments.

Result: RFT-trained models showed robustness across multiple answer formats, outperforming SFT in generalization. A modified case study on MedQA demonstrated MRMs could identify multiple valid answers even when benchmark ground truths differed.

Conclusion: The study is the first systematic investigation into generating ranked answers for medical open-ended questions. It suggests alternative answer formats could better support medical decision-making processes that involve multiple valid answers.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SummQ introduces a novel multi-agent framework for long document summarization by integrating summarization and quizzing agents, resulting in improved summary quality and evaluation on established benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with information loss, factual inaccuracies, and coherence issues in summarizing long documents, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: SummQ uses an adversarial multi-agent system with specialized agents for summarization and quizzing, operating collaboratively and iteratively to refine summaries through dynamic feedback mechanisms.

Result: SummQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ROUGE, BERTScore, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human evaluations across three benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of adversarial and collaborative agent dynamics, setting a new standard for long document summarization methods by integrating quizzing as a quality-check mechanism.

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

### [75] [MemLens: Uncovering Memorization in LLMs with Activation Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20909)
*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'MemLens,' a method to detect memorization in large language models by analyzing probability trajectories of numeric tokens during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods for memorization in LLMs rely on surface-level patterns and perform poorly on implicitly contaminated data, necessitating a more robust detection approach.

Method: MemLens examines how numeric tokens' probability trajectories evolve during generation, revealing distinctive reasoning patterns in contaminated versus clean data. These patterns were further validated through data injected via LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: The study discovered that contaminated samples show distinct shortcut behaviors with strong confidence in early layers, while clean samples demonstrate gradual evidence accumulation. This separation confirms the genuine detection of memorization signals by MemLens.

Conclusion: MemLens provides a robust tool for detecting memorization in LLMs, offering evidence that its signals are grounded in reasoning patterns rather than artifacts or spurious correlations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [76] [Tool Calling for Arabic LLMs: Data Strategies and Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20957)
*Asim Ersoy,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar,Kareem Darwish*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing tool-calling capabilities in Arabic LLMs through analysis of data sourcing, instruction tuning, and fine-tuning specific tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool calling research is predominantly English-focused, leaving a gap in understanding how to enable this functionality in other languages like Arabic.

Method: The authors translated tool-calling datasets into Arabic and conducted experiments using Arabic LLMs to assess impacts of in-language data, general instruction tuning, and fine-tuning on high-value tools.

Result: The study provides new insights on strategies for enhancing tool-calling efficiency in Arabic LLMs by leveraging both data transfer and specialized techniques.

Conclusion: Optimal tool-calling strategies for Arabic LLMs combine in-language adaptation, instruction tuning, and fine-tuned training for specific tools.

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

*Valeria Ramirez-Garcia,David de-Fitero-Dominguez,Antonio Garcia-Cabot,Eva Garcia-Lopez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) as evaluators for academic Text-Input Problems, finding that the Reference Aided Evaluation method aligns best with human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the application of LLMs in automatic evaluation systems for academic purposes, particularly the scoring of student answers, using rubrics.

Method: The study proposes and tests five evaluation systems, including Reference Aided Evaluation, Additive Evaluation, Adaptive Evaluation, JudgeLM Evaluation, and No Reference Evaluation, across a dataset with models like JudgeLM and Llama-3.1-8B.

Result: Reference Aided Evaluation performed best, with the lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and root mean square deviation (1.214), closely matching human evaluations.

Conclusion: AI-driven evaluation systems, particularly those using Reference Aided Evaluation, could effectively complement traditional academic evaluation methods, but other approaches showed limitations in accuracy and insights.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

*Arun S. Maiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) assist federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) in efficiently processing heavy text workloads using secure AI frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual analysis of text-heavy documents (e.g., policy documents and scientific papers) faced by FFRDCs is slow and resource-intensive, necessitating more efficient solutions.

Method: The paper demonstrates the use of large language models (LLMs) to perform summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making tasks. It applies an open-source framework, OnPrem.LLM, to ensure secure and auditable AI application in sensitive government contexts.

Result: The application of LLMs through OnPrem.LLM effectively accelerates tasks on defense policy documents and scientific datasets (e.g, NDAA and NSF Awards). This enhances oversight, strategic analysis, and ensures data sovereignty and auditability.

Conclusion: LLMs, integrated with secure open-source frameworks, can robustly address the challenges of analyzing complex and sensitive datasets in government-related contexts, achieving better efficiency and compliance.

Abstract: Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy
workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are
slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

### [79] [Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21042)
*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of the causal mask in generating position-dependent patterns in attention scores in Transformer decoders, suggesting its positional information is complementary to explicit encodings like RoPE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the impact of the causal mask on attention score patterns and its role as a source of positional information, especially in relation to explicit encodings like RoPE.

Method: Theoretical analysis to show the causal mask's ability to induce position-dependent attention patterns, supported by empirical evaluation on trained models to confirm these observations.

Result: The causal mask naturally creates patterns in attention favoring nearby positions, distorting RoPE's relative patterns. This effect is consistently found in large language models, demonstrating the causal mask's influence in positional encoding.

Conclusion: The causal mask inherently provides positional information and its interaction with explicit encodings like RoPE needs to be considered for effective Transformer model design.

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in their ability to follow multiple instructions simultaneously, introducing two benchmarks: ManyIFEval for text generation and StyleMBPP for code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess how well LLMs perform when tasked with multiple simultaneous instructions, a critical ability for real-world applications.

Method: The researchers used two specialized benchmarks to evaluate LLM performance and developed regression models to predict performance on unseen instruction combinations and varying instruction counts.

Result: The study found that LLM performance degrades as the number of instructions increases. A logistic regression model accurately predicts performance with around 10% error.

Conclusion: Performance prediction for unseen instruction scenarios can be achieved effectively with modest sample sizes, improving evaluation efficiency for LLMs under diverse instruction conditions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

TL;DR: This paper presents SoM-1K, a multimodal benchmark for evaluating foundation models on strength of materials problems and introduces a novel text-based method (DoI) to mitigate visual misinterpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored performance of foundation models on complex, multimodal engineering problems, specifically within the domain of strength of materials (SoM).

Method: The authors created SoM-1K, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1,065 annotated multimodal problems and introduced the Descriptions of Images (DoI) strategy, providing textual descriptions of diagrams to aid model performance.

Result: Foundation models performed poorly on SoM-1K, with the highest accuracy being only 56.6%. LLMs with DoI outperformed VLMs using visual diagrams, demonstrating the effectiveness of textual descriptions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the limitations of current foundation models in multimodal reasoning for engineering problems and the importance of robust text-based capabilities to improve performance.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cultural positioning biases in LLMs, introducing CultureLens benchmarks and proposing inference-time mitigation methods to address fairness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address fairness challenges in LLM-generated text, highlighting biases toward mainstream US cultural perspectives and marginalizing less dominant cultures.

Method: The authors developed the CultureLens benchmark with diverse prompts and metrics and tested 2 mitigation strategies: Fairness Intervention Pillars (FIP) and Mitigation via Fairness Agents (MFA).

Result: Empirical analysis reveals stark cultural bias patterns in 5 LLMs and demonstrates the effectiveness of MFA methods in reducing biases.

Conclusion: The structured agent-based approach shows promise in improving fairness in generative applications of LLMs, addressing cultural biases effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PerHalluEval, the first dynamic hallucination evaluation benchmark for Persian, assessing LLMs for hallucinations in QA and summarization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of hallucination in LLMs, particularly focusing on the low-resource Persian language.

Method: A three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human validation, generating and evaluating plausible answers and summaries for QA and summarization tasks. It combined log probabilities of tokens and annotations from human experts specific to Persian contexts.

Result: Evaluation of 12 LLMs showed general struggles in detecting hallucinations in Persian, while external knowledge partially reduced hallucination. No major difference between Persian-trained LLMs and others.

Conclusion: LLMs face challenges with hallucination in Persian, and while some mitigation is possible, dedicated training doesn't show large performance differences.

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

*Hyunseo Kim,Sangam Lee,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BESPOKE is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating personalization in search-augmented LLMs using real user data and detailed evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current search-augmented LLMs in understanding diverse user intents and delivering personalized responses.

Method: The authors created BESPOKE by gathering authentic user chat/search histories and annotating them with fine-grained preference scores and feedback.

Result: Using BESPOKE, the study reveals essential requirements for effective personalization and provides a tool to assess search-augmented LLMs.

Conclusion: BESPOKE enables systematic evaluation and improvement of personalization capabilities in search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [85] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ is a spoken extension of BBQ that evaluates social bias in spoken language models (SLMs), addressing both content and acoustic aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to measure how social biases manifest in SLMs due to both textual (content) and spoken (acoustic) elements, which are not covered in traditional text-only benchmarks.

Method: VoiceBBQ transforms the BBQ dataset into spoken formats with controlled voice conditions, allowing for detailed analysis of per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores.

Result: Using VoiceBBQ, the authors evaluate two SLMs (LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio) and find that LLaMA-Omni reduces acoustic bias while amplifying gender/accent bias, whereas Qwen2-Audio minimizes these biases while maintaining content fidelity.

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ serves as an effective tool for evaluating and diagnosing both content and acoustic bias in spoken language models, facilitating fairer assessments of these systems.

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores gender differentiation biases in Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs), revealing paradoxical male-oriented responses and proposing a dataset for systematic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and address gender biases and differentiation in responses from Speech-aware Language Models during human-AI voice interactions.

Method: The authors propose a novel dataset with 9,208 gender-categorized speech samples and evaluate various SpeechLMs, including LLaMA-Omni models, focusing on their response patterns and the role of Whisper speech encoders.

Result: The study identified paradoxical gender-biased patterns: male-oriented responses for Gender-Stereotypical questions and gender-indifferent responses for Gender-Dependent contexts, stemming largely from acoustic token generation in Whisper encoders.

Conclusion: Current SpeechLMs fail to appropriately balance fairness and contextual gender use, necessitating advanced techniques for proper gender-sensitive handling in speech technology.

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

### [88] [Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151)
*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework (ROC) that redefines multimodal relation extraction as a retrieval task using natural language descriptions and contrastive learning, outperforming existing methods and improving robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal relation extraction (RE) methods focus on classification-based paradigms, which are limited by their inability to incorporate structural constraints (e.g., entity types, positional cues) and lack semantic expressiveness for fine-grained understanding.

Method: The proposed ROC framework reformulates RE as a retrieval task, integrates structural information (entity type, position) through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language descriptions, and employs semantic similarity-based contrastive learning to align entity-relation pairs.

Result: ROC achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets MNRE and MORE, surpassing existing methods in robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: The ROC framework addresses key limitations of classification-based RE approaches by leveraging retrieval paradigms and enhancing semantic representation, offering a superior alternative for multimodal relation extraction tasks.

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

### [89] [Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntactic-Domain Spurious Correlations in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21155)
*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how syntactic templates can correlate with specific domains in task-instruction pairs, sometimes overriding semantic understanding, and proposes frameworks to detect and mitigate such biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how spurious correlations between syntax and domain in task instructions can affect the performance and safety of large language models (LLMs).

Method: The study analyzes syntactic templates, domains, and semantics in task-instruction pairs, uses synthetic datasets to explore correlations, introduces an evaluation framework for detection, and conducts case studies to analyze implications for model safety.

Result: Models like OLMo-2 (1B-13B) exhibit performance degradation due to spurious syntactic-domain correlations. The phenomenon was also detected in subsets of the FlanV2 dataset for open (OLMo-2-7B; Llama-4-Maverick) and closed (GPT-4o) models.

Conclusion: Spurious syntactic-domain correlations can lead to biased outputs, overriding prompt semantics. This highlights the need for explicit testing for such biases and ensuring syntactic diversity in training datasets to mitigate them.

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys computational humour's generative tasks (creation and explanation) and highlights the challenges large language models face in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and creating humour are key challenges in NLP due to the abstract, creative, and context-dependent nature of humour. Its study provides insight into the reasoning abilities of large language models.

Method: The authors review existing literature and research in computational humour focusing on the generative aspects (creation and explanation). They also assess the current limitations of state-of-the-art models.

Result: They find a lack of extensive research in humour generation and explanation, with models struggling to match human-level humour, especially beyond simple puns.

Conclusion: Further research is needed in computational humour to advance NLP, considering humour's subjective and ethical complexities.

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

### [91] [GEP: A GCG-Based method for extracting personally identifiable information from chatbots built on small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21192)
*Jieli Zhu,Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study analyzes potential personally identifiable information (PII) leakage in small language models (SLMs), specifically using a chatbot (ChatBioGPT) finetuned from BioGPT. A new method, GEP, is introduced, which significantly outperforms previous PII extraction approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of PII leakage in small language models (SLMs) and highlight their vulnerability during downstream tasks like medical chatbot operations.

Method: The study fine-tunes a new chatbot, ChatBioGPT, and introduces Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based (GCG) method, GEP, for detecting PII leakage more effectively than traditional template-based methods. GEP is also tested in free-style insertion scenarios for greater robustness.

Result: The ChatBioGPT exhibits comparable performance in BERTscore to ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. The GEP method achieves up to 60 times more PII leakage detection compared to template-based methods and retains effectiveness even in complex scenarios with a leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Conclusion: Small language models can still leak sensitive PII despite their appeal for efficiency. The study demonstrates that existing methods are insufficient for PII detection, and the GEP method provides a significant step forward in addressing this challenge.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

*Xiangru Tang,Wanghan Xu,Yujie Wang,Zijie Guo,Daniel Shao,Jiapeng Chen,Cixuan Zhang,Ziyi Wang,Lixin Zhang,Guancheng Wan,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Zhenfei Yin,Philip Torr,Hanrui Wang,Di Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for improving the scientific reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating implicit retrieval and structured collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current limitations of LLMs include inefficiencies from explicit retrieval processes and diluted solutions in multi-agent frameworks. The motivation is to address these by enhancing reasoning processes and minimizing disruptions.

Method: The framework uses a Monitor-based retrieval module for seamless knowledge integration and introduces two approaches: Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) for improved collaboration and Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) for quality-based refinement.

Result: On the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark, it achieves a record 48.3% accuracy, beating previous baselines by up to 18.1 percentage points while reducing token usage and agent steps significantly. Results across other datasets affirm robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses LLM inefficiencies by combining implicit knowledge integration with structured refinement, leading to substantial improvements in accuracy, token usage, and reasoning efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

### [93] [CLaw: Benchmarking Chinese Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models - A Fine-grained Corpus and Reasoning Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21208)
*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLaw, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Chinese legal knowledge, and highlights the shortcomings of current LLMs in legal reasoning and citation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unreliable performance of general LLMs in legal applications due to their lack of specialized focus and accurate retrieval of legal knowledge.

Method: The study developed CLaw, consisting of a fine-grained corpus of Chinese statutes (64,849 entries) and 254 case-based reasoning instances, to rigorously evaluate LLMs’ ability to reproduce legal provisions and apply legal reasoning.

Result: Results show that most contemporary LLMs struggle with accurately reproducing legal provisions, thereby demonstrating weaknesses in legal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in LLMs requires a combination of accurate legal knowledge retrieval methods (like SFT or RAG) and robust reasoning abilities, offering insights for improving domain-specific LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

*Yaxiong Wu,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SGMem (Sentence Graph Memory), a memory management framework for long-term conversational agents, leveraging sentence-level graphs to organize and retrieve relevant dialogue information across multiple granularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for conversational memory management struggle to handle long dialogue histories effectively, especially when it comes to organizing and retrieving relevant information at different levels of context.

Method: The researchers propose SGMem, which structures dialogue into sentence-level graphs and integrates raw dialogue with generated memory (summaries, facts, insights) to provide LLMs with coherent and relevant contexts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SGMem improves the accuracy of long-term conversational models and surpasses strong baseline methods in long-term conversational question answering tasks.

Conclusion: SGMem proves to be a superior solution for managing dialogue memory in long-term conversational agents, addressing the limitations of existing approaches and ensuring more effective response generation.

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

*Yaxiong Wu,Jianyuan Bo,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph retrieval-augmented generation framework to address limitations of existing methods in granularity. It improves multi-hop retrieval and achieves better question answering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the granularity dilemma in graph-based RAG methods, which struggle to balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained graphs when enriching LLMs.

Method: A query-centric graph framework, using Doc2Query and Doc2Query-- for constructing graphs with controllable granularity and a tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism for selecting relevant chunks.

Result: The QCG-RAG approach consistently outperforms previous chunk-based and graph-based methods on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG benchmarks in question answering accuracy.

Conclusion: QCG-RAG sets a new standard for query-granular indexing and multi-hop reasoning, enabling enhanced retrieval and interpretability for graph-based RAG systems.

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

*Evgeny Kaskov,Elizaveta Petrova,Petr Surovtsev,Anna Kostikova,Ilya Mistiurin,Alexander Kapitanov,Alexander Nagaev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of homonym duplication in generative diffusion models, exacerbated by Anglocentric bias, and proposes an evaluation and mitigation approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying and addressing the issue of homonym duplication in diffusion models caused by ambiguous word meanings, especially when translation into English creates additional challenges.

Method: The authors introduce a method to measure duplication rates by evaluating diffusion models via automatic evaluation leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human evaluation. They propose prompt expansion as a strategy to mitigate the issue.

Result: The introduced evaluation methods successfully assess homonym duplication in models, and the proposed prompt expansion technique reduces duplication issues, including those linked to Anglocentric biases.

Conclusion: Prompt expansion is an effective method for reducing homonym duplication and Anglocentric biases in diffusion models, and the proposed evaluation pipeline is made publicly available.

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

*Shomik Jain,Jack Lanchantin,Maximilian Nickel,Karen Ullrich,Ashia Wilson,Jamelle Watson-Daniels*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines output homogenization in large language models and introduces task-dependent methods to categorize, evaluate, and mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models can produce overly similar responses, which may not always be desirable. Understanding and addressing this behavior in a task-specific way is crucial for improving their utility.

Method: The authors establish an eight-category task taxonomy, propose a task-anchored metric for evaluating functional diversity, and introduce a sampling technique to control homogenization based on task requirements.

Result: The proposed methodology increases functional diversity where needed while maintaining response quality, challenging the notion of a diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: Task sensitivity is critical in evaluating and mitigating output homogenization in language models, and the presented techniques offer effective solutions for task-specific diversity control.

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

*Irina Tolstykh,Aleksandra Tsybina,Sergey Yakubson,Maksim Kuprashevich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents LLMTrace, a bilingual dataset for detecting AI-generated text, designed for precise and nuanced AI detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is the lack of robust datasets for training AI text detection systems, particularly those that handle mixed human-AI authorship and provide character-level annotations for precise localization.

Method: The researchers created a large bilingual (English and Russian) dataset using modern proprietary and open-source LLMs, incorporating character-level annotations for AI-generated text. The dataset supports binary classification (human vs. AI) and a new task of interval detection for AI-generated segments.

Result: The result is the introduction of LLMTrace, a pioneering dataset that fills critical gaps in detecting AI-generated text with precision and supporting mixed authorship scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMTrace is a vital resource for advancing AI detection models, enabling more nuanced and practical applications in the field.

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the influence of input perturbations on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) output, providing theoretical bounds on their effects and validating findings with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the lack of theoretical understanding about how input perturbations impact CoT outputs, which is crucial for improving prompt optimization methods.

Method: The researchers derive an upper bound for input perturbations to study their influence on CoT outputs. They then apply this analysis to the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, deriving specific correlations and validating their findings through experiments on datasets and models.

Result: The analysis reveals that the perturbation upper bound correlates positively with CoT reasoning steps and that perturbation effects cannot be fully eliminated. For the LSA model, the upper bound negatively correlates with input embedding and hidden state vector norms.

Conclusion: The findings provide both theoretical insights and experimental validation, enhancing the understanding of input perturbations in CoT reasoning and contributing to the optimization of prompt strategies.

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisCoCLIP, a vision-language model designed to improve compositional reasoning in tasks that require understanding syntactic structures by combining CLIP with a novel tensor network text encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of current vision-language models, which struggle with tasks involving word order and syntactic relationships due to neglect of compositional linguistic structures.

Method: The DisCoCLIP model combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a tensor network-based text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic structures derived from sentences using Combinatory Categorial Grammar parsing. Tensor decompositions are employed to maintain efficiency.

Result: DisCoCLIP outperforms CLIP in several benchmarks, including improving CLIP's verb accuracy in SVO-Probes from 77.6% to 82.4%, increasing ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieving an accuracy of 93.7% on the new SVO-Swap benchmark.

Conclusion: Embedding explicit linguistic structures through tensor networks significantly enhances the interpretability, parameter efficiency, and compositional reasoning abilities of vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Updesh, a synthetic instruction-following dataset for 13 Indian languages generated using a culturally contextualized bottom-up strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of developing multilingual and culturally grounded AI systems, especially in low-resource language settings.

Method: A bottom-up strategy employing large open-source LLMs to generate synthetic datasets grounded in Indian language-specific Wikipedia content.

Result: Updesh dataset consists of 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages, and models trained on it exhibit significant improvements in generative tasks and competitiveness in natural language understanding tasks, especially for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Effective multilingual AI requires context-aware, culturally grounded methods for synthetic data generation and curation to improve performance across diverse languages and tasks.

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

*Daniel Vennemeyer,Phan Anh Duong,Tiffany Zhan,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates sycophantic behaviors in large language models (LLMs) and finds them arising from distinct, independently steerable mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether sycophantic behaviors in LLMs stem from a single or multiple distinct mechanisms.

Method: Analyzed sycophancy by decomposing it into distinct behaviors, utilizing techniques like difference-in-means directions, activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple LLMs and datasets.

Result: Found that sycophantic agreement, sycophantic praise, and genuine agreement are encoded along distinct, linear directions that can be independently manipulated in LLMs.

Conclusion: Sycophantic behaviors in LLMs are distinct phenomena, encoded in independently steerable vector subspaces, and their representation is stable across model scales and families.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), combining human-driven preferences and rule-based verification to improve reward models in LLM learning, outperforming existing methods in key benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in RLHF (interpretability and reward hacking) and RLVR (limited scope), developing a new paradigm to capture nuanced response quality metrics.

Method: Proposed RLBFF, which uses binary principles extracted from human feedback and trains Reward Models as an entailment task focusing on specific principles at inference time.

Result: RLBFF-trained Reward Models outperformed Bradley-Terry methodology on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%), with customization capabilities and lower inference cost.

Conclusion: RLBFF demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods in reward modeling for LLMs, providing flexibility, performance increase, and open-source scalability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Method: The model is pre-trained on a vast 206B-token corpus, fine-tuned with instruction-following datasets, cold-start bootstrapping for reasoning chains, and task-specific reinforcement learning.

Result: The model excels in translation, extraction, prediction, classification, and generation tasks, outperforming specialist systems in flexibility, generalization, and fidelity.

Conclusion: Cross-discipline training strengthens the capabilities of the model, making it reliable and adaptable for a wide range of scientific tasks; the work is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural
language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained
on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and
sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed
cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and
reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills
deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering
up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and
scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction,
(iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence
generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens
instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances

### [105] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient method to detect vision-language model (VLM) hallucinations using traditional machine learning on next-token probabilities (NTPs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM hallucinations, where generated text misaligns with visual content, undermine model reliability. Detecting them often requires complex methods which are computationally expensive.

Method: The paper introduces an on-the-fly hallucination detection technique that uses NTPs to measure model uncertainty. It employs lightweight machine learning models trained on these signals and tests them on a labeled dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements.

Result: The NTP-based method proves effective, achieving performance comparable to sophisticated VLMs. Combining linguistic NTPs and integrating predictions from VLMs further boosts performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lightweight approaches leveraging NTPs can reliably detect VLM hallucinations, potentially enhancing the efficiency and reliability of these models.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fast-SEnSeI, a sensor-independent cloud segmentation module optimized for on-board processing across varied multispectral sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud segmentation is an essential preprocessing task in Earth observation that often lacks sensor flexibility and on-board processing adaptability.

Method: The paper proposes a lightweight encoder (Fast-SEnSeI) with spectral descriptors, adaptable input handling, and a hybrid CPU-FPGA pipeline leveraging Apache TVM for efficiency.

Result: Fast-SEnSeI achieved accurate cloud segmentation across Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets under various input configurations.

Conclusion: Fast-SEnSeI demonstrates its capability as a flexible and efficient cloud segmentation solution for diverse Earth observation scenarios, compatible with space-qualified hardware.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Riemannian geometry-based framework using synthetic data generation for improving writer-independent offline handwritten signature verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of writer-independent handwritten signature verification remains challenging due to the need for models to generalize across unseen individuals, and existing methods heavily rely on real-world datasets for training.

Method: The paper introduces a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. Genuine SPD samples are used to create a Riemannian Gaussian Mixture, which generates synthetic SPD data for training via metric learning.

Result: Experiments on two signature datasets (Western and Asian writing styles) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves low error rates in both intra- and cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach shows that generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces is an effective way to enhance writer-independent signature verification systems.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified and high-performance system capable of handling diverse image generation tasks for both creative and professional applications, overcoming inefficiencies in current methods.

Method: The approach involves a diffusion transformer combined with a powerful VAE for efficient image token reduction, extensive pretraining on diverse text-image data, and multimodal post-training integrating a fine-tuned VLM. For inference, techniques like adversarial distillation, distribution matching, quantization, and speculative decoding are used.

Result: Seedream 4.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and complex multimodal tasks. It supports fast generation of high-resolution images and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 enhances traditional T2I systems by introducing multidimensional interactive capabilities, making it a cutting-edge tool for creative and professional applications in generative AI.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study presents a Contrastive Learning framework to improve breast cancer detection using smaller labeled datasets. Training ResNet-50 with semi-supervised learning and augmentations achieved 96.7% accuracy on key benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early-stage breast cancer detection to lower death rates, considering the limitations of deep learning methods caused by small labeled datasets.

Method: Developed a semi-supervised Contrastive Learning framework using ResNet-50, leveraging similarity indices and augmentations on large unlabeled mammogram data.

Result: Achieved 96.7% detection accuracy on INbreast and MIAS benchmark datasets, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers an efficient and high-performance approach for breast cancer detection, even with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

TL;DR: Foundation Models (FMs) excel in general text and image tasks but fail in real-world industrial quality inspection, despite performing well on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore whether Foundation Models (FMs), which eliminate the need for extensive manual labeling, can replace traditional supervised AI models for quality inspection in industrial manufacturing.

Method: The authors tested multiple recent Foundation Models on both custom real-world industrial image data and public benchmark datasets to evaluate their suitability for quality inspection tasks.

Result: Foundation Models, though performing well on public benchmark datasets, failed when applied to real-world industrial data for quality inspection.

Conclusion: While Foundation Models offer zero-shot capabilities and potential for efficiency in industrial applications, they currently fall short in real-world quality inspection scenarios when compared to their benchmark performances.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal Neural Space (NS) framework to improve efficiency in imaging and vision tasks by enabling shared feature space across modular tasks through an encoder-decoder structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models in imaging and vision are inefficient for modular tasks that require distinct latent domains. The paper aims to address this inefficiency by creating a shared feature space.

Method: An encoder-decoder framework is proposed where the encoder learns transformation-aware generalizable representations. The backbone is lightweight and CNN-based for improved hardware compatibility.

Result: The framework successfully supports multiple vision and imaging tasks such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation efficiently.

Conclusion: The universal Neural Space reduces redundancy, enhances domain generalization, and establishes a foundation for efficient multi-task vision pipelines.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on improving edge camera systems by selecting valuable images for training smaller models, achieving high quality with minimal data transmissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training smaller models for edge devices in dynamic environments while minimizing data transmission costs and maintaining high model quality.

Method: The approach involves using a high-confidence, stream-based selection strategy combined with a diversity-based method to identify the most useful images for training.

Result: The combination of these strategies results in high-quality models while keeping dataset queries and transmission costs minimal.

Conclusion: Using intelligent image selection strategies can optimize the training process for edge devices, achieving a balance between model quality and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InstructVTON, an interactive virtual try-on system that uses natural language inputs for complex styling control without requiring manually drawn masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on systems rely on manually created binary masks, which can be inflexible, model-dependent, or impossible for certain styling scenarios.

Method: InstructVTON uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models to automate mask generation based on user-provided images and free-text instructions.

Result: InstructVTON seamlessly integrates with existing virtual try-on models, enabling advanced styling control and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: InstructVTON simplifies virtual try-on by eliminating the need for precise masking and supports multi-step style customizations using natural language instructions.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Method: DeepAFRNet uses a VGG16 backbone for feature extraction and cosine similarity for fingerprint embedding comparison. It evaluates performance on the SOCOFing Real-Altered dataset with strict and relaxed thresholds.

Result: Achieved 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% accuracies for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels, respectively. The study also highlights the critical impact of threshold sensitivity on performance.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet demonstrates robustness in recognizing real altered prints and is better suited for real-world deployments compared to prior models relying on synthetic or limited data assumptions.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

### [115] [Large Pre-Trained Models for Bimanual Manipulation in 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20579)
*Hanna Yurchyk,Wei-Di Chang,Gregory Dudek,David Meger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper uses attention maps from DINOv2—a Vision Transformer—to enhance bimanual robotic manipulation tasks, integrating these maps into a voxel-based behavior cloning policy for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve performance in bimanual robotic manipulation tasks by integrating high-level semantic cues obtained from pre-trained Vision Transformers.

Method: Attention maps from the pre-trained DINOv2 Vision Transformer are computed and interpreted as saliency scores for image pixels. These scores are lifted to 3D voxel grids and incorporated into a voxel-based behavior cloning policy for robotic manipulation.

Result: The integration of attention-guided voxel featurization improved task performance by an average of 8.2% (absolute) and 21.9% (relative) on the RLBench bimanual benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates that attention maps from pre-trained Vision Transformers can effectively yield semantic cues to enhance voxel-based robotic policies, validating its efficacy with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

### [116] [A Comparative Benchmark of Real-time Detectors for Blueberry Detection towards Precision Orchard Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20580)
*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 36 real-time object detector models, YOLO and RT-DETR families, for blueberry detection using a newly curated dataset featuring 85,879 labeled instances. Models were further improved with semi-supervised learning, and results were shared publicly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in natural blueberry detection due to varied lighting, occlusions, and device limitations, alongside the need for optimized detector models for practical scenarios.

Method: 1. Comparative benchmarking of 36 YOLO and RT-DETR model variants on a curated dataset of 661 images with 85,879 labeled blueberry instances. 
2. Fine-tuning with semi-supervised learning using Unbiased Mean Teacher on unlabeled data for performance enhancement.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved a mAP@50 of 93.3%. RT-DETRv2-X attained the highest mAP@50 at 93.6%, further improving to 94.8% after semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: RT-DETR-v2-X achieved the best performance after semi-supervised learning. Public dataset and software make this study a resource for further research, and it encourages exploring SSL for cross-domain data.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

### [117] [Region-of-Interest Augmentation for Mammography Classification under Patient-Level Cross-Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20585)
*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits Mini-DDSM mammogram data and introduces a ROI augmentation method, showing modest performance gains for breast cancer detection using deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer detection using mammography can significantly benefit from automation via deep learning, but limitations like small datasets and lower image resolutions hinder progress.

Method: The study proposes a region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy during training, which probabilistically replaces full images with cropped ROIs from a precomputed bounding-box bank for variability.

Result: Using ROI augmentation on the Mini-DDSM dataset led to modest ROC-AUC improvements, flat or slightly lower PR-AUC, and efficient training without inference-time changes.

Conclusion: ROI augmentation demonstrates simple, data-centric enhancement for mammography classification under constrained scenarios, avoiding extra labeling or architecture modifications.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores leveraging mirror reflections as auxiliary camera views for single-image multi-view stereo setups, simplifying the 3D reconstruction process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify 3D reconstruction by utilizing readily available mirror reflections in everyday environments as auxiliary views.

Method: The authors designed a transformation to generate physically valid virtual cameras from mirror reflections and implemented a symmetric-aware loss for pose refinement.

Result: Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show robust and generalizable 3D reconstruction using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The method exploits mirror reflections for effective single-image multi-view stereo setups, proving utility for static and dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Yiming Xiao,Archit Gupta,Miguel Esparza,Yu-Hsuan Ho,Antonia Sebastian,Hannah Weas,Rose Houck,Ali Mostafavi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FacadeTrack, a street-level framework for post-disaster building occupancy assessment, using panoramic video and interpretable attributes for decision-making strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Determining post-disaster building occupancy is critical for efficient triage, inspections, utility operations, and resource allocation.

Method: Developing FacadeTrack, a pipeline linking panoramic video to parcels to assess building habitability through interpretable attributes, using two decision strategies.

Result: The two-stage decision strategy achieves higher precision (0.927) and F1-score (0.848) compared to the one-stage strategy (precision of 0.943 but lower recall at 0.728 and F1-score at 0.822). Intermediate diagnostics highlight residual errors for improvement.

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides scalable, interpretable results for post-disaster occupancy assessment, aiding geospatial and emergency workflows.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [120] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how humans utilize semantic representations alongside visual features to interpret social interactions in animations of moving shapes. Findings indicate that semantic models, particularly verb-based embeddings, complement visual data to explain human judgments better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research emphasized visual features in interpreting social interactions. This study aims to uncover the semantic representations humans employ to enhance perception in such contexts.

Method: Two studies were conducted: (1) participants labeled animations based on their impressions of moving shapes, revealing distributed human responses, and (2) comparison of representational geometry of social interactions through human similarity judgments with model predictions derived from visual and semantic features.

Result: Semantic models, especially verb-based embeddings from animation descriptions, provided complementary information to visual features and accounted for human similarity judgments most effectively.

Conclusion: Human social perception integrates semantic structures reflecting social interactions, bridging the gap between visual and abstract representations.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EGS, a new framework for cross-view geo-localization (CVGL), tackling challenges in appearance variations and global-local consistency. Using a novel encoder and specialized graph structure, it achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in CVGL caused by severe appearance variations in UAV imagery, aiming to improve cross-domain generalization and reliable correspondence establishment.

Method: The method involves an E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for robustness to appearance variations and a graph model using a virtual super-node to ensure global-local consistency.

Result: EGS was tested on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks, showing significant performance improvements and setting new state-of-the-art records.

Conclusion: EGS offers a novel solution for CVGL with enhanced cross-domain generalization and consistency, outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection, tackling challenges of feature misalignment and sensitivity to cluttered backgrounds through enhanced semantic modeling and precise edge refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulty in detecting small infrared targets that blend into noisy and cluttered backgrounds due to their lack of distinctive features and low contrast.

Method: The proposed method uses a Dual-Path Edge Network with two paths: one for semantic modeling via Local and Global Self-Attention (leveraging Transformer architecture) and the other for edge enhancement using cascaded mathematical operators and attention-gated mechanisms.

Result: The method achieves precise detection and localization of small targets by combining robust structural semantic understanding with multi-scale edge refinement, while suppressing background noise.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the challenge of infrared small target detection, providing a unified framework with improved robustness, precision, and feature alignment through dual-path processing.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), focusing on predicting collective goals (group intentions) using a newly created basketball dataset (SHOT) and a forecasting model (GIFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intention recognition has been limited to individual intentions, neglecting the complexity of group settings. The motivation is to address this gap and understand how collective intentions emerge from individual actions and group dynamics.

Method: The authors create SHOT, a basketball-focused dataset with multi-view and multi-individual data, and propose GIFT, a framework that extracts individual features and models group dynamics to predict the emergence of group intentions.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the SHOT dataset and the GIFT framework, confirming their utility for exploring group intention forecasting.

Conclusion: SHOT and GIFT provide a solid foundation for future research on group intention forecasting, enabling a deeper understanding of collective behaviors and goals. The dataset has been made publicly available for further studies.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Maritime object detection faces challenges due to data scarcity and poor generalization. Neptune-X leverages synthetic data generation and dynamic sampling to enhance detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in maritime object detection caused by insufficient annotated data and the inability of models to generalize across diverse maritime scenarios.

Method: Neptune-X introduces X-to-Maritime, a generative model incorporating Bidirectional Object-Water Attention for better visual fidelity, and uses Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for task-relevant sample selection.

Result: Neptune-X sets a new benchmark in maritime scene synthesis and significantly improves detection accuracy, especially in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that synthetic data generation and intelligent sampling can effectively boost maritime object detection performance in underrepresented environments.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

TL;DR: The paper introduces STELLA, an end-to-end Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) pipeline tailored for long-term lunar mapping, tested rigorously with the CRESENT-365 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges associated with pose estimation during year-long lunar mapping missions, which involve sparse and variably-lit imagery unlike short-term descent missions.

Method: STELLA integrates components like Mask R-CNN crater detection, crater identification, a perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination for reliable lunar mapping.

Result: Experiments demonstrate STELLA's ability to achieve meter-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy under diverse viewing angles and illumination conditions using the CRESENT-365 dataset.

Conclusion: STELLA provides the first comprehensive solution for CBN in lunar mapping settings, delivering operational guidance for future missions and robust pose estimation over year-long campaigns.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how vision-only and language-only deep learning models, trained separately, align their semantic representations and how these alignments correlate with human preferences in image-text matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the point of convergence for semantic representations in vision-only and language-only models, the cues driving this alignment, its robustness, and its correlation with human preferences.

Method: Analyzed alignment peaks in layers of each model type, tested semantic robustness, conducted a forced-choice 'Pick-a-Pic' task, and evaluated the impact of averaging embeddings across exemplars.

Result: Alignment of representations peaks in mid-to-late layers, robust to appearance changes but collapses under semantic alteration. Models mirror human judgments in semantic distinctions and alignment amplifies with exemplar averaging.

Conclusion: Vision-only and language-only frameworks align semantically, reflecting human preferences. Semantic convergence strengthens with averaged embeddings, supporting this shared semantic code's robustness.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces 'FreeInsert,' a training-free image editing framework leveraging 3D geometric processing to overcome geometric control and style consistency challenges in object insertion within images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods struggle with geometric precision, style consistency, and efficient object insertion in customized image composition.

Method: The framework converts 2D objects into 3D, applies 3D edits, re-renders them into 2D images from specified views, and combines this geometric control with diffusion adapters for style consistency.

Result: FreeInsert ensures precise geometric control and style consistency during object insertion, producing more realistic and customized edited images.

Conclusion: FreeInsert advances image composition by introducing a practical and efficient method leveraging 3D geometry and diffusion techniques, enhancing control and realism without extensive training.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CustomEnhancer, a zero-shot enhancement pipeline for improving personalized human photo generation using diffusion models. It features a method named ResInversion for faster noise rectification, achieving significant performance gains in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from limitations in current text-to-image diffusion models, such as lower-quality scenes, lack of control, and poor identity representation.

Method: The method involves introducing CustomEnhancer, which uses triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach to manipulate latent spaces for personalized photo generation. It also integrates ResInversion to significantly speed up the noise rectification process.

Result: Experiments show CustomEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls, while ResInversion speeds up the inversion process by 129 times.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer unifies generation and reconstruction with efficient tools like ResInversion, addressing existing limitations in text-to-image models and offering precise control without the need for retraining.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

*Hyomin Choi,Heeji Han,Chris Rosewarne,Fabien Racapé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CompressAI-Vision, an evaluation platform for video compression optimized for computer vision tasks, suitable for 'remote' and 'split' inference scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing usage of NN-based computer vision applications, there is a growing need to optimize video compression for specific vision tasks while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The approach involves developing an open-source evaluation platform that integrates different coding tools and standards to assess compression efficiency and task accuracy across varied datasets.

Result: The study demonstrates the platform's ability to balance bit-rate efficiency and task accuracy, incorporating standard codecs and showing practical use-case suitability.

Conclusion: CompressAI-Vision provides a valuable open-source tool adopted by MPEG to advance Feature Coding for Machines, aiding the research in compression methods for computer vision.

Abstract: With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision

### [130] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework called dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) for tackling domain shifts in cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization in medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address domain shift challenges and minimize annotation costs in medical image segmentation, especially under more practical scenarios where labeled and unlabeled data face domain shifts simultaneously between training and testing phases.

Method: The DAC framework employs a co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross pseudo supervision, integrating feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary self-supervised tasks to mitigate domain shifts and prevent model collapse.

Result: Experimental results on medical datasets like Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM show that the DAC framework enhances generalizability, robustness, and domain-invariant discriminative feature learning.

Conclusion: The DAC framework provides a viable solution for improving domain generalization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, effectively addressing domain shift challenges and bolstering model stability.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEIMv2, an enhanced real-time DETR framework that spans from high-performance to ultra-lightweight models, achieving state-of-the-art detection results with impressive efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance-cost trade-off of real-time detection transformers (DETRs) across diverse hardware scenarios, from GPUs to mobile devices.

Method: The paper extends DEIM by integrating DINOv3 features, introduces a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) for multi-scale optimization, and adopts HGNetv2 for lightweight models. Simplified decoders and enhanced Dense O2O are used to balance efficiency and performance.

Result: DEIMv2 sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks, with the largest model achieving 57.8 AP using fewer parameters than its predecessors, and ultra-lightweight models like DEIMv2-Pico matching competitors with significantly fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 demonstrates superior efficiency and versatility across a range of scenarios, establishing itself as a new standard in performance-cost optimization for real-time object detection.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAC-LoRA, a framework integrating adversarial training into efficient fine-tuning of vision-language models, enhancing their robustness without harming accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are critical for applications in safety-sensitive domains but are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for robust adaptation mechanisms.

Method: The proposed method, DAC-LoRA, employs an intelligent adversarial curriculum that progressively intensifies attacks using a First-Order Stationary Condition and TRADES-inspired loss integrated into parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: DAC-LoRA substantially improves adversarial robustness of VLMs while maintaining their clean accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness within a standard PEFT pipeline.

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA offers a lightweight and generalizable framework to enhance the robustness of vision-language models, showing potential applicability across multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedDSPG, a generative approach for federated domain generalization using domain-specific soft prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated learning struggles with domain shifts among clients and inefficient generalization to unknown domains, especially with prompt learning.

Method: The approach involves generating domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) during training and leveraging a generative model that integrates content and domain knowledge to produce DSPs for unseen domains during inference.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance on multiple public datasets compared to previous baselines in federated domain generalization.

Conclusion: FedDSPG effectively enhances the generalization capability of federated models to unknown domains by generating diverse and domain-specific prompts, addressing gaps in existing methods.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the global issue of low back pain by developing a robust diagnostic model capable of jointly analyzing complex medical images and text.

Method: The authors use a multimodal contrastive language-image pretraining technique, employing advanced vision and text encoders to project MRI scans and text reports into a shared embedding space.

Result: LumbarCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to 95% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on classification tasks, outperforming previous models.

Conclusion: LumbarCLIP is a significant step in automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and lays a foundation for enhanced clinical decision support.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PoisonVID, the first black-box poisoning attack specifically targeting prompt-guided sampling in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs), achieving high success rates across various models and strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-guided sampling strategies for VideoLLMs, while effective for tasks like summarization and question answering, have unexplored vulnerabilities that need examination.

Method: PoisonVID employs a closed-loop optimization strategy using universal perturbations to manipulate frame relevance scores. It uses paraphrased harmful descriptions derived from a shadow VideoLLM and GPT-4o-mini.

Result: PoisonVID demonstrates an attack success rate of 82% - 99% across three prompt-guided sampling methods and three VideoLLMs.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the necessity for developing improved and safe prompt-guided sampling methods for VideoLLMs to mitigate such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Game of Regularizer (GoR), a learnable method for dynamically balancing task-specific and knowledge distillation objectives in quantization-aware training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses under low-bit quantization due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes.

Method: GoR uses two trainable parameters for adaptive loss weighting to reduce conflict between supervision signals and improve small quantized models' performance.

Result: GoR outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods across image classification, object detection, and large language model compression tasks, ensuring fast inference and maintaining full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: GoR provides a robust solution for compressing AI models efficiently for deployment on resource-constrained hardware, outperforming full-precision models under optimal conditions through an ensemble distillation framework.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge explored the effectiveness of large noisy datasets sourced from the internet against smaller trusted expert-verified datasets for training automated plant identification systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance automated plant identification at continental scales with a goal of accurately identifying 10,000 plant species using a database of over 1.1 million images.

Method: The challenge compared training models on a noisy, web-sourced dataset and a smaller, expert-verified dataset. Testing was conducted using data from the Pl@ntNet mobile application, which collects plant images globally.

Result: The paper assessed the resources, approaches, and participant contributions in the challenge to evaluate the viability of both dataset strategies.

Conclusion: Large, noisy datasets can potentially rival smaller, trusted datasets for training deep learning models, pushing the boundaries of automated plant identification systems.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research

TL;DR: The paper introduces TasselNetV4, a plant counting model that focuses on cross-species counting using an enhanced vision transformer and multi-branch box-aware local counters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant counting methods are species-specific, which is impractical given the biodiversity of plants and newly bred cultivars. A more generalized approach is needed for efficient and scalable counting.

Method: The approach extends the TasselNet framework with a vision transformer coupled with multi-branch box-aware local counters. This design enhances robustness across species, scales, and scenes.

Result: TasselNetV4 outperformed state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models in experiments on two datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, delivering superior accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 is a potential vision foundation model for generalized plant counting across scenes, scales, and species.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new semi-supervised model for OCT segmentation that uses a biomarker topology engine to improve accuracy and anatomical correctness for layers and lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving segmentation performance in retinal OCT scans, which is critical for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases like AMD, while addressing limitations in anatomical feasibility, layer-lesion interaction modeling, and topological correctness.

Method: The authors propose a semi-supervised approach augmented by a differentiable biomarker topology engine for ensuring anatomically plausible segmentations and a disentangled representation for spatial and style factors.

Result: The proposed model outperformed current state-of-the-art methods in both lesion and layer segmentation accuracy across multiple datasets and showed improved generalizability to pathological cases using partially labeled training data.

Conclusion: Anatomical constraints integrated into semi-supervised learning can provide accurate, robust, and physiologically trustworthy segmentations of retinal biomarkers, with potential applications in clinical diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Motivation: To evaluate the robustness and effectiveness of plant identification systems in real-world biodiversity monitoring scenarios.

Method: Conducted a large-scale identification challenge with 110K images from 1000 plant species, introducing open-set recognition evaluation to address unknown categories.

Result: Participants demonstrated various approaches to address identification and rejection of false positives from unknown categories.

Conclusion: The challenge emphasized the importance of open-set recognition for improving biodiversity monitoring applications and provided valuable insights into participant methodologies and system outcomes.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA enhances knowledge-based VQA by summarizing and reranking captions for better alignment with large language models (LLMs), surpassing previous approaches on key datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in KB-VQA where image captions often contain noise irrelevant to questions and LLMs struggle with complex reasoning and task comprehension.

Method: The approach involves using a pre-trained visual language model to generate captions, summarizing and reordering them to exclude irrelevant data, alongside contextual examples for improved task adaptability.

Result: SCRA-VQA achieves strong performance on OK-VQA (38.8% accuracy) and A-OKVQA (34.6% accuracy), surpassing prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: The caption-reranking process improves image-question understanding and reasoning via LLMs without requiring expensive end-to-end training, offering an efficient advancement in KB-VQA.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently

### [142] [The Unanticipated Asymmetry Between Perceptual Optimization and Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20878)
*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores the mismatch between image quality assessment (IQA) metrics and their effectiveness in perceptual optimization, revealing key insights on fidelity metrics, adversarial training, and the impact of discriminator design on optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between perceptual optimization objectives like fidelity and adversarial goals, and their effectiveness as IQA metrics, which has been under-researched.

Method: A systematic analysis of the asymmetry in optimization and IQA using fidelity and adversarial objectives, and an examination of the design of discriminators for optimization effectiveness.

Result: The paper identifies a misalignment between IQA performance and optimization effectiveness, highlights the limited transferability of discriminator representations, and shows the importance of discriminator architecture in improving detail reconstruction.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into the design of loss functions and IQA models, suggesting a more principled approach to perceptual optimization by considering the role of fidelity, adversarial objectives, and discriminator structure.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

### [143] [Integrating Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20884)
*Zhifei Li,Feng Qiu,Yiran Wang,Yujing Xia,Kui Xiao,Miao Zhang,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IOG-VQA, a novel model for Visual Question Answering (VQA) that combines self-attention for object interaction and GAN-based debiasing to enhance generalization and handle dataset biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQA models struggle with biases introduced during training, leading to poor generalization and reliance on superficial patterns.

Method: IOG-VQA integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention to capture complex visual relationships and a GAN-based debiasing framework to improve data distribution and model robustness.

Result: The model demonstrated superior performance on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets, effectively addressing biases and improving generalization.

Conclusion: Addressing visual object interactions and dataset biases is crucial for advancing VQA. The IOG-VQA model achieves this and sets a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

*Tristan S. W. Stevens,Oisín Nolan,Jean-Luc Robert,Ruud J. G. van Sloun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Nuclear Diffusion, a hybrid method combining low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling for video restoration. It is particularly applied to cardiac ultrasound dehazing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust principal component methods struggle to handle the variability in real video data due to their sparse component assumption. This limits their effectiveness in complex scenarios like medical imaging.

Method: Nuclear Diffusion integrates low-rank modeling with diffusion posterior sampling, balancing structured noise removal and preserving dynamic content in video sequences. It was evaluated in the context of cardiac ultrasound to show its efficacy.

Result: The approach enhanced dehazing in cardiac ultrasound, outperforming traditional RPCA in terms of contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic).

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness of combining model-based approaches with deep generative priors, offering improved video restoration, particularly in medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

*Shuqiao Liang,Jian Liu,Renzhang Chen,Quanlong Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic images from advanced models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs introduce artifacts during generation. This paper introduces FerretNet, a lightweight network, to detect these artifacts and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in detecting hyper-realistic synthetic images generated by advanced models, driven by the artifacts these images inherently contain.

Method: Analysis of latent distribution deviations and decoding-induced smoothing effects, leveraging local pixel dependencies through Markov Random Fields, leading to the development of a lightweight neural network, FerretNet.

Result: FerretNet achieves a remarkable 97.1% detection accuracy on an open-world synthetic image dataset spanning 22 generative models, outperforming existing methods by 10.6%.

Conclusion: FerretNet demonstrates an efficient and robust approach to detecting synthetic images, leveraging unique artifacts introduced in the generation process.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoTIF, a transformer-inspired framework that adapts Concept Bottleneck Models for video classification, highlighting the role of temporal dependencies and global/local concept importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend interpretability models like Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) from static image classification to videos, addressing complexities introduced by temporal dependencies.

Method: Propose MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), a transformer-inspired architecture that handles video sequences by assessing global concept importance, local concept relevance, and temporal dependencies across video frames.

Result: Demonstrates that concept-based modeling can be successfully applied to video data while preserving competitive performance and enhancing temporal interpretability.

Conclusion: MoTIF validates the extension of concept-based interpretability frameworks to videos, providing insights into temporal concept contributions and preserving classification efficacy.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Motivation: To address the lack of robust object detection frameworks for visible and thermal modalities under limited annotated data scenarios.

Method: Introduction of FSMODNet, which integrates visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention to enhance object detection in complex conditions.

Result: FSMODNet outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in few-shot multispectral object detection across two public datasets.

Conclusion: FSMODNet proves to be effective in low-data scenarios for object detection by leveraging cross-modality integration, indicating its potential in practical applications under complex environments.

detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,

*Julius Pesonen,Arno Solin,Eija Honkavaara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a particle filter method for 3D object localization using drone cameras in scenarios where traditional methods fail due to resource or depth constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of 3D object localization in scenarios with limited computational resources or distant objects, particularly in safety-critical tasks like wildfire monitoring.

Method: Utilize particle filters to localize single and multiple targets using camera poses and image segmentation, validated through 3D simulations and drone-based image sequences with GNSS-based pose estimates.

Result: Demonstrated that particle filters can effectively solve localization tasks in resource-constrained settings, showing flexibility and compatibility with existing image segmentation models.

Conclusion: The method provides a viable, adaptable, and computationally feasible solution for drone-based wildfire monitoring and similar tasks.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba, a new semantic segmentation model for remote sensing imagery, combines local detail scanning and global context for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation in remote sensing faces challenges like high resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales. Current methods like Vision Mamba lack sufficient capture of local features, motivating the development of SwinMamba.

Method: SwinMamba utilizes localized and global scanning via shifted windows inspired by the Swin Transformer. The first two stages focus on local features, while the latter two fuse global context.

Result: Experiments on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets show SwinMamba surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models.

Conclusion: SwinMamba effectively addresses limitations of prior models by integrating local textures and global viewpoints, improving segmentation accuracy for remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel pack-based MIL framework for computational pathology to improve training efficiency, accuracy, and manage extreme sequence length variations in whole slide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges arising from extreme sequence length variations, data heterogeneity, and limited supervision in computational pathology, which adversely affect training efficiency and model optimization.

Method: The proposed method involves packing variable-length feature sequences into fixed lengths for batched training, introducing a residual branch for multi-slide supervision using compositional hyperslides, and employing an attention-driven downsampler to reduce feature redundancy.

Result: The framework achieves up to 8% accuracy improvement while reducing training time by 88% as demonstrated in PANDA(UNI), showcasing effectiveness in computational pathology tasks.

Conclusion: The approach emphasizes the importance of addressing data challenges such as redundancy and heterogeneity in computational pathology, paving the way for advancements in the field by leveraging foundation models.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

*Akihisa Watanabe,Jiawei Ren,Li Siyao,Yichen Peng,Erwin Wu,Edgar Simo-Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SimDiff, a diffusion model that generates physically plausible human motions efficiently by integrating environmental parameters directly into the denoising process, eliminating the need for repeated simulator calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency of existing methods for generating physically plausible motion, which rely on computationally expensive simulator-based layers that cannot parallelize the process.

Method: SimDiff interprets simulator-based motion projection as a form of guidance and incorporates environmental parameters like gravity and wind into the denoising process of a diffusion model, removing the need for continuous simulator use during inference.

Result: SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently, provides fine-grained control over physical coefficients, and generalizes effectively to unseen environmental parameter combinations.

Conclusion: SimDiff achieves efficient and flexible motion generation with physical plausibility without recurring simulator calls, marking an advancement in character animation and virtual reality applications.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

*Bum Jun Kim,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to Gaussian noise and provides actionable design rules to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the architectural factors contributing to robustness in vision models against Gaussian noise and provide guidelines for improvement.

Method: Extensive evaluations conducted on 1,174 pretrained models paired with theoretical analyses explaining empirical findings.

Result: Identified four key design principles: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs outperform CLIP ViTs in robustness metrics.

Conclusion: The study disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, offers a theoretical framework, and provides practical guidelines for designing noise-resistant vision models.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically map the research landscape of scene graphs in surgery and identify key applications, advancements, and gaps.

Method: A PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review was conducted, analyzing developments like graph models and data usage in internal/external surgical views.

Result: Rapid growth in SG research with advancements in models, but highlighted a data divide between real-world and simulated environments.

Conclusion: Scene graphs are evolving as critical tools for improving surgical operations; however, issues like data annotation gaps need solutions to fully realize their potential.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and

industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FASTER, a framework for summarizing lengthy financial advisory podcast videos using multimodal analysis, including video and text extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in extracting concise and meaningful insights from long, multimodal financial advisory podcast videos, which are often difficult for users to process.

Method: FASTER employs a combination of technologies such as Whisper for transcription with speaker diarization, BLIP for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and a modified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function. These methods ensure high precision, relevance, and coherence in summaries. Additionally, a Fin-APT dataset of 470 videos is introduced for training and evaluation.

Result: FASTER demonstrates strong performance, robustness, and generalizability across various experiments when compared to existing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), proving its effectiveness in multimodal summarization tasks.

Conclusion: FASTER sets a new standard for multimodal summarization of financial advisory content, making it more accessible and actionable while laying the groundwork for further research in this domain.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

*Yue Duan,Lei Qi,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ASD, a framework for enabling the cold-start of SSL (self-supervised learning) learners in deep image clustering without requiring prerequisites like pretraining or a pretrained model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep clustering frameworks integrate SSL techniques but require significant prerequisites like pretraining or a trained model. This limits their flexibility and their ability to function as out-of-box solutions for image clustering tasks.

Method: ASD randomly samples pseudo-labeled data, performs instance-level classification, tracks prediction-based class transitions, assigns cluster-level labels, and triggers a general SSL learner for clustering directly on the unlabeled data.

Result: The proposed approach achieves superior performance across benchmarks, with minimal accuracy gaps (e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10) compared to SSL methods using ground-truth labels. Additionally, ASD enhances the performance of existing SSL-based clustering methods.

Conclusion: ASD provides a novel and flexible approach to initiating SSL learners for deep image clustering without prerequisites, demonstrating strong accuracy and compatibility with existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

### [157] [SiNGER: A Clearer Voice Distills Vision Transformers Further](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20986)
*Geunhyeok Yu,Sunjae Jeong,Yoonyoung Choi,Jaeseung Kim,Hyoseok Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SiNGER, a framework to suppress high-norm artifacts while preserving informative signals during knowledge distillation in Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformers, which dominate objectives and degrade representation quality in knowledge distillation.

Method: The paper presents a Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) framework, which employs a nullspace-guided perturbation refined with a LoRA-based adapter to effectively suppress artifacts while preserving teacher signal quality.

Result: The proposed SiNGER framework improves student models' performance on downstream tasks and results in significantly clearer and more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively resolves the trade-off between suppressing artifacts and preserving informative signals, offering a state-of-the-art solution for knowledge distillation in Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

*Qinqin He,Jiaqi Weng,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SNCE, a single neuron-targeted approach for erasing harmful content in text-to-image models while preserving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety risks in text-to-image models, specifically by removing harmful content without degrading image quality.

Method: Develop and train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse latent space where individual neurons represent semantic concepts. Identify harmful-concept neurons using a novel frequency scoring method and suppress them for precise concept erasure.

Result: SNCE demonstrates state-of-the-art results in erasing harmful concepts while maintaining generation capabilities for non-target concepts. It also exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SNCE method effectively addresses safety concerns in text-to-image generation, achieving precise concept removal and robustness without quality loss.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

*Andreas Gilson,Lukas Meyer,Oliver Scholz,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes KDSS, an advanced biological point cloud sub-sampling algorithm, targetting plant segmentation across varied species and modalities, without the need for input down-sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues in traditional plant organ segmentation methods, such as reliance on pre-processing, down-sampling, and limited species or sensor modality compatibility.

Method: Develop the KDSS algorithm for effective and sensor-agnostic biological point cloud sub-sampling. Combine KDSS with state-of-the-art segmentation models for testing.

Result: KDSS demonstrates satisfying segmentation outcomes across different sensor modalities (photogrammetry, laser triangulation, and LiDAR) and plant species, retaining full-resolution input.

Conclusion: KD-SS serves as a lightweight and resolution-retaining solution for plant organ segmentation, overcoming limitations tied to species-specific or modality-specific methods.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

### [160] [Background Prompt for Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21055)
*Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Yujie Mo,Liang Peng,Ping Hu,Xiaoshuang Shi,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mambo, a new framework for few-shot out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection that enhances robustness by leveraging refined background similarity and adaptive background patch extraction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing FG-BG decomposition methods for FS-OOD detection that rely excessively on local class similarity and fixed background patch extraction strategies.

Method: The authors propose the Mambo framework which learns a background prompt for background similarity, refines it using class similarity, and employs self-calibrated tuning to adaptively select background patches based on sample diversity.

Result: Experiments show that Mambo outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in OOD and near OOD detection tasks on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Mambo introduces innovative strategies for FG-BG decomposition, improving robustness and flexibility in FS-OOD detection, proving its efficiency and performance through empirical validation.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

*Naga Venkata Sai Jitin Jami,Thomas Altstidl,Jonas Mueller,Jindong Li,Dario Zanca,Bjoern Eskofier,Heike Leutheuser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for more representative dataset splitting in image segmentation tasks, addressing the biases introduced by random sampling. Methods include Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) and a novel genetic algorithm called Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random dataset splitting in image segmentation often results in biased evaluations and poor generalization due to unrepresentative test sets. Addressing label distribution imbalance is critical, particularly in segmentation tasks with multi-label structures and imbalances.

Method: The paper introduces two methods: IPS, a label-aware sampling technique, and WDES, a genetic algorithm designed to minimize Wasserstein distance for optimal dataset split similarity. WDES is proven to be globally optimal with sufficient generations.

Result: WDES outperforms random sampling and produces more representative splits, as verified using new statistical heterogeneity metrics. Its applicability lowers performance variance and improves evaluation across multiple segmentation tasks, particularly benefiting small or imbalanced datasets.

Conclusion: The introduced WDES and IPS methods effectively address dataset splitting issues in segmentation tasks by improving representativeness and reducing biases, enhancing evaluation metrics and model generalization.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

*Riccardo La Grassa,Ignazio Gallo,Nicola Landro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EnGraf-Net, a fine-grained classification model using hierarchical semantic associations as supervised signals, outperforming many current models without relying on manual annotations or cropping techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing fine-grained classification models that rely on part annotations or attention maps and provide an improved approach that captures local and semantic features effectively.

Method: The proposed EnGraf-Net model incorporates hierarchical semantic associations (taxonomy) as supervised signals for object classification, and it trains this framework in an end-to-end manner without the need for part annotations or cropping techniques.

Result: EnGraf-Net demonstrated superior performance on three datasets (CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft), outperforming many traditional models and competing with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: EnGraf-Net offers a robust and annotation-free framework for fine-grained classification, utilizing hierarchical structures to achieve competitive and improved results over traditional methods, paving the way for improved semantic-driven classification approaches.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores vulnerabilities of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to adversarial patches designed using geometric distortions, achieving significant attack success rates across various ViTs on a binary person classification task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to examine the security of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which, despite their advantages over CNNs, remain vulnerable to evasion attacks such as adversarial patches.

Method: The researchers used a Creases Transformation (CT) technique to design adversarial patches that introduce subtle, realistic distortions and evaluated their success rates in misclassifying person vs. non-person classifications across four ViT models.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows varying attack success rates among the ViT models, ranging from 40.04% to 99.97%. Pre-training dataset scale and methodology significantly influenced the resilience of these models.

Conclusion: The study highlights that ViTs share vulnerabilities with CNNs in the context of adversarial attacks and underscores the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches while emphasizing the impact of pre-training data choices on model robustness.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

*Guojun Lei,Rong Zhang,Chi Wang,Tianhang Liu,Hong Li,Zhiyuan Ma,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniTransfer introduces a novel architecture for controllable video concept transfer using spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition. It achieves high quality and precision in video edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance video concept transfer by enabling finely controlled modifications to video components and improving decomposed representation learning from large-scale unlabeled video data.

Method: UniTransfer employs spatial decomposition by decoupling videos into foreground, background, and motion, alongside a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture. It also uses Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanisms for timestep decomposition guided by large language models. Self-supervised pretraining with random masking further refines representation learning.

Result: Experiments show that UniTransfer outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity and editability for video concept transfer, achieving precise manipulation across diverse images and scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed UniTransfer architecture delivers powerful and controllable video concept transfer capabilities, offering significant advancements in visual editing and manipulation, supported by a novel dataset for benchmarking.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS)" to improve multimodal large language model (MLLM) reasoning using iterative perception during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in MLLMs rely on static perception stages that limit reasoning abilities; thus, a dynamic, human-like approach to reasoning is needed.

Method: VTTS employs an Iterative Perception mechanism guided by reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal supervision, refining focus progressively during inference. Additionally, a new dataset VTTS-80K supports this method.

Result: The Videochat-R1.5 model, incorporating VTTS, demonstrated over 5% improvements in reasoning, perception, and other tasks compared to strong baselines like Qwen2.5VL.

Conclusion: VTTS enhances the perceptual processing capability of MLLMs, enabling significant advancements in diverse benchmarks for video reasoning and multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mammo-CLIP Dissect, a framework for analyzing deep-learning models in mammography, focusing on their learned textual concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how deep-learning models reason in mammography by analyzing their learned textual concepts rather than limiting the analysis to pixel-based explainability.

Method: The approach utilizes Mammo-CLIP, a mammography-specific vision-language model, to label neurons with human-interpretable textual concepts and assess their alignment with domain knowledge.

Result: Models trained on mammography data capture clinically relevant concepts and align with radiologists' workflows, with task-specific fine-tuning enhancing some concept categories but reducing others.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides a new way to evaluate how deep learning models learn mammography-specific knowledge, revealing trade-offs in concept specialization and generality.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: This paper introduces MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework using Dynamic Time Warping for improving the reasoning consistency of multimodal large language models for video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models struggle with process inconsistency in video reasoning, which affects interpretability and robustness.

Method: Proposes MOSS-ChatV framework, leveraging Dynamic Time Warping-based process rewards and constructing a benchmark (MOSS-Video) with annotated reasoning traces.

Result: MOSS-ChatV achieved strong results (87.2% on MOSS-Video test) and showed consistent gains across various architectures and video benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances reasoning trace consistency and demonstrates broad applicability and improved performance in video reasoning.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

*Guojun Lei,Chi Wang,Yikai Wang,Hong Li,Ying Song,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to generate videos guided by camera trajectories by integrating motions of both camera and objects, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating videos based on specified camera trajectories is challenging due to the need for consistency and generalizability, especially when handling both camera and object motions.

Method: The approach converts camera and object motions into pixel motions using a stable diffusion network. It learns reference motion maps corresponding to camera trajectories, which are combined with semantic object priors and input into an image-to-video network.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: The model achieves accurate video generation aligned with designated camera trajectories while ensuring object motion consistency, providing a significant improvement over existing techniques.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: The paper explores when image discriminators are disadvantaged in separating synthetic from real images, focusing on data dimensionality and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions where image discriminators struggle due to advancements in image generative AI.

Method: The study analyzes data using factors of dimensionality and Kolmogorov complexity as measures of dataset structure.

Result: Simple and highly complex datasets hinder discriminator effectiveness, while intermediate complexity enables better detection of synthetic images.

Conclusion: Intermediate data complexity offers the best scenario for detecting synthetic images, as generators fail to capture distributions entirely.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAVECLIP is a model enabling adaptive resolution inference for CLIP using wavelet-based tokenization, saving computation while retaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for computationally efficient models that support dynamic resolution adjustments in image processing tasks.

Method: WAVECLIP uses multi-level wavelet decomposition for adaptive resolution inference, combined with caching and cross-level attention mechanisms for efficiency.

Result: The model demonstrated competitive accuracy in zero-shot classification while providing significant computational savings.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP effectively balances compute-accuracy trade-offs using a unified model, making it both adaptable and resource-efficient.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

*Aymen Bouguerra,Daniel Montoya,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Fabio Arnez,Chokri Mraidha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of quantization on CLIP vision-language models, analyzing its effects on accuracy, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, with surprising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored impact of quantization on the performance and reliability of vision-language models like CLIP, beyond mere accuracy considerations.

Method: The authors conducted a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing in-distribution accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and applying quantization-aware training (QAT) methods.

Result: Quantization improved calibration for underconfident models but degraded calibration for overconfident ones, while still enabling gains in OOD detection. Specific QAT methods showed simultaneous improvements in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness.

Conclusion: The study challenges the conventional belief in a strict trade-off between efficiency and performance, highlighting quantization as a tool to enhance multiple objectives in deploying reliable and robust VLMs.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,Shayan Baghayi Nejad,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARINOX is a unified framework that improves compositional alignment in text-to-image diffusion models by combining noise optimization and exploration, along with principled reward selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of compositional misalignment in text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion, especially when faced with complex prompts involving object relationships and spatial arrangements.

Method: The proposed method, CARINOX, integrates initial noise optimization and exploration, supplemented by a systematic reward selection process that aligns with human judgment metrics.

Result: CARINOX demonstrates a significant improvement in compositional alignment, boosting scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.

Conclusion: CARINOX successfully addresses intrinsic limitations of existing techniques, offering a reliable framework for enhancing compositional alignment across diverse scenarios without sacrificing image quality or diversity.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

### [173] [TABLET: A Large-Scale Dataset for Robust Visual Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21205)
*Iñigo Alonso,Imanol Miranda,Eneko Agirre,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents TABLET, a dataset of 4 million examples for visual table understanding (VTU), offering original visualizations and paired metadata to enhance VTU model training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTU benchmarks rely on synthetic and visually simple tables, limiting progress in understanding real-world table complexities.

Method: The researchers created TABLET, incorporating paired image-HTML representations, metadata, and provenance data from 2 million unique tables with 88% preserving original visualizations.

Result: Fine-tuned vision-language models on TABLET showed improved performance on both familiar and new VTU tasks, along with enhanced robustness on real-world visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET provides a robust, scalable dataset essential for advancing training and evaluation of future VTU models, addressing limitations of traditional synthetic datasets.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

### [174] [Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21209)
*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel conformal prediction method improves feature attribution explanations for image-based predictions by ensuring fidelity and eliminating dependence on ground-truth explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature attribution methods often lack robustness and fail to reliably represent the reasoning behind black-box model predictions.

Method: The paper introduces a conformal prediction approach that ensures a subset of salient features preserves the model prediction, independent of excluded features, using four proposed conformity functions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on six datasets using five explainers shows that FastSHAP outperforms other methods in fidelity and explanation efficiency, with super-pixel measures yielding better results than pixel-wise counterparts.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the reliability and compactness of feature attribution explanations, advancing their fidelity in image-based predictions.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

### [175] [Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21223)
*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma introduces a skeleton-based unified framework for sign language understanding, addressing semantic grounding, local-global context balance, and cross-modal learning challenges. Sigma achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple SLU tasks and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address limitations in current sign language understanding methods, which include weak semantic grounding, imbalance between local details and global context, and inefficient cross-modal learning.

Method: Sigma incorporates three key strategies: 1) a sign-aware early fusion mechanism to integrate visual and textual modalities; 2) hierarchical alignment learning to capture both fine-grained details and high-level relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Sigma achieves state-of-the-art performance in isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks and languages.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that semantically informative pre-training and skeletal data are robust and effective for sign language understanding tasks, offering a significant advancement in SLU modeling.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

### [176] [Evaluating the Evaluators: Metrics for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21227)
*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper critiques the widely used metrics for text-to-image generation evaluation, finding inconsistency across tasks and urging careful metric selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether existing metrics for text-to-image generation evaluation align well with human judgments, given their pivotal role in driving research progress.

Method: A broad study of various popular evaluation metrics across a range of compositional challenges, analyzing their behavior and correlation with human judgments.

Result: Finds no single metric performs consistently; while embedding-based metrics outperform in specific scenarios, VQA-based metrics are popular but not universally superior.

Conclusion: Metric selection should be conducted carefully and transparently to ensure trustworthy evaluations and effective usage as reward models in text-to-image generation tasks.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

*Shakib Khan,Fariba Dambandkhameneh,Nazim Shaikh,Yao Nie,Raghavan Venugopal,Xiao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SlideMamba, a deep learning framework combining Mamba and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for robust Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis in pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve computational pathology by effectively utilizing both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies in WSIs.

Method: Integration of Mamba architecture and GNNs, with an entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy to dynamically balance predictive contributions.

Result: SlideMamba outperformed prior methods across metrics such as PRAUC (0.751 \pm 0.05), ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity, and specificity.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture demonstrates strong performance and flexibility for spatially-resolved predictive tasks, enhancing computational pathology capabilities.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified framework enabling fine-grained and controllable 3D asset generation using various conditioning signals like point clouds, voxels, and skeletal poses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations in current 3D-native generative models, which lack fine-grained cross-modal controls, thereby limiting their practicality in asset creation.

Method: The proposed method integrates multiple input modalities (e.g., images, point clouds, and skeletal poses) in a single cross-modal architecture while employing a difficulty-aware sampling strategy to train the model effectively.

Result: The approach enhances generation accuracy, allows geometry-aware transformations, and improves robustness for practical production workflows.

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni provides a robust and versatile framework for 3D asset creation, offering enhanced control and utility across diverse production scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable method to guide CNN attention using automatically generated semantic attention maps from vision-language models, without requiring manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often rely on superficial correlations for predictions, raising concerns about their reasoning process. Existing methods to address this problem require labor-intensive annotations, which limit scalability.

Method: The authors leverage vision-language models to generate semantic attention maps via natural language prompts. An auxiliary loss aligns CNN attention to these language-guided maps, enhancing decision-making without manual annotations.

Result: The method achieved state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remained competitive on DecoyMNIST against annotation-heavy baselines, showing stronger generalization and reduced reliance on shortcuts.

Conclusion: This research shows that guiding CNN attention using language-based automatic methods enables more reliable and human-like decision-making, demonstrating its potential to address shortcut learning effectively.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of data scarcity and narrow focus in current machine learning applications for MRI, despite MRI's importance in clinical and research domains.

Method: The authors developed Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language model trained using a combination of self-supervised vision learning and text supervision, with a modular design to support lightweight task adaptation.

Result: Decipher-MR demonstrated superior performance compared to existing models across multiple benchmarks, including disease classification and cross-modal retrieval.

Conclusion: Decipher-MR sets a new standard for scalable, generalizable foundation models in MRI-based AI, enabling efficient development across diverse clinical and research tasks.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for
MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research

TL;DR: The paper introduces SQ-InstructBLIP, a model designed to improve reasoning in vision-language tasks by iteratively generating and leveraging image-aware sub-questions and sub-answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often struggle with multi-step reasoning, and existing methods using LLMs face limitations such as reliance on black-box mechanisms and inability to interpret fine-grained visual details.

Method: The proposed solution, SQ-InstructBLIP, employs a three-component architecture: Questioner (generates sub-questions), Answerer (provides sub-answers), and Reasoner (performs reasoning) to iteratively build better understanding of questions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate SQ-InstructBLIP outperforms previous methods in visual question answering by effectively using sub-questions to improve accuracy.

Conclusion: SQ-InstructBLIP introduces a new paradigm for tackling multi-step reasoning in vision-language tasks, providing both better interpretability and performance.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses hallucination in text-to-image (T2I) generative models, proposing a taxonomy with three categories to improve evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clear framing and evaluation criteria for hallucination in T2I generative models and highlight biases that go beyond prompt alignment.

Method: The authors define hallucination for T2I models as bias-driven deviations and introduce a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.

Result: The taxonomy serves as an upper bound for evaluation and reveals hidden biases in T2I models, enhancing the assessment process.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy provides a structured foundation for evaluating T2I generative models, enabling a better understanding of their biases and hallucination tendencies.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Jinyang Huang,Anyang Tong,Ziyu Jia,Jie Zhang,Zhi Liu,Dan Guo,Jianwei Lu,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for micro-action recognition focused on overcoming inter-person variability using person-agnostic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-action recognition methods struggle in real-world applications because inter-person variability leads to significant differences in how actions are expressed. This challenge undermines the generalization and robustness of current approaches.

Method: The framework includes two components: a Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module to normalize person-specific traits at the feature level, and a Group-Invariant Regularized Loss aimed at enhancing generalization by simulating unseen person-specific distributions at the loss level.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed existing methods in accuracy and robustness on the large-scale MA-52 dataset, achieving stable performance under fine-grained conditions.

Conclusion: The integration of Distributionally Robust Optimization principles and the two proposed components effectively address inter-person variability, improving the generalization and robustness of micro-action recognition methods in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve semantic matching by leveraging features from a 3D geometric foundation model (VGGT), addressing limitations in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two challenges in pixel-level correspondence: (1) geometric ambiguity from using 2D model features and (2) the nearest-neighbor matching rule ignoring cross-image invisibility and manifold preservation.

Method: The approach modifies VGGT by retaining early features, fine-tuning later stages, adding a semantic matching head, adopting cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and mitigating aliasing artifacts.

Result: Experiments show improved geometry awareness, matching reliability, and preservation of feature manifold over previous methods.

Conclusion: The presented method effectively addresses existing limitations in semantic matching and sets a new benchmark with geometry-aware and holistic results.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

*Xinyu Liu,Guolei Sun,Cheng Wang,Yixuan Yuan,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVSR is a framework designed to improve the resolution of medical videos, addressing challenges like noise and misalignment while preserving tissue and organ structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the limitations of low-resolution medical videos, which hinder accurate diagnosis due to hardware constraints and issues like camera shake and optical flow errors.

Method: MedVSR introduces two key components: Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) for precise frame alignment and Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) for artifact reduction and improved tissue structure reconstruction.

Result: MedVSR has demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to existing video super-resolution models across four medical video datasets, including endoscopy and cataract surgeries.

Conclusion: MedVSR provides a significant advancement in medical video resolution enhancement and holds potential to improve diagnostic accuracy by mitigating artifacts and alignment issues in medical videos.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

### [186] [MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and Open Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21268)
*Sicong Leng,Jing Wang,Jiaxi Li,Hao Zhang,Zhiqiang Hu,Boqiang Zhang,Yuming Jiang,Hang Zhang,Xin Li,Lidong Bing,Deli Zhao,Wei Lu,Yu Rong,Aixin Sun,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses key challenges in multimodal reasoning models by introducing Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) to stabilize reinforcement learning (RL), releasing high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets, and providing open-source models and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to overcome two major limitations in multimodal reasoning models: the lack of large-scale high-quality CoT data and the instability of RL algorithms during fine-tuning.

Method: The authors introduced Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) based on a Variance Promotion Score (VPS) to improve reward variance in RL optimization. They complemented this with large-scale CoT datasets and reproducible code to ensure community adoption.

Result: The method effectively stabilized RL fine-tuning and enhanced multimodal reasoning performance, as validated through mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The proposed data and sampling strategy were shown to improve optimization signals and convergence.

Conclusion: The work provided theoretical and practical advancements in RL optimization, released valuable resources for multimodal reasoning, and set standardized benchmarks to facilitate future research in the community.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a new foundation AI model, Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer, for marine monitoring using Sentinel-3 OLCI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ocean science AI applications struggle with sparse and expensive labelled data, necessitating models that can utilize limited datasets effectively.

Method: Pre-trained the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer to reconstruct Sentinel-3 OLCI data and fine-tuned it on downstream marine observation tasks, including chlorophyll concentration and ocean primary production estimation.

Result: The model successfully leveraged small high-quality labelled datasets to capture detailed ocean colour patterns and match point observations, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: Foundation models like Prithvi-EO have significant potential to improve geospatial AI applications for better understanding ocean ecosystems and their role in climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

### [188] [Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21278)
*Shilin Lu,Zhuming Lian,Zihan Zhou,Shaocong Zhang,Chen Zhao,Adams Wai-Kin Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHINE, a training-free framework for high-fidelity and seamless image composition under complex lighting and high-resolution challenges. The method utilizes modern text-to-image diffusion models with new techniques and proposes a new benchmark called ComplexCompo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image composition models struggle with handling complex lighting scenarios like shadows, reflections, and working with diverse high-resolution images. Current approaches often lead to artifacts or inappropriate object alignment in the generated output.

Method: SHINE is a training-free framework incorporating manifold-steered anchor loss for maintaining subject and background integrity. It uses degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending to improve quality and seamlessness. Pretrained customization adapters help refine the latent representations without the need for inversion or brittle edits.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench benchmarks, both under standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned perceptual scores (DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SHINE proves to effectively address the issues of prior models, enhancing image fidelity and realism under challenging conditions. The introduction of ComplexCompo as a benchmark also contributes to the field by providing a more rigorous evaluation framework.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

*Weilun Feng,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Chuanguang Yang,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces QuantVGGT, a quantization framework for visual geometry grounded transformers (VGGTs), addressing computational and memory challenges with innovative techniques for compression and acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the computational and memory constraints in deploying large-scale VGGTs in real-world applications, leveraging quantization to improve their efficiency while maintaining performance.

Method: The method involves two key contributions: (1) Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization, which combines Hadamard rotation and local channel smoothing to manage heavy-tailed distributions and reduce inter-channel variance; (2) Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which uses statistical filtering and frame-aware sampling for stable quantization calibration.

Result: QuantVGGT outperforms previous quantization methods with improved accuracy and efficiency, achieving 3.7x memory reduction, 2.5x speedup, and maintaining over 98% reconstruction accuracy compared to full-precision models.

Conclusion: The results validate the practicality of QuantVGGT in resource-constrained environments, suggesting significant benefits for deploying VGGTs in real hardware without major performance compromises.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen integrates physical principles into text-to-video generation to improve realism and control over motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack precise control due to learning motion solely from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.

Method: NewtonGen incorporates Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) to model and predict physical motions, combining data-driven synthesis with dynamical constraints.

Result: The framework generates physically consistent video synthesis with the ability to fine-tune dynamics based on specific parameters.

Conclusion: NewtonGen enhances realism and controllability in text-to-video generation by embedding physical understanding into the process.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Motivation: The goal is to make advanced generative AI, specifically high-quality image generation, practical and accessible across all types of consumer devices, overcoming limitations of computationally-heavy models.

Method: This framework uses a few-step distillation method tailored for efficient image generation with specific innovations like "timestep sharing" and "split-timestep fine-tuning," combined with optimizations such as text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization.

Result: The SD3.5-Flash consistently surpasses existing few-step methods in terms of generation speed and memory efficiency, validated through evaluations and user studies.

Conclusion: The framework democratizes advanced generative AI accessibility, enabling high-quality image generation on diverse hardware, bridging the gap between computational requirements and device capabilities.

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing availability of open medical imaging datasets and their vital role in ensuring the accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic AI, while identifying shortcomings in how these datasets are governed and curated.

Method: The authors conducted an analysis of publicly available machine learning datasets on platforms like Kaggle and HuggingFace, highlighting their limitations by comparing datasets across dimensions such as sharing, documentation, and maintenance.

Result: The analysis revealed weaknesses such as vague licensing, lack of persistent identifiers and long-term data storage, duplicate entries, and missing metadata, with variations observed between different platforms.

Conclusion: The paper underlines the need for improved practices in dataset governance on community platforms to ensure responsible curation. It advocates for higher standards in dataset documentation and sharing, particularly for healthcare-related AI.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

TL;DR: FZModules is a framework creating custom compression pipelines to handle large scientific data while maintaining efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern scientific simulations generate massive datasets that challenge memory and storage capability, necessitating efficient and tailored compression solutions.

Method: FZModules uses a heterogeneous framework with modular design and asynchronous task-backed execution to create error-bounded compression pipelines.

Result: The framework compares favorably in speed and rate-distortion with existing CPU, GPU, and hybrid compressors when tested on multiple scientific datasets.

Conclusion: FZModules enables rapid and customized design of compression pipelines, balancing scalability, speed, and fidelity across diverse data needs.

Abstract: Modern scientific simulations and instruments generate data volumes that
overwhelm memory and storage, throttling scalability. Lossy compression
mitigates this by trading controlled error for reduced footprint and throughput
gains, yet optimal pipelines are highly data and objective specific, demanding
compression expertise. GPU compressors supply raw throughput but often
hard-code fused kernels that hinder rapid experimentation, and underperform in
rate-distortion. We present FZModules, a heterogeneous framework for assembling
error-bounded custom compression pipelines from high-performance modules
through a concise extensible interface. We further utilize an asynchronous
task-backed execution library that infers data dependencies, manages memory
movement, and exposes branch and stage level concurrency for powerful
asynchronous compression pipelines. Evaluating three pipelines built with
FZModules on four representative scientific datasets, we show they can compare
end-to-end speedup of fused-kernel GPU compressors while achieving similar
rate-distortion to higher fidelity CPU or hybrid compressors, enabling rapid,
domain-tailored design.

Result: Identified practical insights and challenges for running GenAI workloads in HPC environments, with implications for future tool development.

Conclusion: The research bridges the gap between HPC and cloud computing for GenAI, offering guidance for advancing containerized workloads in HPC settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance and scalability limitations in distributed sparse matrix operations related to permutation, extraction, and assignment.

Method: Adopt an Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy to minimize communication and use synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms for fast local computations.

Result: The new algorithms outperform existing solutions like CombBLAS and PETSc in various application scenarios on multiple HPC systems.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer significant computational advantages and expand capabilities for sparse matrix operations in distributed-memory settings.

Abstract: We present scalable distributed-memory algorithms for sparse matrix
permutation, extraction, and assignment. Our methods follow an
Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy where each process identifies the local
nonzeros to be sent, exchanges the required data, and then builds its local
submatrix from the received elements. This approach reduces communication
compared to SpGEMM-based methods in distributed memory. By employing
synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms, we further accelerate local
computations, achieving substantially better performance than existing
libraries such as CombBLAS and PETSc. We design efficient software for these
operations and evaluate their performance on two university clusters and the
Perlmutter supercomputer. Our experiments span a variety of application
scenarios, including matrix permutation for load balancing, matrix reordering,
subgraph extraction, and streaming graph applications. In all cases, we compare
our algorithms against CombBLAS, the most comprehensive distributed library for
these operations, and, in some scenarios, against PETSc. Overall, this work

TL;DR: The study evaluates the performance of RADICAL-Pilot (RP) in combination with Flux and Dragon, demonstrating improvements in executing hybrid AI-HPC workloads compared to traditional srun/Slurm launchers.


<details>

Motivation: Traditional launchers like Slurm's srun face limitations in handling dynamic and heterogeneous workloads characteristic of modern scientific workflows that combine HPC and machine-learning tasks.

Method: Integrating RADICAL-Pilot (RP) with advanced runtime systems like Flux and Dragon to achieve hierarchical resource management and high-throughput function execution, followed by performance characterization using synthetic and production-scale workloads.

Result: RP+Flux achieved up to 930 tasks/s, while RP+Flux+Dragon exceeded 1,500 tasks/s with over 99.6% utilization. Comparatively, srun peaked at only 152 tasks/s and showed reduced utilization below 50%. For drug discovery workloads, RP+Flux reduced makespan by 30-60% and quadrupled throughput.

Conclusion: Hybrid runtime integration using RP, Flux, and Dragon offers a scalable and efficient solution for executing hybrid AI-HPC workloads, significantly outperforming traditional launchers like srun/Slurms in task throughput and utilization.

Abstract: Scientific workflows increasingly involve both HPC and machine-learning
tasks, combining MPI-based simulations, training, and inference in a single
execution. Launchers such as Slurm's srun constrain concurrency and throughput,
making them unsuitable for dynamic and heterogeneous workloads. We present a
performance study of RADICAL-Pilot (RP) integrated with Flux and Dragon, two
complementary runtime systems that enable hierarchical resource management and
high-throughput function execution. Using synthetic and production-scale
workloads on Frontier, we characterize the task execution properties of RP
across runtime configurations. RP+Flux sustains up to 930 tasks/s, and
RP+Flux+Dragon exceeds 1,500 tasks/s with over 99.6% utilization. In contrast,
srun peaks at 152 tasks/s and degrades with scale, with utilization below 50%.
For IMPECCABLE.v2 drug discovery campaign, RP+Flux reduces makespan by 30-60%
relative to srun/Slurm and increases throughput more than four times on up to
1,024. These results demonstrate hybrid runtime integration in RP as a scalable

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'tail batching,' a strategy to enhance GPU efficiency during synchronous RL training for LLMs. By consolidating long-tail responses, it accelerates training without compromising accuracy, demonstrated by the RollPacker system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU underutilization in synchronous RL post-training arises from imbalanced response lengths, leading to inefficiencies. Current solutions often sacrifice training accuracy to address this issue.

Method: The paper proposes 'tail batching,' which schedules long-tail responses separately during rollout steps to reduce GPU idle time. It introduces RollPacker, a system optimizing parallelism, resource allocation, and training streams.

Result: RollPacker achieves significant training time reduction, with 2.03x-2.56x improvement over veRL and up to 2.24x over RLHFuse for Qwen2.5 LLMs using 128 H800 GPUs.

Conclusion: Tail batching in RollPacker accelerates RL training for LLMs while maintaining accuracy, making it a substantial improvement in GPU utilization and post-training efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU
underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths
within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by
relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this
paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for
synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail
responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring
that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short
rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them
into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle
time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without
sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the
benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL
stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation
and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show
that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction
compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5
family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper discusses optimizing the GPU-based assembly of Schur complement matrices in FETI methods by leveraging sparsity to reduce overhead, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating the computation of Schur complement matrices, essential in domain decomposition methods on GPU-based high-performance clusters, to handle complex engineering problems efficiently.

Method: Utilizing the sparsity of input matrices to enhance the GPU assembly process, reducing the computational expense and overhead associated with explicit matrix assembly.

Result: A speedup of 5.1x in the GPU-specific code and 3.3x for the entire assembly was demonstrated, making the process efficient from as few as 10 iterations.

Conclusion: Wise utilization of matrix sparsity improves GPU assembly for Schur complements, leading to considerable acceleration and reduced computational overhead in FETI methods.

Abstract: Schur complement matrices emerge in many domain decomposition methods that
can solve complex engineering problems using supercomputers. Today, as most of
the high-performance clusters' performance lies in GPUs, these methods should
also be accelerated.
  Typically, the offloaded components are the explicitly assembled dense Schur
complement matrices used later in the iterative solver for multiplication with
a vector. As the explicit assembly is expensive, it represents a significant
overhead associated with this approach to acceleration. It has already been
shown that the overhead can be minimized by assembling the Schur complements
directly on the GPU.
  This paper shows that the GPU assembly can be further improved by wisely
utilizing the sparsity of the input matrices. In the context of FETI methods,
we achieved a speedup of 5.1 in the GPU section of the code and 3.3 for the
whole assembly, making the acceleration beneficial from as few as 10

*William F. Godoy,Tatiana Melnichenko,Pedro Valero-Lara,Wael Elwasif,Philip Fackler,Rafael Ferreira Da Silva,Keita Teranishi,Jeffrey S. Vetter*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This study explores the Mojo programming language's performance and portability for GPU-based scientific computing, comparing Mojo's efficiency with CUDA and HIP across diverse workloads on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to assess Mojo's ability to enhance performance and productivity for GPU-based scientific computing, addressing gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem.

Method: The study evaluates Mojo's performance across four scientific workloads on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs and makes comparisons with vendor-specific CUDA and HIP baselines.

Result: Mojo shows competitive performance for memory-bound tasks but exhibits shortcomings in fast-math compute-bound tasks and atomic operations on AMD GPUs.

Conclusion: While Mojo demonstrates promise in scientific computing, its programming requirements remain low-level, and challenges persist for certain GPU workloads. It offers potential to unify Python's fragmented ecosystem for scientific computing and AI.

Abstract: We explore the performance and portability of the novel Mojo language for
scientific computing workloads on GPUs. As the first language based on the
LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure,
Mojo aims to close performance and productivity gaps by combining Python's
interoperability and CUDA-like syntax for compile-time portable GPU
programming. We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil
(memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and
Hartree-Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their
performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We
show that Mojo's performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memory-bound
kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math
compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Although the learning curve
and programming requirements are still fairly low-level, Mojo can close
significant gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem in the convergence of
scientific computing and AI.

*Huynh Q. N. Vo,Md Tawsif Rahman Chowdhury,Paritosh Ramanan,Gozde Tutuncuoglu,Junchi Yang,Feng Qiu,Murat Yildirim*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method for solving large-scale optimization problems using RRAM-based in-memory computing, achieving significant gains in energy efficiency and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need for efficient computation alternatives as traditional architectures fail to meet the demands of increasingly complex computational workloads.

Method: The paper introduces a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specially tailored for RRAM arrays, minimizing write cycles and addressing device-specific issues.

Result: The RRAM-based system demonstrated comparable accuracy to GPU-accelerated solvers but achieved up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency.

Conclusion: This study establishes the potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for optimizing large-scale problems, highlighting the transformative capabilities of RRAM-based in-memory computing.

Abstract: The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the
capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by
fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising
alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency
and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional
architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained
optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains
cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory
primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays
of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates
robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric
block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We
integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate
performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against
GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our
RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of
magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results
demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the
transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving
large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.

### [201] [Data-Centric Elastic Pipeline Parallelism for Efficient Long-Context LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21275)
*Shiju Wang,Yujie Wang,Ao Sun,Fangcheng Fu,Zijian Zhu,Bin Cui,Xu Han,Kaisheng Ma*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues with pipeline parallelism (PP) in long-context training for large language models (LLMs) by proposing Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP), coupled with a system called InfiniPipe, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to long-context training for LLMs, such as sequence parallelism, face challenges like high communication overhead, while pipeline parallelism suffers from memory inefficiencies and hardware under-utilization depending on the granularity of partitioning. Efficient scheduling is further complicated by skewed sequence length distributions in real-world datasets.

Method: The paper introduces Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP), which dynamically switches between token-level and batch-level PP to match resource and workload characteristics. The system, InfiniPipe, incorporates a resource-aware sequence processor to balance workloads and a co-optimization methodology for pipeline scheduling and gradient checkpointing.

Result: InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup in distributed training compared to state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating significant efficiency advancement.

Conclusion: Elastic Pipeline Parallelism (EPP) and the InfiniPipe system provide a resource-optimized and workload-balanced solution for long-context distributed training, maximizing performance outcomes and addressing inefficiencies in static PP scheduling methods.

Abstract: Long context training is crucial for LLM's context extension. Existing
schemes, such as sequence parallelism, incur substantial communication
overhead. Pipeline parallelism (PP) reduces this cost, but its effectiveness
hinges on partitioning granularity. Batch-level PP dividing input samples
exhibits high memory consumption in long-context scenario, whereas token-level
PP splitting sequences into slices alleviates memory overhead but may incur
hardware under-utilization. This trade-off motivates adaptively selecting PP
granularity to match resource and workload characteristics. Moreover, sequence
length distribution of the real-world dataset exhibits skewness, posing a
challenge on PP's workload balance and efficient scheduling. Current static PP
scheduling methods overlook the variance of sequence length, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose Elastic Pipeline Parallelism
(EPP) that orchestrates token-level PP and batch-level PP to adapt to resource
and workload heterogeneity. We build InfiniPipe, a distributed training system
that unleashes the potential of EPP via (1) a resource-aware and
workload-balanced sequence processor that splits long sequences and packs short
ones; and (2) a co-optimization methodology that jointly optimizes pipeline
schedule and gradient checkpointing via a mechanism named stage-aware
chunk-level adaptive checkpointing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
InfiniPipe achieves a 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.

### [202] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model offers an efficient adaptive learned index that drastically reduces retraining costs and improves update handling using sigmoid functions, Gaussian mixture models, and neural optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned indexes face performance issues in dynamic datasets due to the high retraining costs required to maintain model accuracy, making them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates.

Method: The paper introduces Sig2Model, leveraging three techniques: sigmoid boosting for localized data distribution adjustments, proactive updates with Gaussian mixture models, and continuous refinement of parameters using neural joint optimization.

Result: Sig2Model demonstrates up to 20x reduced retraining costs, up to 3x higher query-per-second (QPS) rates, and memory usage reductions of up to 1000x compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Sig2Model method effectively addresses the challenges of learned indexes under dynamic updates, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

TL;DR: The paper formulates a framework called the Learning Lagrangian to develop efficient learning systems from first principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a foundational and efficient framework for learning processes that minimize the required observations to achieve a desired error threshold.

Method: Built upon least action principles from physics, the authors propose the Learning Lagrangian. They use this to derive established learning algorithms by searching for stationary paths in this formulation.

Result: The framework successfully derives classic machine learning algorithms, Bolman's optimality in reinforcement learning, and the Adam optimizer, providing evidence of its broad applicability.

Conclusion: The Learning Lagrangian offers a unified theory for interpreting and deriving efficient learning techniques grounded in physics-informed principles.

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient
learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that
reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations.
Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning
$\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths
in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

### [204] [A Theory of Multi-Agent Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20408)
*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow networks (MA-GFlowNets), proposing four algorithms to enable collaborative object generation across multiple agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend generative flow networks (GFNs), which are currently designed for single agents, to a multi-agent setting, enabling collaborative probabilistic object generation by multiple agents.

Method: The paper defines the theory behind MA-GFlowNets and introduces four algorithms: a centralized flow network, an independent flow network, a joint flow network, and an updated conditional joint flow network. The joint flow training principle utilizes a local-global approach for efficient training while ensuring theoretical guarantees for independent policy generation.

Result: The experimental results indicate that the proposed MA-GFlowNets framework outperforms existing reinforcement learning and MCMC-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed MA-GFlowNets framework and the associated algorithms effectively extend the utility of generative flow networks to multi-agent collaborative tasks, providing both theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Wenzhe Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle is a novel non-autoregressive drafter for speculative decoding, generating complete drafts in one pass, yielding faster generation speeds without compromising verification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speed up the speculative decoding process in large language models by removing the dependency on sequential steps in drafters like EAGLE.

Method: FastEagle employs a cascaded non-autoregressive drafting mechanism with layer-wise supervision and uses a constrained draft tree to enable lossless verification in one forward pass.

Result: FastEagle demonstrated significant speedups over state-of-the-art autoregressive drafters like EAGLE-3, while maintaining competitive output quality and acceptance behavior across various models and tasks.

Conclusion: Eliminating sequential dependencies in speculative decoding is a viable and practical technique to accelerate large language model inference without loss in performance.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces a machine learning-based ozone parameterization model (mloz) that offers rapid and accurate ozone predictions, enhancing climate model simulations' efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many climate models lack interactive ozone modeling due to high computational costs, yet ozone plays a vital role in solar radiation absorption, greenhouse effects, and atmospheric interactions.

Method: The mloz model uses machine learning to simulate daily ozone trends and variability, integrating ozone-temperature interactions. It is tested in two climate models (UKESM and ICON) with optimization for transferability and computational efficiency.

Result: The mloz model is 31 times faster than traditional chemistry schemes, maintaining high fidelity and contributing minimally to total runtime (less than 4%). It performs well across models, showcasing its adaptability and accuracy.

Conclusion: The mloz parameterization offers a scalable, computationally efficient solution for interactive ozone modeling, enabling its integration into broader climate models to improve future climate predictions.

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

*Kay Fuhrmeister,Arne Pelzer,Fabian Radke,Julia Lechinger,Mahzad Gharleghi,Thomas Köllmer,Insa Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a transformer-based autoencoder to anonymize EEG data, reducing subject re-identification risks while retaining its utility for tasks like sleep staging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns arising from the increasing availability of EEG devices, while ensuring that EEG data retains its utility for machine learning applications.

Method: A transformer-based autoencoder is proposed to anonymize EEG data by reducing its potential for subject re-identification while preserving its applicability for tasks such as sleep staging.

Result: The approach demonstrates a significant reduction in the re-identifiability of EEG signals, while the data maintains its utility in machine learning applications like automatic sleep staging.

Conclusion: It is possible to safeguard user privacy in EEG data by reducing re-identification risk, without sacrificing the data's utility for machine learning tasks, as validated through the proposed transformer-based autoencoder.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

### [208] [Efficiently Attacking Memorization Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20463)
*Tue Do,Varun Chandrasekaran,Daniel Alabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the vulnerability of memorization-based influence estimation tools to adversarial attacks and demonstrates the practicality of exploiting such weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether memorization-based influence estimation tools, a critical component in model understanding, data attribution, and dataset curation, can be manipulated adversarially given their increasing prominence in responsible machine learning and data valuation.

Method: The authors propose an attack that involves calculating the pseudoinverse of the input, which targets memorization-based influence estimators. The technique requires only black-box access to model outputs and has relatively low computational overhead. They validated this method empirically on various image classification tasks and performed a theoretical stability analysis of the estimators under adversarial perturbations.

Result: The attacks successfully manipulated even state-of-the-art memorization proxies, indicating vulnerability. Theoretical analysis further explained conditions under which these influence scores become unstable.

Conclusion: The research identifies significant vulnerabilities in memorization-based influence estimation tools, emphasizes the need for robust defenses, and provides code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

### [209] [Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478)
*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified approach for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning that combines contrastive representation learning with quasimetric distance parameterizations, improving performance in challenging environments and data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods often face limitations in either stitching capabilities or handling stochastic and suboptimal data. This paper aims to unify two effective representation frameworks to overcome these challenges.

Method: The approach integrates contrastive representations with quasimetric network parameterizations, leveraging the triangle inequality and additional constraints to learn successor representations for optimal goal-reaching in various environments.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on offline benchmarks, resolving stitching tasks where contrastive methods struggle and noisy, high-dimensional tasks where quasimetric techniques falter.

Conclusion: By combining the advantages of contrastive RL methods and quasimetric network parameterizations, the approach enables stable, long-horizon goal-reaching capabilities and improved performance in complex settings.

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

*D. Darankoum,C. Habermacher,J. Volle,S. Grudinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep-learning framework for analyzing EEG signals that optimally extracts features, handles noise, and models complex dependencies, validated in CNS disorder diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG signals are rich in multiscale information but pose challenges such as noise, channel variability, and complex temporal dependencies. Effective feature extraction is crucial for applications in brain state understanding and CNS disorder diagnostics.

Method: The proposed method involves a novel encoder for multiscale frequency extraction, an attention-based module to model channel and temporal dependencies, and a gating network for noise filtering. A unique loss function combining supervised and contrastive learning optimizes generalization.

Result: The framework enables robust feature extraction, channel selection, and generalization, validated across applications like CNS disorder effects classification and diagnosis of diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

Conclusion: The deep-learning framework effectively captures informative EEG patterns, autonomously selects key channels, and generalizes across tasks, offering a reliable tool for brain state analysis and neural disorder diagnostics.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTVAE enhances clustering by embedding domain-specific rules and multimodal data directly into a unified space, outperforming traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods overlook critical structural and semantic constraints needed in many domains, relying solely on input data similarity.

Method: The proposed DARTVAE integrates explicit rules generated by LLMs and structured into knowledge graphs, within a VAE architecture that penalizes rule violations.

Result: Experiments on datasets like automotive and aircraft demonstrated more meaningful and interpretable clusters compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Rule-guided multimodal clustering improves representation learning outcomes but faces challenges such as rule hallucination, overfitting, and scalability issues in complex domains.

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

*Evgenii Egorov,Hanno Ackermann,Markus Nagel,Hong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel algorithm that efficiently combines sparsity and recurrent dependence for attention layers, optimizing their performance for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the quadratic scaling issue of memory and compute in attention layers, especially for long sequence processing, by overcoming limitations of existing approaches like sparsity and recurrent dependence.

Method: The paper proposes a new algorithm leveraging efficient inversion of tree-structured matrices to merge the benefits of sparsity and recurrent dependence in attention mechanisms.

Result: The algorithm successfully balances sparsity and recurrence, offering computational and memory efficiency for sequence-to-sequence attention operations.

Conclusion: The proposed method is an effective solution to optimize attention layers when processing long sequences, combining the strengths of previous techniques while mitigating their drawbacks.

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to streamline the computational process for evaluating full-field damage in concrete, which traditionally requires heavy computational resources, and to enhance our understanding of aggregate properties' influence on concrete performance.

Method: The paper uses a dual-network architecture comprising an auto-regressive U-Net model for sequential predictions of damage progression and a CNN for forecasting mechanical properties based on damage estimations.

Result: The dual-network architecture showed high computational efficiency and robust performance on synthesised datasets, effectively linking aggregate properties to shrinkage and stiffness reduction.

full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

*Tanzila Tabassum,Omer Subasi,Ajay Panyala,Epiya Ebiapia,Gerald Baumgartner,Erdal Mutlu,P.,Sadayappan,Karol Kowalski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops machine learning methods to predict computational costs for parallel chemistry applications, optimizing runtime parameters on supercomputers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist users of supercomputers in selecting optimal configurations for chemistry computations without costly trial runs.

Method: Machine learning (Gradient Boosting and Active Learning) models predict execution times based on collected data from supercomputers.

Result: Gradient Boosting predicts execution times with less than 7.3% error, and active learning achieves 20% error with fewer experiments.

Conclusion: ML-based strategies can guide users to cost-effective and efficient configurations for complex chemistry computations on supercomputers.

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes replacing entropy maximization in policy gradient methods with a complexity-driven approach to encourage structured and adaptable exploration strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient methods often rely on entropy maximization, which leads to unstructured exploration. The authors aim to develop a more efficient exploration mechanism to improve learning performance.

Method: The paper introduces a complexity measure combining Shannon entropy and disequilibrium that balances high stochasticity with structured exploration. This is implemented as a regularizer in the Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO) algorithm, replacing the entropy bonus in Proximal Policy Optimization.

Result: Empirical comparisons across various discrete action tasks indicate CDPO's superior robustness to coefficient choices and better exploration capability in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The adoption of complexity-based regularization encourages useful, non-trivial behaviors and demonstrates improved learning efficiency in exploration-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

### [216] [A Recovery Theory for Diffusion Priors: Deterministic Analysis of the Implicit Prior Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20511)
*Oscar Leong,Yann Traonmilin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper establishes a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms in solving inverse problems that utilize generative diffusion models as priors, providing rigorous guarantees of convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of rigorous recovery guarantees in the application of generative diffusion models, which have shown empirical success in solving inverse problems.

Method: The authors analyze deterministic diffusion-based algorithms by interpreting noise-convolved scores as projections onto low-dimensional model sets and setting the problem within a generalized projected gradient descent framework. They also derive quantitative convergence rates for algorithms under certain conditions.

Result: The paper provides theoretical insights, demonstrating that the algorithms achieve recovery with rigorous convergence guarantees under restricted isometry conditions on the sensing matrix. They validate this in examples involving compact convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models.

Conclusion: The study advances theoretical understanding of deterministic diffusion-based methods, offering explicit guarantees for recovery in inverse problems, even in settings with nonconvex model structures.

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

### [217] [The Sensitivity of Variational Bayesian Neural Network Performance to Hyperparameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20574)
*Scott Koermer,Natalie Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies the effects of hyperparameter selection on Bayesian Neural Networks' (BNNs) predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ), using global sensitivity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in scientific predictive modeling to identify model extrapolations or guide further data collection. BNNs offer potential but are challenged by hyperparameter choices and training approximations.

Method: The authors perform a global sensitivity analysis on the hyperparameters of Bayesian Neural Networks to examine how these affect predictive accuracy and UQ.

Result: The study shows that hyperparameters interact to significantly affect both predictive accuracy and UQ. It emphasizes the necessity of dimensionality reduction and proper hyperparameter selection.

Conclusion: Global sensitivity analysis or Bayesian optimization can help select appropriate hyperparameters for BNNs to enhance predictive accuracy and UQ in real-world applications.

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

*Amirmohammad Ziaei Bideh,Aleksandra Georgievska,Jonathan Gryak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDBench, a benchmarking framework for evaluating the accuracy and robustness of 12 model discovery algorithms across various dynamical systems, including ODEs and PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models limits the understanding of progress and trade-offs in model discovery methods.

Method: They developed MDBench to benchmark 12 algorithms on 63 ODEs and 14 PDEs under varied noise conditions, using metrics such as derivative prediction accuracy and model complexity.

Result: Linear methods excelled in robustness to noise and low prediction errors for PDEs, while genetic programming was most effective for ODEs.

Conclusion: MDBench serves as a rigorous and extensible framework that facilitates systematic comparisons and enhancements in model discovery methods, addressing key limitations in the field.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

*Nikolay Blagoev,Bart Cox,Jérémie Decouchant,Lydia Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GWTF, a novel decentralized framework for training large language models efficiently across heterogeneous client nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to democratize the training of large language models by addressing challenges in decentralized and heterogeneous environments.

Method: GWTF uses a decentralized flow algorithm to optimize microbatch routing, ensuring crash tolerance and adaptability to dynamic client participation and network stability.

Result: The evaluations demonstrate up to 45% reduction in training time on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models under challenging and realistic decentralized conditions.

Conclusion: GWTF proves effective for decentralized, resource-heterogeneous training, making LLM training more accessible and resilient in diverse environments.

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

### [220] [Understanding and Improving Adversarial Robustness of Neural Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20549)
*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Robust Neural Probabilistic Circuits (RNPC), a model combining a bottleneck attribute recognition module and probabilistic reasoning to improve adversarial robustness and maintain interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the adversarial vulnerability in Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), where input perturbations can compromise predictions by targeting the black box nature of the attribute recognition module.

Method: The authors propose RNPC, which integrates a novel class-wise inference mechanism to ensure robust combination of outputs from the attribute recognition module and probabilistic circuit. The adversarial robustness of RNPC is theoretically and empirically analyzed.

Result: The paper shows that RNPC provides enhanced adversarial robustness compared to NPCs and other concept bottleneck models. RNPC also retains high accuracy in benign scenarios.

Conclusion: RNPC is a provably robust solution over NPCs for adversarial attack scenarios, combining interpretability with performance and outperforming existing models in robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SuperOffload, a system for optimizing LLM training on Superchips, which combines GPUs and CPUs in a tightly coupled architecture, showing a 2.5x throughput improvement over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of research on how large language model (LLM) training can benefit from the novel architecture of Superchips, which integrate GPUs and CPUs more efficiently.

Method: The authors propose SuperOffload, a system optimized for Superchips through techniques like adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and an optimized Adam optimizer.

Result: Empirical evaluations on NVIDIA GH200 show that SuperOffload achieves up to 2.5x throughput improvement, supports up to 25B model training on a single Superchip, and achieves efficient sequence parallelism for models with 1 million tokens.

Conclusion: SuperOffload effectively leverages the unique architecture of Superchips, achieving significant improvements in LLM training throughput and scalability, and demonstrating its potential for future AI hardware advancements.

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

*Annabel Ma,Kaiying Hou,David Alvarez-Melis,Melanie Weber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bispectral Optimal Transport (BOT), an extension of discrete optimal transport (OT) making it symmetry-aware for improved dataset alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of traditional OT alignments, which fail to account for intrinsic data coherence in symmetry-rich settings.

Method: This approach extends OT by using the bispectrum, a symmetry-preserving group Fourier invariant, to compare data elements and filter out variations caused by group actions.

Result: Empirical results show that Bispectral OT outperforms naive feature-based OT in preserving class structure, particularly on benchmark datasets with visual symmetries.

Conclusion: Bispectral OT enhances OT's capacity to generate meaningful alignments, preserving semantic label structure and discarding irrelevant variation due to symmetry.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

*Athar Parvez,Muhammad Jawad Mufti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper compares two hybrid machine learning classifiers for diabetes risk stratification and evaluates their generalizability on external data, finding that the XGBoost-Random Forest (XGB-RF) model consistently outperforms the Support Vector Machine-Logistic Regression (SVM-LR) model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance early diabetes risk stratification, which is critical due to the rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide, by employing and evaluating machine learning models.

Method: The study involved building two hybrid classifiers (XGB-RF and SVM-LR), implementing a leakage-safe pipeline, and evaluating the models using metrics like AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier calibration. External validation was conducted using the PIMA cohort.

Result: The XGB-RF model demonstrated superior performance in both internal and external cohorts across multiple metrics such as AUROC (~0.995 internally, ~0.990 externally) and AUPRC. It also maintained better threshold-based performance in the external cohort compared to SVM-LR.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the robustness and transferability of gradient-boosting-based hybrid models for diabetes risk stratification, advocating for further validation in multi-site settings with clinically informed thresholding.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

*Yuda Bi,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a formal mathematical explanation of scaling laws in deep learning as redundancy laws, showing their dependence on data redundancy and spectral tail characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the elusive mathematical origins of scaling laws in deep learning, specifically explaining their scaling exponent.

Method: Using kernel regression, polynomial data covariance spectrum analysis, and testing across various architectures and regimes, the paper derives scaling laws mathematically.

Result: The study finds that scaling laws arise from data covariance spectra with polynomial tails, linking the learning curve slope to data redundancy and spectral steepness.

Conclusion: Scaling laws are rigorously explained as redundancy laws, offering a unified theoretical framework across different models and architectures in deep learning.

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

*Mingze Yuan,Pengfei Jin,Na Li,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models, while strong in generative tasks, often violate physical laws. To address this, the paper proposes Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF), which replaces the common DPS approach with a reward-based framework for better adherence to physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the physical accuracy of outputs generated by diffusion models, addressing challenges like constraint violations, training instability, and inefficiency in inference.

Method: The proposed method, PIRF, calculates trajectory-based rewards and directly backpropagates gradients, utilizing strategies like layer-wise truncated backpropagation and weight-based regularization to improve efficiency and fidelity.

Result: PIRF consistently outperforms existing physics-informed generative modeling methods across five PDE benchmarks, ensuring better adherence to physical constraints under efficient sampling conditions.

Conclusion: Reward fine-tuning, as implemented in PIRF, shows promise in advancing the scientific applicability of generative models while addressing key efficiency and fidelity challenges.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

### [226] [Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20993)
*Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of estimating the inverse temperature parameter (β) of a truncated Ising model from a single sample, using an optimized estimator with improved consistency for specific graph structures and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating the β parameter of a truncated Ising model is essential for understanding complex probabilistic distributions affected by truncations such as logical constraints (e.g., k-SAT formulas). This estimation process is computationally challenging due to the model's restrictions and the single sample input.

Method: The paper develops an estimator using pseudolikelihood maximization, leveraging recent analytical techniques from probabilistic and truncated models while improving them to account for the specific conditions of the truncated Ising model with bounded graph degree and k-SAT truncation constraints.

Result: The estimator reliably estimates β in nearly O(n) time with consistency bound of O(Δ³/√n) for bounded degree graphs and satisfies specific k-SAT constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively extends prior approaches by handling the complexities of truncated Ising models, offering a computationally efficient and statistically consistent solution for parameter estimation constrained by logical satisfiability conditions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

### [227] [Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21021)
*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called E-CIT to make conditional independence tests (CITs) more computationally efficient for causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive computational cost of traditional conditional independence tests used in causal discovery, especially with large sample sizes and complex datasets.

Method: E-CIT uses a divide-and-aggregate approach, dividing data into subsets, performing CITs on each subset, and aggregating p-values through a new method based on stable distributions.

Result: E-CIT reduces the computational time to linear complexity under fixed subset size while maintaining theoretical consistency. Experiments show it reduces computational load and performs competitively, especially on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: E-CIT is an effective and efficient framework for performing CITs, making causal discovery more computationally feasible while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

### [228] [Learning Greens Operators through Hierarchical Neural Networks Inspired by the Fast Multipole Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20591)
*Emilio McAllister Fognini,Marta M. Betcke,Ben T. Cox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper integrates the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) with a novel neural network architecture called Neural FMM for efficient learning of the Green's operator of Elliptic PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the uncharted integration of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) with modern machine learning architectures, addressing the gap in efficiently learning complex interactions and representations.

Method: The authors propose the Neural FMM, a hierarchical machine learning framework that adopts the FMM computation flow to separate local and far-field interactions while learning their distinct representations.

Result: Neural FMM efficiently combines the principles of FMM with machine learning techniques, offering a more structured and computationally effective approach to learning Elliptic PDE solutions.

Conclusion: Integrating FMM into machine learning architectures provides an innovative path for handling complex systems like Elliptic PDEs, enhancing computational efficiency and representation learning.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

### [229] [Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21172)
*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper revisits softmax inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and proposes a simpler approach based on supervised learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in traditional IRL methods, such as complex optimization and dynamic programming, which hinder the use of advanced function approximation tools.

Method: The paper reformulates IRL as two supervised learning tasks: estimating the behavior policy through classification and solving a linear fixed-point equation via iterative regression.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive or superior empirical performance compared to traditional MaxEnt IRL approaches.

Conclusion: By simplifying the IRL process, this framework allows broader adoption of modern function approximators and improves efficiency and modularity in IRL applications.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

*Kamal Singh,Priyanka Rawat,Sami Marouani,Baptiste Jeudy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling in video streaming, leveraging interpretable machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video streaming services need advanced QoE models to better understand and optimize user experience.

Method: The method employs Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for interpretability, combined with frequency-domain analyses on time series data.

Result: Experiments show enhanced prediction accuracy and transparency when tested on popular datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves better accuracy in QoE predictions while maintaining interpretability in video streaming applications.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) modeling is crucial for optimizing video
streaming services to capture the complex relationships between different
features and user experience. We propose a novel approach to QoE modeling in
video streaming applications using interpretable Machine Learning (ML)
techniques over raw time series data. Unlike traditional black-box approaches,
our method combines Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an interpretable
readout on top of compact frequency-domain features, allowing us to capture
temporal information while retaining a transparent and explainable model. We
evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

### [231] [Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181)
*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper characterizes the scaling behavior of parameter norms under overparameterized linear regression with a minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator, revealing transitions and thresholds in norm behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unresolved question of scaling behavior in overparameterized models motivated the study, as understanding this phenomenon is vital for insights into implicit or explicit biases in machine learning.

Method: The authors used a dual-ray analysis to study the behavior of parameter norms, deriving closed-form predictions to characterize transitions and thresholds in their scaling.

Result: The analysis revealed data-dependent transitions and universal thresholds separating norms that plateau from those that grow, offering a unified view linking explicit $\ell_p$ interpolators to implicit bias in diagonal linear networks.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that the scaling behavior of parameter norms depends sensitively on the specific $\ell_r$ norm used, impacting generalization proxies and predictive modeling insights.

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

### [232] [Explicit and Effectively Symmetric Schemes for Neural SDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20599)
*Daniil Shmelev,Cristopher Salvi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of Runge-Kutta schemes for neural SDEs, addressing memory and stability challenges in backpropagation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation through neural SDEs poses issues with memory overhead and stability, necessitating more efficient solutions.

Method: The authors develop Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) Runge-Kutta schemes for neural SDEs to combine memory efficiency, stability, and accuracy.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed schemes are both stable and reliable, outperforming existing approaches for neural SDE training.

Conclusion: The proposed schemes provide a scalable and accurate foundation for training neural SDEs, addressing critical limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

### [233] [No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21296)
*Yehonatan Refael,Guy Smorodinsky,Ofir Lindenbaum,Itay Safran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the reliability and limitations of reconstructing training data from neural network parameters and challenges the notion that stronger implicit biases universally compromise privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network memorization raises privacy and security concerns, as training set data can sometimes be reconstructed from model parameters, potentially undermining trust in machine learning systems.

Method: The authors identify and analyze weaknesses in existing reconstruction methods, providing theoretical proofs and empirical evidence that training data reconstructions can frequently fail or deviate arbitrarily from true data.

Result: They prove that in the absence of prior knowledge about data, exact training data reconstructions are unreliable and often occur only by chance. Additionally, they demonstrate that networks with stronger implicit bias are less prone to reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding of training data leakage and shows that stronger generalization in deep networks does not necessarily compromise privacy, providing insights for mitigating reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

*Su Ann Low,Quentin Rommel,Kevin S. Miller,Adam J. Thorpe,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces function encoders to connect neural network-based feature learning with kernel methods, enabling scalable and adaptive representations of function spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge neural models and kernel methods, addressing scalability and accuracy in adaptable function representations.

Method: Two training methods are developed: Progressive Training for basis expansion and Train-then-Prune for computational efficiency, both incorporating PCA principles.

Result: Experiments show efficiency and compactness by achieving similar accuracies with fewer basis functions on polynomial benchmarks and dynamical systems.

Conclusion: Function encoders provide scalable, adaptable, and principled neural models with inference guarantees and compact representations.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

### [235] [MMG: Mutual Information Estimation via the MMSE Gap in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20609)
*Longxuan Yu,Xing Shi,Xianghao Kong,Tong Jia,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for estimating mutual information (MI) using diffusion models, leveraging their information-theoretic formulation to achieve accurate and scalable estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating mutual information (MI) in complex systems is a challenging task, and traditional methods have limitations. The paper explores whether denoising diffusion models, which have shown strong density estimation capabilities, could improve MI estimation.

Method: The authors relate MI to the gap in Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion in denoising diffusion models, integrating this across Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). They also use adaptive importance sampling to scale the method.

Result: The proposed approach passes self-consistency tests and outperforms existing traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. It is particularly effective even when MI values are high.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide a practical and scalable solution for MI estimation, delivering improved accuracy and adaptability over previous methodologies.

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

*Daehee Lee,Dongsu Lee,TaeYoon Kwack,Wonje Choi,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SIL-C, a framework aimed at bridging the gap between an evolving skill repertoire and downstream policies in Skill Incremental Learning (SIL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge that arises when an agent's skill set evolves, creating compatibility issues with existing skill-based policies, thus limiting their reusability and generalization.

Method: The method involves a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping to dynamically align the subtask space (referenced by policies) with the skill space (decoded into behaviors), enabling efficient subtask execution based on trajectory similarity.

Result: SIL-C was evaluated in diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrated its ability to maintain compatibility between evolving skills and policies while ensuring learning efficiency.

Conclusion: SIL-C resolves skill-policy compatibility issues effectively, allowing skill improvements to enhance downstream policy performance without necessitating policy retraining.

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

*Matthias Chung,Deepanshu Verma,Max Collins,Amit N. Subrahmanya,Varuni Katti Sastry,Vishwas Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Latent Twins," a unified mathematical framework designed to model and predict complex systems in latent space, effectively integrating scientific modeling and data-driven techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate representation learning and algorithmic solution methods into a single, cohesive pipeline for analyzing and predicting complex systems.

Method: The "Latent Twins" framework mirrors mathematical systems in a latent space governed by operators, allowing classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation to be unified under a single principle.

Result: The framework demonstrates capabilities across canonical ODEs, a PDE benchmark using shallow-water equations, and a geopotential reanalysis dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Latent Twins offer a scalable, interpretable surrogate for solution operators, enabling compatibility with existing scientific pipelines and bridging classical scientific modeling with data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

*Hanjiang Hu,Changliu Liu,Na Li,Yebin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an innovative method (Group Relative Policy Optimization) to make complex, multi-turn planning problems more efficient, achieving high success rates and generalizable capabilities using a smaller model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLM agents for multi-turn task planning is challenging due to issues like sparse rewards and high computational requirements.

Method: The authors reformulate multi-turn tasks into single-turn reasoning problems and use GRPO to optimize them with expert-derived rewards.

Result: A 1.5B parameter model trained with GRPO demonstrated superior performance (70% success rate) compared to larger 14B models on complex tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed GRPO method provides effective and scalable solutions for multi-turn task planning, with theoretical and empirical validation of strong cross-task generalizability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

### [239] [Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning for Modeling Heterogeneity in Multi-site fMRI Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20627)
*Yipu Zhang,Chengshuo Zhang,Ziyu Zhou,Gang Qu,Hao Zheng,Yuping Wang,Hui Shen,Hongwen Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a framework designed for multi-site fMRI studies under data privacy constraints, which outperforms other methods in handling non-IID data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy constraints and site-specific heterogeneity in multi-site fMRI studies make it challenging to build generalizable models across non-IID data.

Method: PFedDL uses independent dictionary learning at each site by decomposing dictionaries into shared global components and personalized local components. Federated aggregation updates global atoms for consistency, while local atoms capture variability.

Result: Experiments on the ABIDE dataset show that PFedDL achieves higher accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods for non-IID datasets.

Conclusion: PFedDL provides an effective method for collaborative modeling across sites, enabling better outcomes in multi-site fMRI studies while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

### [240] [Investigating Modality Contribution in Audio LLMs for Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20641)
*Giovana Morais,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines whether Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) truly analyze audio or primarily rely on textual reasoning. Using MM-SHAP based on Shapley values, it quantifies modality contributions, discovering models rely more on text but can localize audio events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It is unclear if Audio LLMs genuinely utilize audio input or depend heavily on text for predictions, despite benchmarks claiming human-like music conversation capabilities.

Method: The MM-SHAP framework is employed, applying Shapley values to assess how much audio and text individually contribute to predictions by Audio LLMs.

Result: A more accurate model relies heavily on text for decision-making, while still being capable of identifying significant sound events despite low overall audio contributions.

Conclusion: This work, the first to apply MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs, lays a foundation for enhancing explainability in AI, emphasizing the nuanced roles of audio and text in predictions.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

### [241] [Wonder Wins Ways: Curiosity-Driven Exploration through Multi-Agent Contextual Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20648)
*Yiyuan Pan,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CERMIC, a framework to enhance exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning by dynamically calibrating intrinsic curiosity and filtering noisy rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning, where existing curiosity mechanisms fail to differentiate meaningful novelty from environmental stochasticity, and underutilize the novelty of peer behavior.

Method: The proposed framework, CERMIC, calibrates agent curiosity dynamically based on multi-agent context, filters noisy surprise signals, and provides intrinsic rewards grounded in information theory.

Result: CERMIC showed superior exploration performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward environments using benchmarks like VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2.

Conclusion: CERMIC offers a more effective exploration strategy in decentralized, communication-free settings, improving the task dynamics understanding and reinforcing its applicability to sparse-reward MARL challenges.

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

*Tongxi Wang,Zhuoyang Xia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reliability of in-context learning (ICL) with varying prompt lengths, providing theoretical bounds and a practical estimation method to enhance stability and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how prompt length affects the stability and reliability of in-context learning (ICL) under high-dimensional data scenarios, seeking to bridge theory and practice.

Method: Develop a theoretical lower bound with spectral properties linking minimal demonstrations to ICL stability, and introduce a two-stage observable estimator for prompt-length calibration without prior distributions.

Result: Empirical results exhibit alignment between predicted and actual thresholds for prompt length, demonstrating reliability, with calibration further refining this relationship.

Conclusion: The study links spectral properties to ICL stability, enhances its reliability, and offers interpretable, practitioner-friendly tools for real-world applications.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative LLM fine-tuning without data sharing, but this paper shows that FL does not fully mitigate data leakage risks. Enhanced attack strategies still enable privacy compromise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore privacy risks in collaboratively fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using federated learning (FL), which is often used as a privacy-preserving alternative to sharing local data.

Method: The study conducted extensive experiments to assess data leakage from a global model trained through FL. It introduced new attack strategies that track global model updates during training to enhance privacy breaching.

Result: The findings revealed that attackers could extract training data from the global model, with leakage increasing for larger models. The newly proposed attack methods further exploited privacy vulnerabilities in FL setups.

Conclusion: Existing FL mechanisms do not fully protect against data leakage when fine-tuning LLMs. Adopting privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy and safety-aligned LLMs, can help mitigate these risks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

*Mohammadsaleh Refahi,Bahrad A. Sokhansanj,James R. Brown,Gail Rosen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FIRM-DTI, a framework for drug-target affinity prediction using feature-wise linear modulation and metric learning, which shows state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve drug-target affinity prediction by addressing poor generalization in current models that rely on simple representation fusion.

Method: FIRM-DTI uses a feature-wise linear modulation layer to condition molecular embeddings on protein embeddings, enforces metric structure with triplet loss, and applies an RBF regression head for affinity prediction.

Result: FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Conditioning and metric learning significantly enhance drug-target affinity prediction, providing a robust and interpretable modeling approach.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

### [245] [CE-GPPO: Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712)
*Zhenpeng Su,Leiyu Pan,Minxuan Lv,Yuntao Li,Wenping Hu,Fuzheng Zhang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of policy entropy management in reinforcement learning for language models, proposing a novel algorithm (CE-GPPO) to utilize clipped gradient signals for better entropy regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods like PPO lose valuable gradient signals due to their clipping mechanisms, which challenges maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Method: The CE-GPPO algorithm reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in a bounded way, allowing better control over entropy dynamics and improved optimization.

Result: CE-GPPO demonstrates superior performance in managing entropy dynamics compared to strong baselines, validated through experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks across various model scales.

Conclusion: The CE-GPPO algorithm effectively resolves entropy instability issues and achieves improved optimization and reasoning capability in language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

*Alston Lo,Connor W. Coley,Wojciech Matusik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynGA is a genetic algorithm designed for synthesizable molecular design, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like analog search and property optimization through customizable operators and machine learning-enhanced filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of genetic algorithms and the necessity for synthesizability in molecular design, addressing challenges in efficient property optimization and analog search.

Method: A custom genetic algorithm (SynGA) with tailored crossover/mutation operators constrained to synthesizable molecular space, enhanced with machine learning-based filtering and Bayesian optimization.

Result: SynGA demonstrated effectiveness in diverse design tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in property optimization when integrated with machine learning filters.

Conclusion: SynGA is both a strong standalone tool and a flexible module for synthesis-aware workflows, offering promise for future applications in molecular design and optimization.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

### [247] [The Impact of Audio Watermarking on Audio Anti-Spoofing Countermeasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20736)
*Zhenshan Zhang,Xueping Zhang,Yechen Wang,Liwei Jin,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effect of audio watermarking on spoofing countermeasures and introduces a benchmark dataset with mitigation strategies to enhance watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the unexplored impact of audio watermarking—designed for copyright protection—on speech anti-spoofing systems, which are critical for speech security.

Method: The authors created the Watermark-Spoofing dataset by applying various watermarking methods to anti-spoofing datasets and introduced Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) to adapt models to watermark-induced shifts.

Result: Experiments revealed that audio watermarking degrades anti-spoofing performance, with denser watermarks increasing Equal Error Rates. The proposed KPWL framework mitigates these effects, preserving spoofing detection capability.

Conclusion: Audio watermarking introduces a domain shift that impacts anti-spoofing systems, and the paper provides the first benchmark for addressing this limitation with mitigation strategies like the KPWL framework.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

### [248] [Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20768)
*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper assesses how varying Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) hyperparameters impacts synthetic data quality and runtime, using the GReaT and REaLTabFormer tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based TDS models are effective for generating high-quality synthetic data but suffer from high computational costs, requiring a detailed analysis of their efficiency and usability.

Method: The study evaluates the sensitivity of 10 model setups across runtime, machine learning utility, and data similarity using four real-world datasets and the TDS tools GReaT and REaLTabFormer.

Result: The runtime increases with hyperparameter complexity, with GReaT being faster than REaLTabFormer for small datasets. However, REaLTabFormer maintains better utility and similarity for larger datasets, though its runtime remains high.

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance of data quality and computational performance, but its runtime indicates room for efficiency improvement.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

### [249] [IConv: Focusing on Local Variation with Channel Independent Convolution for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20783)
*Gawon Lee,Hanbyeol Park,Minseop Kim,Dohee Kim,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid model combining multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address non-stationary time-series data. The approach effectively captures both global trends and local variations, leading to improved forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity with trends, seasonality, and residuals. While MLP models address long-term dependencies, their linear structure struggles with local variations. CNNs excel in capturing such fine-grained patterns, motivating the need for a hybrid solution.

Method: The proposed method combines MLPs for modeling long-term trends and CNNs for modeling local patterns using diverse kernels. It introduces a novel architecture, IConv, which handles temporal dependencies independently for each channel and inter-channel relationships through separate layers.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model outperforms other approaches in multivariate time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: The integration of MLP and CNN, along with the introduction of IConv architecture, effectively addresses non-stationary time-series data challenges and enhances forecasting performance.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

*Abhishek Moturu,Anna Goldenberg,Babak Taati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study presents LiLAW, an effective method to address noisy labels and data heterogeneity by dynamically adjusting sample loss weights based on difficulty levels during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in training deep neural networks arise from the presence of noisy labels and heterogeneous datasets, which impact model performance and robustness.

Method: LiLAW employs three learnable parameters that adjust loss weights dynamically for easy, moderate, or hard samples using mini-batch gradient descent on the validation set after each training batch.

Result: LiLAW improves performance consistently across diverse datasets, noise conditions, architectures, and loss functions without heavy dependence on data augmentation or regularization.

Conclusion: This lightweight, computationally efficient approach enhances model robustness and generalization, offering practical applicability across neural network setups.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses data efficiency in sequence models by aligning model inductive bias with task characteristics using Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI), improving low-data regime performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale models rely on scaling laws but encounter challenges due to finite high-quality data. Improving data efficiency by optimizing inductive bias is critical for scaling and generalization.

Method: The authors formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs using an SSM-induced kernel and propose the Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI) method, which performs power spectrum matching to align bias with the task's spectral needs.

Result: TDI significantly enhances data efficiency and generalization, especially in low-data scenarios, as demonstrated via experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical and practical framework to create more data-efficient models, marking progress toward sustainable scaling in model development.

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FERD improves fairness and robustness in data-free robustness distillation by generating balanced adversarial examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook robust fairness issues, leading to disparities in robustness across categories.

Method: FERD introduces class reweighting and uniformity constraints to generate balanced and fairness-aware adversarial examples.

Result: FERD achieves superior worst-class robustness improvements across attacks in benchmarks like CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FERD addresses robustness disparities and achieves state-of-the-art fairness and robustness in data-free robustness distillation.

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces T2I-Diff, an innovative method for generating realistic fMRI data using time-frequency representations and a novel diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in fMRI data synthesis, including the inability of existing models to handle complex dynamics in blood oxygenation signals.

Method: T2I-Diff converts BOLD signals into spectrograms using Fourier transforms, generates class-specific spectrograms via a classifier-free diffusion model, then reverts spectrograms to signals using inverse transforms.

Result: Enhanced performance in downstream tasks, such as brain network classification, demonstrating the validity and utility of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: T2I-Diff advances fMRI synthesis methods and offers a more accurate and generalizable approach to brain analysis tasks.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for context-aware time series captioning, involving real data and detailed captioning tasks verified through rigorous checks and validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for time series captioning are often too simplistic, rely on synthetic data, and overlook essential aspects such as metadata and visual representation. This paper aims to address these limitations by creating a comprehensive, context-aware benchmark.

Method: The authors developed CaTS-Bench using 11 diverse datasets and a scalable pipeline to produce context-aware captions. Most captions are generated by an LLM and validated through checks like human indistinguishability and diversity analysis. Human-revisited test captions further ensure accuracy. The benchmark also includes multiple-choice questions and proposes new evaluation metrics.

Result: CaTS-Bench comprises approximately 465k training and 105k test timestamps, with a subset of human-revisited captions for enhanced quality. It provides a robust platform for evaluating time series captioning and reasoning capabilities in models.

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench establishes a strong foundation for future work in time series analysis and the development of foundation models by addressing limitations in prior benchmarks and introducing robust evaluation practices.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

*Keitaro Sakamoto,Issei Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores late-phase training phenomena like grokking and the information bottleneck principle by linking them to neural collapse and examining the dynamics of learned representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the poorly-explained late-phase phenomena in deep learning training dynamics, such as grokking and the information bottleneck principle.

Method: The authors investigate neural collapse during training by analyzing within-class variance contraction and its connection to data dynamics. They validated their findings experimentally on various datasets and architectures.

Result: A unified explanation for grokking and the information bottleneck was achieved, linking these phenomena to the timing and progression of neural collapse.

Conclusion: Late-phase phenomena in deep learning can be effectively explained by analyzing within-class variance and neural collapse dynamics, providing insights into their timing and mechanisms.

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

*Jiaqi Tang,Yinsong Xu,Yang Liu,Qingchao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-stage training framework for multi-modal fusion to avoid modality competition, emphasizing shaping the initial state through unimodal training before joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of modality competition in multi-modal fusion where one modality dominates, leaving others under-optimized, and to emphasize the importance of shaping the initial state for better learning.

Method: The method proposes a novel metric (Effective Competitive Strength) and a two-component framework: a diagnostic metric based on mutual information and a computationally efficient solver, FastPID, combined with an asynchronous training controller for balancing modalities.

Result: The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, validating the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state effectively mitigates modality competition and unlocks synergistic multi-modal fusion, providing a reliable foundation for improved performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-omics data provide valuable insights into diseases but are often hindered by missing modalities which challenge integrative analyses.

Method: MOIRA uses a shared embedding space and a learnable weighting mechanism to integrate incomplete multi-omics data by representation alignment and adaptive aggregation.

Result: MOIRA outperformed existing methods on Alzheimer's Disease datasets and identified relevant biomarkers consistent with existing literature.

Conclusion: MOIRA is effective in handling incomplete multi-omics data and provides biologically meaningful insights for disease research.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

### [258] [Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20846)
*Yutong Xia,Chang Xu,Yuxuan Liang,Qingsong Wen,Roger Zimmermann,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel causal time series generation (TSG) framework called CaTSG, which supports observational, interventional, and counterfactual settings by leveraging a diffusion-based approach with backdoor-adjusted guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TSG methods focus only on observational correlations and fail to consider unobserved confounding effects, limiting their application for more complex simulation scenarios like interventions and counterfactuals.

Method: The proposed CaTSG uses a diffusion-based framework incorporating backdoor-adjusted guidance and derives causal score functions through the abduction-action-prediction procedure to handle observational, interventional, and counterfactual data generation tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CaTSG achieves high fidelity while uniquely supporting both interventional and counterfactual generation, which existing methods cannot handle.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the causal TSG task family and validates it with the CaTSG model, demonstrating its potential for reliable simulation tasks under various causal scenarios and highlighting a significant advancement in the field of time series generation.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

### [259] [FHRFormer: A Self-supervised Transformer Approach for Fetal Heart Rate Inpainting and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20852)
*Kjersti Engan,Neel Kanwal,Anita Yeconia,Ladislaus Blacy,Yuda Munyaw,Estomih Mduma,Hege Ersdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of missing data in fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring due to factors like sensor displacement. They propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder for robust reconstruction of missing FHR signals, suitable for signal inpainting, forecasting, and developing AI risk algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 10% of newborns require breathing assistance at birth, and continuous FHR monitoring is critical for timely obstetric interventions. Missing FHR data due to maternal movement or sensor issues limit the utility of AI in analyzing datasets and predicting risks.

Method: A masked transformer-based autoencoder is proposed to reconstruct missing FHR signals. The method captures both spatial and frequency components of the data, demonstrating robustness across varied durations of missing data.

Result: The proposed method effectively reconstructs missing FHR signals and shows potential for applications in signal inpainting, forecasting, and enabling the development of AI-based risk prediction algorithms.

Conclusion: The method is a promising step toward integrating AI for better risk detection in fetal monitoring. It could potentially enhance wearable FHR devices and support earlier, robust risk predictions in clinical and research contexts.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

TL;DR: The paper presents Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a method for handling missing time-series data in federated learning with electronic health records, demonstrating its effectiveness on sepsis onset prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the issue of missing time-series data in federated learning settings where institutions record data at varying temporal granularities, affecting collaborative performance.

Method: FMI constructs global transition models for temporal imputation in a privacy-preserving manner, specifically designed for use in distributed ICU data environments.

Result: FMI showed superior performance in sepsis onset predictions from the MIMIC-IV dataset, exceeding the accuracy of local imputation baselines and performing well under irregular ICU sampling conditions.

Conclusion: FMI effectively addresses missing data challenges in federated learning, demonstrating both practicality and improved imputation accuracy within privacy constraints.

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic
health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at
varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov
Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units
(ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal
imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using
the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines,
especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

*Junyu Guo,Shangding Gu,Ming Jin,Costas Spanos,Javad Lavaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces StyleBench, a benchmark to evaluate how different reasoning styles impact the performance of LLMs across various models and tasks, revealing that no reasoning style is universally best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning styles in LLM prompts interact with model architecture and task types, as this relationship is poorly understood.

Method: Developed StyleBench to evaluate five reasoning styles (CoT, ToT, AoT, SoT, CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source LLMs of various scales and architectures.

Result: Findings show no universal reasoning style is optimal; style effectiveness depends on task type and model scale. For example, search-based methods perform well in open-ended tasks with large models, while concise styles improve efficiency in well-defined tasks.

Conclusion: Optimal reasoning strategies for LLMs depend on task specificity and model size. Open-sourced benchmark offers insights for choosing effective reasoning approaches based on constraints.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

*Armin Karamzade,Kyungmin Kim,JB Lanier,Davide Corsi,Roy Fox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses random sensor delays in RL environments with POMDPs, proposing a model-based filtering method and framework for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor delays are common in real-world environments, but standard RL algorithms assume instantaneous observation processing, neglecting out-of-sequence observations.

Method: A model-based filtering process updates the belief state as observations stream in, incorporated into a delay-aware RL framework, applied to Dreamer for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method outperformed delay-aware baselines for MDPs, demonstrated robustness to delay distribution shifts, and showed value in simulated robotic task experiments.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling observation delays in RL leads to improved performance and robustness compared to naive approaches and heuristics.

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

### [263] [Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20877)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a client selection method in federated learning to handle data imbalance by aligning participant label distributions with either a balanced target or the federation's combined label distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle data imbalance among clients that reduces shared model performance in federated learning.

Method: The authors propose a distribution-controlled client selection approach to align the current label distribution of active clients with specific target distributions (balanced or federation's combined).

Result: Empirical evaluations on three federated learning strategies and two datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with specific alignment approaches showing superiority for addressing local or global imbalance.

Conclusion: Aligning label distribution with a balanced target works best for local imbalances, while using the federation's combined label distribution aids global imbalance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

### [264] [Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885)
*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a federated learning framework combined with an attention-enhanced LSTM model to predict sepsis onset across multiple ICUs without sharing patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset in ICU settings while addressing the limitations posed by data privacy and the lack of diverse, centralized training data.

Method: The study proposes a federated learning approach using an attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained on multi-center ICU data, allowing for collaborative model training without centralized data and enabling variable prediction horizons.

Result: The model achieves performance comparable to centralized models and demonstrates efficacy for early sepsis detection, particularly with larger prediction windows, while reducing computational and organizational costs.

Conclusion: The federated learning model enables privacy-preserving, effective sepsis prediction, supporting flexible prediction windows and improving outcomes, especially for early diagnosis, with reduced overhead.

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

*Hideyuki Suzuki,Hiroshi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deterministic algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models that replaces stochastic denoising, improving efficiency and quality in text and image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study addresses the need for more efficient and high-quality generative modeling in discrete-state settings, without relying on retraining or continuous state embeddings.

Method: The authors propose a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics to enable deterministic reverse processes in Markov chain-based diffusion models.

Result: The proposed deterministic method yields consistent improvements in efficiency and sample quality across text and image generation tasks.

Conclusion: Deterministic reverse processes can be effective in discrete-state generative modeling, enhancing the utility of discrete diffusion approaches.

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

*Ariadna Albors Zumel,Michele Tizzoni,Gian Maria Campedelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores a deep learning method (ConvLSTM) incorporating micro-level mobility, sociodemographic, and historical data for crime prediction, showing superior performance in diverse cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance predictive accuracy in crime forecasting at fine spatial and temporal resolutions by integrating mobility data with existing crime and sociodemographic data.

Method: Data from 2019-2023, including crime incidents, sociodemographic factors, and human mobility, were aggregated into grid cells and used to train ConvLSTM models. Performance was compared to logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTMs.

Result: Incorporating mobility with sociodemographic data improved predictions, with ConvLSTM outperforming baselines. Longer data sequences worked better for violent crimes, while shorter sequences excelled for property crimes.

Conclusion: Integrating diverse data, including mobility, is crucial for accurate crime predictions, but deep learning approaches have their limits at fine-grained scales.

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce energy losses, operating costs, and environmental impact in heavy machinery actuators.

Method: Compared hydraulic circuits (PFCV and PDCV) via MATLAB/Simulink simulations and experiments, accounting for PID control tuned by a fuzzy controller.

Result: The PFCV-equipped circuit showed an 8.5% improvement in energy efficiency compared to traditional PDCV circuits.

Conclusion: The proposed PFCV-based hydraulic circuit can enhance the energy efficiency of excavator booms while minimizing environmental and operational impacts.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces GenFacts, a framework designed to create plausible, interpretable counterfactual explanations specifically for multivariate time series data, addressing key limitations of earlier methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterfactual explanation methods for multivariate time series often fail to produce valid, plausible, and intuitive results, undermining their practical usefulness.

Method: The authors propose GenFacts, a generative framework built upon a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It combines prototype-based initialization, realism-constrained optimization, and contrastive and classification-consistency objectives.

Result: GenFacts outperforms state-of-the-art methods in plausibility by 18.7% and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study, as evaluated on radar gesture data and handwritten letter trajectories.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes that focusing on plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity, is essential for actionable counterfactual explanations in time series data.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

*Zida Liang,Jiayi Zhu,Weiqiang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers often underperform in time-series forecasting due to their failure to properly utilize the attention mechanism and embedding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why transformer-based architectures underperform in time-series forecasting compared to simpler models.

Method: Conducted experiments progressively transforming transformers into MLPs and designed interpretable datasets to investigate the attention mechanism.

Result: Discovered that attention mechanisms often degrade into MLP-like behavior and are hindered by flawed embedding methods in time-series transformers.

Conclusion: Current embedding methods fail to establish a structured latent space, leading to the inefficacy of attention mechanisms in time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA) to improve Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) for high-dimensional regression tasks, showing significant performance gains over standard approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFNs are a fast alternative to Gaussian Process (GP) inference but struggle with high-dimensional tasks due to limitations in standard Transformer attention.

Method: The authors propose Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA), which separates input similarities from label propagation, mirroring Gaussian process updates but remaining kernel-free.

Result: DVA-based PFNs achieved over 50% reduction in out-of-sample validation loss in high-dimensional settings and provided 64-dimensional approximations with a mean absolute error of 1E-3, 80x faster than exact GP inference.

Conclusion: The attention mechanism is more critical than the architecture in PFNs, with localized attention significantly enhancing performance in high-dimensional regression tasks.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

*Weili Zeng,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses a critical instability in flow-matching models, introducing Local Contrastive Flow (LCF) to resolve low-noise pathologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability in flow matching models at low noise levels, which causes ill-conditioning and degrades semantic representation quality.

Method: Introduces Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training approach that uses contrastive feature alignment for low noise levels and traditional flow matching for higher noise levels.

Result: LCF stabilizes the training process, improves convergence speed, and enhances representation quality in flow-matching models.

Conclusion: Addressing low-noise pathologies is vital for unlocking the full potential of flow-matching models in both generative modeling and representation learning.

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MixGate, a framework for multiview self-supervised learning on Boolean circuits, solving the problem of heterogeneity in graph representations through functional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address structural heterogeneity across Boolean circuit views which obstructs the effective use of self-supervised techniques like masked modeling.

Method: A training curriculum first aligns views functionally using Equivalence Alignment Loss, enabling effective multiview masked modeling only after establishing a shared functional representation.

Result: Experiments and ablation studies confirm that functional alignment significantly boosts the performance of masked modeling techniques.

Conclusion: Functional alignment is essential for unlocking multiview self-supervised learning, converting masked modeling into a robust performance-enhancing approach.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling

*Michael S. Yao,Osbert Bastani,Alma Andersson,Tommaso Biancalani,Aïcha Bentaieb,Claudia Iriondo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "LEON," an approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific knowledge to optimize personalized treatment plans, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of creating effective personalized treatment plans using surrogate models, which often fail to generalize to unseen combinations due to limited prior knowledge. It seeks to leverage domain-specific knowledge such as medical literature to improve reliability.

Method: The authors propose 'LEON,' which utilizes LLMs to generate treatment designs through entropy-guided optimization without specific fine-tuning. It uses 'optimization by prompting' to contextualize unstructured medical knowledge for proposing individualized treatments.

Result: LEON demonstrated superior performance in real-world optimization tasks for generating personalized treatment plans compared to both traditional optimization techniques and existing LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge offers a significant advantage in proposing effective and individualized treatment plans, making LEON a promising tool for personalized medicine.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

### [274] [CLUE: Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20977)
*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLUE, a methodology using circuit discovery and mechanistic interpretability to unlearn specific knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving essential knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in current LLM unlearning methods, which struggle to disentangle forgetting undesirable information from retaining essential skills and risk over-forgetting or incomplete erasure.

Method: CLUE uses circuit discovery to identify neurons responsible for forgetting and retaining, transforms these circuits into conjunctive normal forms (CNF), and applies targeted fine-tuning strategies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CLUE outperforms traditional localization methods in effectively removing target knowledge while retaining non-target capabilities.

Conclusion: CLUE provides a robust, precise framework for addressing LLM unlearning challenges, balancing knowledge removal and retention more effectively.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

*Xiangyu Dong,Xingyi Zhang,Sibo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FracAug is a novel framework for graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) that enhances Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using semantic graph augmentation and pseudo-labeling, achieving significant performance improvements across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-level anomaly detection suffers from high labeling costs and dataset imbalance, limiting the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks. A solution to improve upon these issues is necessary.

Method: FracAug addresses these issues by learning graph semantics, generating fractional graph variants using a weighted distance-aware margin loss, and pseudo-labeling unlabeled data through mutual verification between original and augmented graphs. The framework is compatible with multiple GNN architectures.

Result: Experimental results across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent improvements in metrics, with gains of up to 5.72% in AUROC, 7.23% in AUPRC, and 4.18% in F1-score.

Conclusion: FracAug demonstrates that semantic augmentation and pseudo-labeling can effectively mitigate the challenges of high labeling costs and data imbalance, making it a universal and impactful addition to GNNs for GAD.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CATCH-FM, a cancer pre-screening methodology leveraging EHR foundation models to predict high-risk patients, showing strong performance with high sensitivity and specificity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cancer screening techniques are limited by their high cost, intrusiveness, and lack of global accessibility, leading to preventable deaths.

Method: The approach utilizes EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, models scaled to 2.4 billion parameters, and fine-tunes them for cancer risk prediction using curated datasets.

Result: CATCH-FM achieves 60% sensitivity, 99% specificity, and superior performance compared to tree-based and language models. Furthermore, it leads in pancreatic cancer prediction on the EHRSHOT leaderboard.

Conclusion: CATCH-FM provides a robust and effective mechanism for pre-screening cancer risk, democratizing access to early detection while identifying non-trivial risk factors. The code will be made open-source.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes "LCR", a learning-based GPU caching framework, that improves inference performance while ensuring robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve GPU cache efficiency in modern inference tasks like recommendation models and large language models, overcoming limitations of heuristic policies and current learning-based approaches.

Method: Introduces "LCR" framework featuring "LARU," which combines LRU with machine-learned predictions and online error estimation to dynamically adapt to prediction accuracy.

Result: LCR delivers up to 24.2% improvement in throughput and up to 28.3% reduction in P99 TTFT in realistic scenarios for DLRM and LLM, demonstrating consistent gains and stability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between theoretical advances and practical utility in GPU caching, achieving both performance gains and robustness even under inaccurate predictions.

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

### [278] [Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Brian M. Kurkoski,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Binary Autoencoder (BAE) for improving feature sparsity and interpretability in Large Language Models (LLMs) by enforcing global sparsity through entropy minimization of hidden activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature extraction methods that interpret hidden states of LLMs often struggle with ensuring global sparsity and independence, leading to inefficient and dense feature representations.

Method: The proposed BAE enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations to promote feature independence and sparsity. It discretizes hidden activations into binary values for efficient entropy calculation and employs gradient estimation to maintain backpropagation capabilities.

Result: BAE effectively calculates feature set entropy and untangles interpretable features from LLM hidden states. It produces the largest number of interpretable features while avoiding dense and inactive features compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The Binary Autoencoder (BAE) offers a more effective and interpretable method for feature extraction in LLMs, advancing the understanding of their mechanisms and improving sparsity and feature independence across instances.

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

*Qingyu Han,Qian Li,Linxin Yang,Qian Chen,Qingjiang Shi,Ruoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes ColorGNN and ColorUID methods based on Local-UID schemes to address the limitations of traditional GNNs in solving ILPs, demonstrating improvements in expressiveness, generalization, and benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ILPs are important yet difficult to solve, and current Graph Neural Networks have limitations in expressiveness and generalization due to issues with anonymous nodes or globally unique identifiers.

Method: The authors propose Local-UID schemes using d-hop uniqueness coloring and derive two variants: ColorGNN, with color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lighter feature-level alternative. These approaches improve GNN expressiveness without sacrificing generalization capabilities.

Result: The proposed methods show significant improvements in ILP benchmarks, robust out-of-distribution generalization on linear programming datasets, and enhanced performance on a general graph-level task when combined with a state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: The Local-UID-based ColorGNN and ColorUID methods achieve the expressiveness of global identifiers while addressing overfitting issues, making them effective and generalizable for solving ILPs and related graph-based tasks.

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

### [280] [Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21002)
*Meng Wan,Benxi Tian,Jue Wang,Cui Hui,Ningming Nie,Tiantian Liu,Zongguo Wang,Cao Rongqiang,Peng Shi,Yangang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes using lossless compression to evaluate time series models by linking compression length to negative log-likelihood, offering a unified metric for modeling capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluations of time series models focus on specific tasks like forecasting and classification but fail to assess the complete generative distribution captured by models.

Method: The authors establish a connection between lossless compression and negative log-likelihood using Shannon's source coding theorem, propose evaluation protocols, and introduce TSCom-Bench for testing models.

Result: The framework identifies distributional weaknesses in models (e.g., TimeXer, iTransformer, PatchTST) that standard benchmarks miss, illustrating the utility of compression-based evaluation.

Conclusion: Lossless compression provides a rigorous, information-theoretic way to evaluate time series models, complementing existing task-specific benchmarks and enhancing assessment methods.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

*Seokbin Yoon,Keumjin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAIFormer, a novel neural architecture leveraging attention mechanisms to predict and explain multi-agent flight trajectories, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the challenges of predicting multi-agent flight trajectories, including capturing individual aircraft behaviors, modeling complex aircraft interactions, and ensuring explainability in predictions.

Method: The authors propose MAIFormer, which integrates two attention modules: masked multivariate attention for spatio-temporal modeling of individual aircraft and agent attention for capturing interactions among multiple flights.

Result: MAIFormer demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and interpretability when evaluated on a real-world dataset from Incheon International Airport, surpassing existing methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: MAIFormer is an effective and interpretable tool for multi-agent flight trajectory prediction, offering valuable advancements for air traffic control applications.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

*Haotian Guo,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ExMoIRL, a framework that combines phenotype-based and target-specific methods for molecule generation, offering improved drug properties and effectiveness in drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing high-quality candidate molecules remains challenging due to limitations in existing phenotype-based and target-based strategies, such as high costs or neglecting cellular responses.

Method: The proposed method uses ExMoIRL, which integrates phenotype-guided generative models pretrained on transcriptional profiles and fine-tunes them via multi-objective reinforcement learning. A detailed reward function includes docking affinity, drug-likeness scores, ranking loss, and regularization techniques.

Result: Experiments show that ExMoIRL outperforms state-of-the-art models, generating molecules with better drug-like properties, high target affinity, and significant inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the synergistic benefits of combining phenotype-guided and target-specific strategies, presenting an improved approach for de novo drug discovery.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

### [283] [Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012)
*Hakaze Cho,Haolin Yang,Gouki Minegishi,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how in-context learning (ICL) in language models works by proposing that it operates via information removal in hidden states, focusing representations on specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanism of how in-context learning (ICL) functions in language models, which is currently unclear.

Method: The study utilizes a low-rank filter to remove specific information from hidden states, designs metrics to analyze hidden state representations, and identifies key attention heads (Denoising Heads) responsible for selective information removal.

Result: Finds that the removal of irrelevant information directs language models toward task-specific goals, improving few-shot learning performance, with a critical role played by Denoising Heads.

Conclusion: The mechanism of ICL operates by selectively removing redundant task-irrelevant information, and Denoising Heads are essential for achieving task-focused representations and improving accuracy.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

*Woosung Koh,Juyoung Suk,Sungjun Han,Se-Young Yun,Jay Shin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces rBridge, a method that uses smaller proxies (≤1 billion parameters) to predict large language model reasoning capabilities, optimizing datasets while reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome the challenges of dataset optimization for reasoning tasks, which require large language models, due to their prohibitive pre-training costs.

Method: Small proxy models align with pre-training objectives and target tasks by integrating weighted negative log-likelihood using reasoning traces from advanced models as gold labels.

Result: rBridge reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x, achieves strong correlation across reasoning benchmarks (1B to 32B scale), and enables zero-shot transfer of predictive relationships across datasets (1B to 7B scale).

Conclusion: rBridge demonstrates that reasoning-oriented pre-training can be explored at lower costs using smaller proxy models, offering both efficacy and scalability.

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

*Yiyou Sun,Yuhan Cao,Pohao Huang,Haoyue Bai,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Nouha Dziri,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces DELTA-Code, a benchmark for examining whether large language models (LLMs) can acquire new reasoning strategies and their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution coding problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether LLMs can learn novel reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning (RL) and transfer these skills to out-of-distribution test sets, rather than solely relying on pre-trained or memorized knowledge.

Method: The team developed DELTA-Code, a synthetic coding benchmark that uses templated problem generators to isolate reasoning skills. They investigated training strategies like staged warm-up, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop to enable LLMs to solve previously unsolvable problems.

Result: The experiments showed a grokking phase transition where, after a long period of near-zero rewards, RL-trained models abruptly achieved near-perfect accuracy. Gains within problem families and for recomposed skills were observed, but the models exhibited weaknesses in transforming skills across families or under new distributions.

Conclusion: DELTA-Code provides an effective framework for understanding how RL-driven training can push LLMs beyond pre-existing priors, enabling the acquisition and partial generalization of novel algorithmic skills.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

### [286] [Actor-Critic without Actor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21022)
*Donghyeon Ki,Hee-Jun Ahn,Kyungyoon Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, "Actor-Critic without Actor" (ACA), which eliminates the need for an explicit actor network, simplifying training and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of architectural complexity and hyperparameter tuning in actor-critic methods, as well as the computational burden of diffusion-based policies.

Method: ACA replaces an explicit actor network with actions generated directly from a noise-level critic's gradient field, ensuring streamlined training and efficient policy improvement.

Result: ACA demonstrates favorable learning curves and competitive performance against standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods on online RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: ACA combines simplicity with expressive modeling capabilities, offering an efficient and robust approach for reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

### [287] [FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21029)
*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) caused by visual jailbreaking attacks and introduces the FORCE method to improve cross-model attack transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to assess and improve the robustness of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against visual jailbreaking attacks, especially given their limited transferability between open-source and closed-source models.

Method: The authors propose the Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which mitigates improper reliance on narrow layer and semantically poor spectral features to improve attack generalizability and cross-model transferability.

Result: Their analysis shows that current jailbreaking attacks are confined to high-sharpness regions, limiting their transferability. The proposed FORCE method identifies flattened feasible regions and enhances attack effectiveness in evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: The FORCE method enables more robust visual red-teaming evaluations for multimodal large language models by improving the cross-model transferability of jailbreaking attacks.

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

### [288] [Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21044)
*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores internal differences in large language models (LLMs) before and after reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning, revealing key patterns in activation intensity and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why RL fine-tuning improves LLMs and investigate the mechanisms behind these enhancements, particularly in comparison to supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Edge attribution patching (EAP) inspired analysis was applied to examine internal activation patterns and flow in different LLM families post RL fine-tuning.

Result: RL fine-tuning led to increased activation intensity and greater diversity in activation patterns, suggesting more flexible and redundant information flow. However, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) diverged from these trends.

Conclusion: RL fine-tuning systematically reshapes LLMs’ internal pathways, enhancing generalization capabilities, while preference-based methods exhibit distinct effects.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

*Bing Liu,Wenqiang Yv,Xuzheng Yang,Shichang Wang,Junzhuo Liu,Peng Wang,Guoqing Wang,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeoRef, a benchmark dataset for solving geometric problems using Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), and demonstrates model improvements using synthetic training data and novel fine-tuning and verification strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of AI-driven geometric problem solving, which requires accurate cross-modal grounding to identify and interpret geometric elements using natural language.

Method: The authors created GeoRef, built a synthetic training dataset in geometric formal language, and explored two fine-tuning methods: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), alongside a verify-and-regenerate mechanism.

Result: GRPO significantly outperformed SFT in aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards, and the verify-and-regenerate mechanism improved accuracy. Even advanced models struggled with the task, showing the area’s complexity.

Conclusion: The work highlights the importance of strengthening geometric grounding for robust problem-solving and demonstrates the effectiveness of REC on improving downstream geometric reasoning tasks, setting a foundation for further multimodal mathematical research.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPREAD is a generative framework leveraging denoising diffusion models for multi-objective optimization, demonstrating strong performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently computing Pareto sets for multi-objective optimization is challenging, particularly for large-scale and expensive problems.

Method: SPREAD uses conditional diffusion processes with adaptive gradient descent-inspired updates and Gaussian RBF-based repulsion for optimization.

Result: SPREAD matches or surpasses baseline methods in performance, scalability, and quality of Pareto front coverage across benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPREAD is a promising and scalable approach for multi-objective optimization problems, offering both efficiency and diversity in solutions.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

*Zhen Liu,Yongtao Zhang,Shaobo Ren,Yuxin You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SATMC is a novel graph domain adaptation framework tackling structural heterogeneity and domain-private information, achieving superior cross-network node classification results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph domain adaptation methods struggle with structural heterogeneity across domains, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The SATMC framework combines graph structure and attribute transformations with domain-private information reduction and empirical Wasserstein distance for enhanced generalization.

Result: SATMC achieves a tighter error bound theoretically and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments across nine cross-domain datasets.

Conclusion: SATMC proves to be a highly effective solution for cross-network node classification tasks, addressing limitations of current approaches and bringing significant advancements.

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The

### [292] [ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21070)
*Qizhi Pei,Zhuoshi Pan,Honglin Lin,Xin Gao,Yu Li,Zinan Tang,Conghui He,Rui Yan,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff proposes a scalable and cost-efficient approach to synthesize difficult reasoning problems, improving LRMs' performance through adaptive filtering, specialized problem generation, and fine-tuning alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of computational costs, complex prompting, and limited difficulty level in synthesizing mathematical problems, aiming to scale approaches effectively.

Method: Utilize an adaptive thinking model for filtering difficult problems, train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B), and fine-tune reasoning models with the ScaleDiff-Math dataset to enhance performance.

Result: The refined Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct model achieves 65.9% accuracy on advanced benchmarks, improving by 11.3% over the original datasets and outperforming recent models, while demonstrating cost efficiency.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff introduces an efficient alternative for reasoning model development, showing scalable gains in performance metrics while reducing reliance on expensive computational resources.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

### [293] [TyphoonMLA: A Mixed Naive-Absorb MLA Kernel For Shared Prefix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21081)
*Ahmet Caner Yüzügüler,Ahmet Çelik,Jiawei Zhuang,Lukas Cavigelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA combines naive and absorb formulations of Multi-Head Latent Attention to enhance throughput by up to 3.24x on neural processing units (NPUs) and GPUs, demonstrating a trade-off between computational efficiency and bandwidth usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address inefficiencies in current decoding kernel implementations, which fail to exploit data reuse opportunities and are compute-bound, particularly when employing the absorb method.

Method: TyphoonMLA adopts a hybrid approach, applying the naive formulation for compute-intensive parts of attention calculations and the absorb formulation for non-shared components, enabling effective utilization of shared prefixes and bandwidth savings.

Result: TyphoonMLA achieves up to 3x and 3.24x throughput improvements on NPUs and GPUs, respectively, while maintaining minimal overhead in high-bandwidth memory (HBM).

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA successfully balances computational workload and memory bandwidth usage in MLA architectures, presenting a significant advancement over existing attention mechanisms like FlashMLA.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

### [294] [GraphUniverse: Enabling Systematic Evaluation of Inductive Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21097)
*Louis Van Langendonck,Guillermo Bernárdez,Nina Miolane,Pere Barlet-Ros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphUniverse, a framework for systematically evaluating inductive generalization across families of graphs by generating graphs with consistent semantic communities and controllable structural properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of graph learning benchmarks which predominantly focus on transductive settings within a single graph, thereby neglecting the study of inductive generalization across graphs.

Method: The authors proposed GraphUniverse, which generates graph families with persistent semantic communities and fine-tuned structural properties. This setup enables controlled distribution tests and robustness analysis under various conditions.

Result: Evaluation of diverse architectures indicates that strong transductive performance does not guarantee inductive generalization. Robustness to distribution shifts is also significantly influenced by architecture choice and graph characteristics such as homophily.

Conclusion: GraphUniverse offers a scalable framework to study inductive generalization and can pave the way for the development of robust graph-learning models, including next-gen graph foundation models.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

*Xiefeng Wu,Jing Zhao,Shu Zhang,Mingyu Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes VARL, a framework that uses vision-language models to improve the efficiency of online reinforcement learning by providing action suggestions, especially in sparse-reward tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online reinforcement learning requires significant time and interaction steps to optimize the Q-function, and existing vision-language action policies struggle with low-level control and need task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: The VARL framework uses vision-language models to provide action suggestions to reinforcement learning agents, enhancing sample diversity and efficiency without altering optimality or convergence.

Result: VARL demonstrated improved sample efficiency across various environments and agent settings while avoiding substantial computational overhead.

Conclusion: VARL is a general framework for reinforcement learning, making it practical for real-world online learning tasks by boosting efficiency and preserving scalability.

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

*Wei Huang,De-Tian Chu,Lin-Yuan Bai,Wei Kang,Hai-Tao Zhang,Bo Li,Zhi-Mo Han,Jing Ge,Hai-Feng Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EvoMail, a self-evolving framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models to combat increasingly sophisticated spam and phishing attacks, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern spam attacks combine various techniques to bypass static filters, requiring advanced methods to integrate multi-modal signals and adapt continuously.

Method: EvoMail builds heterogeneous email graphs that incorporate text, metadata, and attachments, employs context-aware reasoning via Cognitive Graph Neural Networks and LLMs, and enhances adaptability with an adversarial self-evolution loop.

Result: EvoMail achieved superior detection accuracy, adaptability to novel spam tactics, and interpretability compared to existing baselines in tests using diverse real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: EvoMail demonstrates promise as a robust, adaptive, and explainable defense against evolving email spam and phishing campaigns.

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

*Killian Steunou,Sigurd Saue,Théo Druilhe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores linear dimensionality reduction, comparing PCA and SPCA, for adversarial robustness in neural networks. SPCA consistently outperforms PCA in maintaining accuracy under adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models, while excelling in image classification, are prone to adversarial perturbations. The paper explores whether sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) can offer better defense mechanisms compared to PCA.

Method: The study involves both empirical experiments and theoretical analyses. PCA and SPCA are compared as feature extractors for downstream classifiers, followed by theoretical robustness guarantees for SPCA and analysis of its impact on non-linear classifiers.

Result: SPCA features lead to better robustness against adversarial attacks across white-box and black-box scenarios while maintaining clean accuracy. The robustness is traced theoretically to the sparsity of the projections.

Conclusion: SPCA reduces adversarial vulnerability through sparser projections, with both theory and experiments validating its ability to outperform PCA in robustness without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduced the LAVA method for interpreting unsupervised black-box models by relating input features to latent embedding neighborhoods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in interpreting unsupervised black-box models, especially understanding multi-dimensional latent embeddings.

Method: Developed a post-hoc model-agnostic method called LAVA that describes correlations between features across neighborhoods in latent spaces.

Result: LAVA successfully captured visually and biologically relevant local patterns in UMAP embeddings of MNIST and single-cell kidney datasets.

Conclusion: LAVA provides meaningful explanations for unsupervised latent structures, aiding scientific discovery and model interpretability.

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

*Ruiyu Wang,Shizhao Sun,Weijian Ma,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAD-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework for text-guided CAD prototyping that overcomes challenges in geometric and sequential representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of unifying Text-to-CAD generation and CAD editing for streamlined design pipelines, which prior work has not effectively explored due to limitations in standard large language model tokenizers.

Method: The authors propose CAD-Tokenizer, a sequence-based VQ-VAE framework with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding, which generates modality-specific tokens that capture CAD's structural and geometric semantics.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that CAD-Tokenizer significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines in instruction following and generation quality for CAD tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CAD-Tokenizer framework creates more effective CAD representations, enabling improved performance in unified text-guided CAD prototyping and paving the way for more efficient design pipelines.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

### [300] [GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21154)
*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a problematic aspect of the GRPO RL algorithm and introduces a simple fix that improves LLM performance and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand and address a flaw in the GRPO RL algorithm, which could hinder optimization and performance of large language models (LLMs).

Method: They analyze GRPO theoretically, empirically validate assumptions about token overlaps, propose a modified algorithm ($\lambda$-GRPO), and evaluate its superiority in model accuracy and training speed.

Result: The modified $\lambda$-GRPO outperforms standard GRPO in validation accuracy, downstream reasoning tasks, and efficiency of reaching peak performance.

Conclusion: The study suggests that it is possible to enhance GRPO's utility by leveraging its intrinsic process reward model without incurring additional costs.

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

### [301] [DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21161)
*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of improving both predictive performance and calibration in Continual Learning setups by introducing the Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS) method, which adjusts confidence calibration per task without prior task information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the Catastrophic Forgetting problem in Continual Learning while ensuring reliable and calibrated uncertainty estimates in safety-critical applications, which current CL calibration methods fail to address effectively due to their task-invariant approach.

Method: The paper introduces Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), a technique that leverages prototype-based distance estimation to infer task proximity and adaptively adjust the temperature for calibration, without requiring task information at test time.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard and real-world imbalanced datasets, including in the biomedical domain, show that DATS improves calibration stability and reduces calibration error across tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DATS method is effective in addressing calibration challenges in Continual Learning, demonstrating its potential for stable and consistent performance in real-world applications, particularly in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

### [302] [Mixture of Thoughts: Learning to Aggregate What Experts Think, Not Just What They Say](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21164)
*Jacob Fein-Ashley,Dhruv Parikh,Rajgopal Kannan,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a method for efficient latent-level collaboration among diverse large language models (LLMs), outperforming previous state-of-the-art benchmarks with minimal runtime overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing specialization of open-source LLMs by domain creates a need for systems that leverage the complementary strengths of diverse models without major efficiency losses.

Method: MoT uses a global routing scheme where a lightweight router selects top-$K$ models for collaboration. Interaction layers project hidden states into a shared latent space for cross-attention, enabling collaboration among frozen, pre-trained experts. A novel joint training objective enhances expert selection and interaction effectiveness.

Result: MoT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, achieving +0.38% and +2.92% improvements over leading approaches, respectively, while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: MoT is a practical and effective solution for combining heterogeneous LLMs, enabling improved performance without added runtime overhead or architectural constraints.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

*Nicola Novello,Federico Fontana,Luigi Cinque,Deniz Gunduz,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This research proposes a unified $f$-divergence framework to improve machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models, providing more flexibility in balancing unlearning quality and concept preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance machine unlearning methodologies for diffusion models in text-to-image applications by offering an enhanced theoretical and practical framework.

Method: The method adopts a unified $f$-divergence-based approach, which extends existing MSE-based unlearning techniques to allow the use of different $f$-divergences for optimal performance.

Result: The framework demonstrates that selecting appropriate $f$-divergences influences the unlearning algorithm's convergence and the trade-offs between aggressive knowledge removal and concept preservation.

Conclusion: The unified $f$-divergence framework provides a flexible and optimal paradigm for machine unlearning in T2I diffusion models, enabling tailored solutions for different applications.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

### [304] [Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190)
*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TimeRCD, a new model for time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which uses a novel Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD) pre-training approach to address limitations of reconstruction-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSAD models fail to generalize in zero-shot scenarios and struggle with accuracy due to reliance on reconstruction-based objectives, leading to false positives and negatives.

Method: TimeRCD uses the RCD paradigm where it is trained to detect anomalies via discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This method is implemented with a Transformer architecture and pre-trained on a synthetic corpus with anomaly labels.

Result: Experiments show that TimeRCD outperforms existing foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across various datasets.

Conclusion: TimeRCD and its RCD paradigm represent a significant improvement in TSAD models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable approaches in anomaly detection.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

*Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Fan Xu,Fan Zhang,Qingsong Wen,Kun Wang,Xiaomeng Huang,Xian Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Differential-Integral Neural Operator (DINO) for long-term turbulence forecasting, using physics-based operator decomposition to improve accuracy and suppress error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term turbulence forecasting is crucial for applications like climate modeling and aerospace engineering but current deep learning methods fail in long-term predictions due to error accumulation and physical fidelity issues.

Method: The proposed DINO framework uses operator decomposition with a parallel architecture to model turbulence evolution. It combines a local differential operator via constrained convolutional networks and a global integral operator via Transformer architecture.

Result: DINO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, with better stability, suppression of error accumulation, and physical fidelity in vorticity fields and energy spectra.

Conclusion: DINO establishes a new benchmark for accurate and stable long-term turbulence forecasting, proving the efficacy of its physics-based design approach.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

TL;DR: The paper discusses using physics-informed machine learning to address limitations in Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), enabling better predictions and decision-making while dealing with noisy data, limited labels, and system complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency, reliability, and safety of complex systems by overcoming challenges in PHM, like noisy/incomplete data, limited labels, and nonlinear degradation behaviors.

Method: Integrates physical knowledge into machine learning models through physics-informed losses, governing equations, virtual sensing, simulation, multi-sensor fusion, and reinforcement learning strategies.

Result: The research demonstrates improved prediction accuracy, adaptability, and active decision-making in PHM systems, paving the way for scalable deployment across asset fleets.

Conclusion: Embedding physical knowledge enhances model reliability, captures real-world behavior effectively, supports adaptive decision-making, and facilitates scalable PHM solutions for maintaining complex assets.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

*Yuxiang Ji,Ziyu Ma,Yong Wang,Guanhua Chen,Xiangxiang Chu,Liaoni Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tree-GRPO, a reinforcement learning method based on tree search, to improve multi-turn agent tasks of LLMs by addressing sparse supervision issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods relying only on outcome rewards face challenges like sparse supervision in long-term and multi-turn agent tasks.

Method: The authors propose Tree-GRPO, which utilizes tree search where each node represents an agent interaction step. It increases rollouts through shared prefixes and extracts step-wise supervised signals using outcome rewards.

Result: Tree-GRPO provides grouped relative advantages at intra-tree and inter-tree levels, validated by theoretical analysis and outperforming chain-based RL methods in 11 datasets and 3 QA task types.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO demonstrates the potential of tree-structured trajectories in RL for enhancing long-term agent tasks with large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using counterfactuals and knowledge graphs to explain the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs, focusing on their structural dependencies and semantic shifts post LoRA adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of fine-tuning mechanisms, like LoRA, on structural reasoning and semantic behavior of LLMs remains a challenge.

Method: The authors designed the CFFTLLMExplainer, which uses counterfactual-based explanations grounded in a bioinformatics-specific knowledge graph (BioToolKG) through learning soft masks to induce structural and semantic shifts.

Result: The framework applied to a fine-tuned LLaMA model effectively revealed structural dependencies aligned with LoRA-induced parameter changes.

Conclusion: Counterfactual graphs serve as valuable tools for explaining and interpreting fine-tuned LLMs, providing deeper insights into their mechanisms.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Federated Flow Matching (FFM) to train generative models without centralizing data, achieving privacy and performance comparable to centralized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises from the challenge of training models on decentralized data while safeguarding privacy and complying with regulations.

Method: The authors present three approaches: FFM-vanilla with local training on independent couplings, FFM-LOT using local optimal transport for straighter flows, and FFM-GOT employing a global potential function for coordination across clients.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved flow straightness and sample quality in federated settings, achieving performance similar to centralized systems.

Conclusion: FFM effectively supports privacy-preserving, decentralized generative model training, balancing privacy and performance.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AirPCM, a deep learning model addressing spatiotemporal air pollution forecasting challenges, improving interpretability and prediction accuracy over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution poses risks to health, environment, and climate, demanding scalable and accurate forecasting methods that capture complex pollutant dynamics.

Method: AirPCM integrates spatial correlations, temporal patterns, and meteorology-pollutant causality into a unified deep spatiotemporal forecasting architecture.

Result: Through real-world dataset tests, AirPCM outperforms existing models in accuracy and generalization while enabling long-term forecasting of air quality trends.

Conclusion: AirPCM enhances multi-pollutant forecasting and provides evidence-based tools to guide environmental policies, mitigating pollution and supporting sustainability efforts.

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PSPO, an alternative to ratio clipping in RL training for LLMs, improving model stability and performance significantly over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of ratio clipping in RL-based training of LLMs, tackling issues of information loss and gradient discontinuities.

Method: The authors propose PSPO, a probability smoothing technique akin to label smoothing, to provide a soft trust region for stable model updates. They evaluate PSPO by fine-tuning the Qwen2.5 series models and benchmarking their reasoning performance.

Result: GR-PSPO delivers significantly better results than clipped GRPO. For example, it improved GSM8K test performance by over 20% for both 0.5B and 1.5B models.

Conclusion: PSPO offers a stable and effective alternative to ratio clipping, preserving gradient signals and boosting logical reasoning in LLMs during fine-tuning with RL techniques.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

### [314] [Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293)
*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a new algorithm for generating robust recourse recommendations in algorithmic decision-making systems, which are resilient to updates in models. This method achieves lower costs and better trade-offs compared to prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individuals receiving unfavorable decisions (e.g., loan rejection) need effective strategies to achieve desirable outcomes even when models are updated, and prior robust recourse methods lack optimal and cost-effective solutions.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm that computes optimal robust recourse by modeling changes using the $L^p$ norm (where $p \geq 1$ but $p \neq \infty$), addressing limitations of previous $L^\infty$ norm-based approaches.

Result: Their algorithm achieves significantly reduced costs (up to several orders of magnitude), provides sparse recourse solutions, and ensures robustness while maintaining feasibility in decision-making systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers improved cost-efficiency, sparse solutions, and resilience in robust recourse modeling, outperforming existing approaches empirically and theoretically.

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development of PWCT2, a self-hosting visual programming language, and its supporting textual programming language, Ring, improving efficiency and user engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the limitations of general-purpose visual programming languages (VPLs) like PWCT, which require textual programming for updates and offer limited flexibility, by creating a next-generation self-hosting VPL.

Method: The authors designed the Ring textual language as a foundation, then used PWCT to develop the Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine. Subsequently, they developed the PWCT2 visual programming language employing Ring, incorporating improvements based on identified issues in PWCT.

Result: PWCT2 was shown to generate code 36 times faster and require 20 times less storage for visual source files compared to its predecessor. The software received positive feedback from over 1,700 users with extensive usage on the Steam platform.

Conclusion: The development and distribution of PWCT2 mark significant progress in self-hosting visual programming languages, demonstrating increased efficiency, abstraction, and user adoption while inviting further development and research.

Abstract: Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few
general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These
general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and
improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and
developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose,
self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically
designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring
is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering
syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific
languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming,
allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or
Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using
the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is
composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which
increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to
develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the
development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual
programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code
generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also
allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation
of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of
approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components.
PWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received
positive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the
total recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research
and development.

### [316] [Efficient Symbolic Computation vis Hash Consing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20534)
*Bowen Zhu,Aayush Sabharwal,Songchen Tan,Yingbo Ma,Alan Edelman,Christopher Rackauckas*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces hash consing into JuliaSymbolics to optimize memory usage and performance in symbolic computations, yielding significant speedups across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Expression swell due to redundant subexpression storage limits efficiency and scalability in symbolic computation systems.

Method: The authors implemented hash consing via a global weak-reference hash table within the JuliaSymbolics toolkit.

Result: Benchmarks show speedups (up to 100x for larger models) and reduced memory usage (up to 2x), enhancing symbolic computation workflows.

Conclusion: Hash consing improves scalability and efficiency in symbolic computations, offering key advancements in high-performance symbolic tools and enabling further integration with e-graphs for extended applications.

Abstract: Symbolic computation systems suffer from memory inefficiencies due to
redundant storage of structurally identical subexpressions, commonly known as
expression swell, which degrades performance in both classical computer algebra
and emerging AI-driven mathematical reasoning tools. In this paper, we present
the first integration of hash consing into JuliaSymbolics, a high-performance
symbolic toolkit in Julia, by employing a global weak-reference hash table that
canonicalizes expressions and eliminates duplication. This approach reduces
memory consumption and accelerates key operations such as differentiation,
simplification, and code generation, while seamlessly integrating with Julia's
metaprogramming and just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Benchmark
evaluations across different computational domains reveal substantial
improvements: symbolic computations are accelerated by up to 3.2 times, memory
usage is reduced by up to 2 times, code generation is up to 5 times faster,
function compilation up to 10 times faster, and numerical evaluation up to 100
times faster for larger models. While certain workloads with fewer duplicate
unknown-variable expressions show more modest gains or even slight overhead in
initial computation stages, downstream processing consistently benefits
significantly. These findings underscore the importance of hash consing in
scaling symbolic computation and pave the way for future work integrating hash
consing with e-graphs for enhanced equivalence-aware expression sharing in
AI-driven pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for improving LiDAR-based localization using semantic camera data, tested with a diverse sensor platform and validated in a 55 km real-world drive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the robustness and accuracy of LiDAR-based localization for autonomous systems, which faces challenges due to diverse sensor configurations.

Method: The method integrates semantic segmentation from cameras with LiDAR data by projecting LiDAR points into the semantic camera space, employing advanced segmentation networks and GNSS-RTK for ground truth.

Result: The study validates the approach using the CoCar NextGen platform and tests it in a real-world 55 km drive across varying environments, showcasing improved localization reliability and precision.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal integration method demonstrates its potential to improve autonomous navigation systems in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

### [319] [Boosting Zero-Shot VLN via Abstract Obstacle Map-Based Waypoint Prediction with TopoGraph-and-VisitInfo-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20499)
*Boqi Li,Siyuan Li,Weiyi Wang,Anran Li,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a zero-shot framework for VLN in continuous environments using a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a waypoint predictor to enable spatial reasoning and exploration. It achieved state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language navigation (VLN) is a complex and essential task for embodied agents, with its difficulty heightened in continuous environments requiring joint interpretation of instructions, perception, and planning.

Method: The approach integrates a waypoint predictor operating on an abstract obstacle map with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). A topological graph with visitation records is dynamically updated, and the graph information is encoded into prompts to aid spatial reasoning and error correction.

Result: The method achieved state-of-the-art zero-shot success rates of 41% on R2R-CE and 36% on RxR-CE, outperforming previous models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances reasoning over spatial structures and exploration history, equipping the MLLM with effective path planning capabilities, proving its value in developing robust VLN systems.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

*Petr Trunin,Diana Cafiso,Anderson Brazil Nardin,Trevor Exley,Lucia Beccai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MELEGROS, a monolithic elephant trunk-inspired soft robotic gripper with integrated optical sensors, achieved through a single 3D print. It combines actuation, sensing, and structural functionality for versatile and delicate manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a soft robotic gripper inspired by the elephant trunk that integrates sensing, actuation, and structural components seamlessly without mechanical mismatches.

Method: Developed MELEGROS using a single continuous 3D print of soft resin with six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic chambers embedded directly in a pneumatically actuated lattice structure. Simulation-guided design was used for sensor placement.

Result: The gripper weighs 132g, lifts over twice its weight, performs complex bioinspired motions, and demonstrates precise, delicate grasping abilities, while its integrated optical sensors enable multifunctional perception.

Conclusion: MELEGROS introduces a new paradigm in soft robotics, demonstrating that fully embedded sensing within a continuous structure supports versatile and bioinspired manipulation, reducing model uncertainty and enhancing performance.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

### [321] [Action-Informed Estimation and Planning: Clearing Clutter on Staircases via Quadrupedal Pedipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20516)
*Prasanna Sriganesh,Barath Satheeshkumar,Anushree Sabnis,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for quadrupedal robots to perceive, plan, and execute object-pushing maneuvers in cluttered and challenging terrains like stairs, addressing occlusion issues during manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots operating in cluttered environments often face challenges like physical interaction with obstacles, especially when objects are occluded during manipulation. Developing solutions for these constraints can enhance task success and autonomy.

Method: The researchers developed a perception-action framework that uses proprioceptive feedback from leg position and contact to predict object displacement when occluded, enabling accurate re-detection and classification of objects after physical manipulation.

Result: Experiments on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot showed that the proposed interaction-aware framework achieved higher success rates and more accurate tracking of objects being pushed compared to traditional open-loop methods.

Conclusion: The perception-action coupling approach improves the robot's ability to interact autonomously with cluttered environments, providing robust solutions for path-clearing tasks in complex terrains.

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

### [322] [Selective Progress-Aware Querying for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20541)
*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ minimizes human feedback while ensuring efficient robot learning by querying only during task stagnation in HiL-RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback accelerates robot learning but is costly and limited in real-world settings.

Method: SPARQ employs a progress-aware query strategy, triggering feedback requests only when learning stagnates or worsens.

Result: SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, uses half the feedback budget compared to always querying, and outperforms random querying and no feedback.

Conclusion: Progress-based querying strategies improve HiL-RL efficiency and scalability under realistic human effort constraints.

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraspFactory, a dataset designed to improve robotic grasping in diverse real-world scenarios by providing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps for different robotic grippers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling diverse objects is vital for robots in industrial settings like warehouses, but existing grasping models fail to generalize well due to limited datasets.

Method: The authors created a large dataset, GraspFactory, with 6-DoF grasp data for two robots, enabling the training of data-intensive models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that models trained on subsets of GraspFactory generalize well to novel objects in simulated and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The GraspFactory dataset fills a crucial gap in robotic grasping research, enhancing generalization for diverse industrial environments.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware system for identifying marine pollution sources using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of accurately tracking pollution sources in marine environments using autonomous systems.

Method: The approach integrates high-fidelity pollution dispersion simulations with informative path planning techniques and processes real-time sensor data using Robot Operating System (ROS).

Result: The framework demonstrates high accuracy in localizing pollution sources under diverse simulated conditions, while quantifying prediction uncertainty.

Conclusion: The framework enhances autonomous environmental monitoring, offering a reliable and efficient tool for responding to marine pollution events.

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

### [325] [Latent Activation Editing: Inference-Time Refinement of Learned Policies for Safer Multirobot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20623)
*Satyajeet Das,Darren Chiu,Zhehui Huang,Lars Lindemann,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight framework called Latent Activation Editing (LAE) for improving the safety of pre-trained reinforcement learning policies in multi-quadrotor navigation without retraining or modifying weights, achieving a significant reduction in collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing infrequent but critical safety failures in reinforcement learning policies for tasks like multi-quadrotor navigation, which are costly to fix through retraining and can degrade existing skills.

Method: LAE operates in two stages: (i) an online classifier detects activations linked to undesired behaviors, (ii) an activation editing module modifies flagged activations to prompt safer policy behaviors. The system amplifies internal risk perception using a latent collision prediction model to guide cautious avoidance strategies.

Result: LAE achieves nearly a 90% reduction in cumulative collisions and significantly increases collision-free trajectories in both simulations and real-world experiments, while maintaining task completion.

Conclusion: LAE is demonstrated as an effective and hardware-feasible method for improving the safety of learned robot policies in post-deployment scenarios, broadening its potential applications in robotics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for blind legged robot locomotion, with improved adaptability and robustness shown in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots need to perform agile locomotion over unstructured terrains, which is especially challenging without prior terrain information.

Method: Developed a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework using terrain-specialized policies and curriculum learning.

Result: The method increased success rates by up to 16% in simulations, reducing tracking errors on low-friction and mixed terrains.

Conclusion: The framework enhances agility, tracking performance, and robustness for blind locomotion in complex terrains.

Abstract: Legged robots must exhibit robust and agile locomotion across diverse,
unstructured terrains, a challenge exacerbated under blind locomotion settings
where terrain information is unavailable. This work introduces a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework that leverages terrain-specialized policies
and curriculum learning to enhance agility and tracking performance in complex
environments. We validated our method on simulation, where our approach
outperforms a generalist policy by up to 16% in success rate and achieves lower

*Sun Zhaole,Xiaofeng Mao,Jihong Zhu,Yuanlong Zhang,Robert B. Fisher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the SLeap Hand, a robotic hand featuring suction-enabled dexterity, which simplifies in-hand manipulation and enables new skills beyond human capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in dexterous in-hand manipulation caused by imitating the human hand, which limits tasks and complicates data collection due to force-closure requirements.

Method: The authors design the SLeap Hand, a robotic hand with integrated fingertip suction cups, replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable single-point adhesion to simplify teleoperation and data collection.

Result: The SLeap Hand enables new robotic capabilities, including one-handed tasks such as paper cutting and writing, that are difficult or impossible for a human hand.

Conclusion: By moving beyond anthropomorphic designs, the SLeap Hand lowers barriers for data collection and broadens the scope of robotic manipulation to include tasks not achievable with traditional designs.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

*Congkai Shen,Siyuan Yu,Yifan Weng,Haoran Ma,Chen Li,Hiroshi Yasuda,James Dallas,Michael Thompson,John Subosits,Tulga Ersal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study proposes and evaluates a haptic shared control framework for training human drivers in advanced skills, where they collaborate with a semi-autonomous system under a fading assistance scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in research about skill acquisition using shared control in complex driving tasks, especially high-performance scenarios like racing and emergency obstacle avoidance.

Method: Developed a cyber racing coach framework incorporating haptic shared control with a fading assistance mechanism. Benchmarked its skill-teaching effectiveness against self-learning and full assistance methods.

Result: Human subject evaluations show the framework enables drivers to achieve superior racing skills, better performance, and improved consistency compared to the benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed haptic shared control framework effectively facilitates the acquisition of advanced driving skills, proving better than no or full-assistance training approaches.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework stabilizes EEG control using AR feedback and provides robust zero-touch robotic grasping, advancing assistive technologies and human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: Equi-RO presents a robust and accurate 4D radar odometry solution, demonstrating significant improvements in GPS-denied and adverse weather scenarios compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the

accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source
dataset.

*Wei-Teng Chu,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FINS is a lightweight framework for reconstructing surfaces and SDF fields from a single or few images. It achieves high performance and efficiency with rapid convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for implicit surface reconstruction are slow and require multi-view images, limiting their practicality. The authors aim to create a faster, more efficient solution requiring less input.

Method: FINS uses a multi-resolution hash grid encoder, lightweight geometry and color heads, and pre-trained foundation models to enable single RGB image-based reconstruction. Training is accelerated with a second-order optimizer.

Result: FINS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and speed for surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation.

Conclusion: FINS is validated for robotics tasks and scales effectively across various datasets, showcasing enhanced usability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

*Shouren Mao,Minghao Qin,Wei Dong,Huajian Liu,Yongzhuo Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS is a NAS method designed to optimize lightweight models for accuracy and latency on robot hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the gap in NAS methods insufficiently accounting for robot hardware resources and supernet training challenges.

Method: Introduces mutual distillation for subnets, DKD loss for distillation, and latency predictors for hardware-aware evolutionary search.

Result: RAM-NAS models achieve 76.7%-81.4% accuracy on ImageNet with reduced inference latency on various robot hardware.

Conclusion: RAM-NAS provides resource-aware NAS for improved performance and efficiency on robotic edge devices.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of anthropomorphic walking and stabilization mechanisms by enhancing gait models with ankles and feet.

Method: A human-inspired ankle dynamics paradigm was integrated into a forced-oscillation-based reduced-order walking model.

Result: The model stabilizes against large errors using foot placement and ankle strategies and against small perturbations with only the proprioceptive ankle scheme.

Conclusion: The addition of a human-inspired ankle design improves the gait model and offers insights into human walking stabilization mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RuN, a framework to enable humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a wide range of speeds efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable humanoid robots to achieve smooth and natural transitions between walking and running across various speeds, a complex task current methods struggle to perform effectively.

Method: RuN introduces a decoupled residual learning framework pairing a pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator for kinematic motion and a lightweight reinforcement learning policy for dynamical corrections.

Result: Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot show RuN provides stable, natural gaits and smooth transitions between walking and running speeds (0-2.5 m/s). It surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both training efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: RuN offers a robust solution for achieving efficient and natural locomotion in humanoid robots, particularly for transitioning between walking and running at various speeds.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

*Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework to optimize robot manipulator grasp poses and object trajectories from human video demonstrations under the Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in robot manipulation arising from differences in embodiment and joint constraints when learning from human video demonstrations.

Method: The proposed method focuses on object-centric learning by balancing grasp feasibility, trajectory imitation, and collision-free execution. It incorporates flow matching extended to SE(3) for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories and integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective.

Result: The approach was validated through simulation and real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks, showing its effectiveness in grasp pose and trajectory optimization.

Conclusion: JFTO is a scalable and effective framework for learning manipulation tasks from human video demonstrations, overcoming challenges related to embodiment differences and ensuring feasibility in robot behavior.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

*Reza Akhavian,Mani Amani,Johannes Mootz,Robert Ashe,Behrad Beheshti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI framework called BIM2RDT that transforms static BIM models into dynamic digital twins for safer construction site management. Key methods include integrating real-time IoT and robotic data, and a novel algorithm SG-ICP which improves data alignment accuracy through LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance digital management and prioritize safety during construction execution by bridging the gap between static BIM models and real-time conditions.

Method: The proposed BIM2RDT framework integrates data streams from BIM, IoT sensors, and robotic site data, employing the SG-ICP algorithm for point cloud registration and real-time HAV monitoring for safety.

Result: The experiments show SG-ICP significantly reduces alignment errors (64.3%--88.3%) compared to standard methods, while HAV monitoring ensures safety compliance with ISO standards through real-time alerts.

Conclusion: This framework advances construction site intelligence by improving accuracy in digital twin data alignment and enhancing worker safety through innovative integrations.

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

*Mani Amani,Reza Akhavian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that combines natural language prompts with Building Information Models (BIM) using Bayesian fusion to enhance robotic mission planning, especially in path safety and context-awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language prompts have potential in robotic mission planning, and the construction domain offers rich descriptions encapsulated in BIMs. The paper aims to leverage these resources to improve path planning for robots.

Method: The authors use a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion approach, treating a language model (LLM) as a sensor. By updating obstacle repulsive coefficients with pseudo-counts from LLM danger scores, they augment traditional potential fields for cost heuristics.

Result: Simulation results show that the proposed Bayesian fusion method leads to improved path robustness and context-aware planning, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: The framework enhances robot path planning with flexibility, safety, and context-awareness, integrating natural language commands with classical AI systems effectively.

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RobotDancing, a framework that uses reinforcement learning for robust high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoid robots, achieving zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and high-quality performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots struggle with long-duration high-dynamic motion tracking due to model-plant mismatches that cause error accumulation.

Method: RobotDancing predicts residual joint targets to handle dynamics discrepancies, uses an end-to-end reinforcement learning pipeline, and follows a unified configuration for training and transfer.

Result: The framework enables multi-minute, high-energy motion tracking (e.g., spins, jumps, cartwheels) and achieves zero-shot sim-to-real deployment with strong performance.

Conclusion: RobotDancing is effective and scalable for high-dynamic behaviors on humanoid robots, bridging the sim-to-real gap while maintaining high fidelity.

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation system for legged robots, emphasizing semantic reasoning over dense geometry, supported by hierarchical vision-language perception and probabilistic topological maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SLAM systems for legged robots struggle with rapid movement, sensor drift, and lack semantic reasoning for task-related objectives, limiting their applicability.

Method: The framework uses a vision-only method with a hierarchical vision-language perception module for semantic inference, supported by a semantic-probabilistic topological map for planning. Reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers facilitate deployment across diverse platforms.

Result: Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments show improvements in semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success. Ablation studies validate the essential components of the framework.

Conclusion: This study presents an innovative, SLAM-free navigation paradigm, shifting from traditional geometry-focused mapping to semantics-based decision-making for legged robotic exploration.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASt3R-Fusion, a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that integrates pointmap regression with data from inertial and GNSS sensors for robust 3D mapping and pose tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual SLAM systems face challenges like low-texture environments, scale ambiguity, and poor performance in challenging visual conditions. Feed-forward neural network-based methods help recover high-fidelity 3D geometry but often ignore multi-sensor fusion benefits.

Method: The proposed method tightly integrates pointmap regression with multi-sensor data (inertial, GNSS) into a Sim(3)-based SE(3) factor graph for metric-scale fusion. A hierarchical factor graph allows for real-time optimization and global consistency through loop closures.

Result: The evaluation on public benchmarks and self-collected datasets demonstrates significant accuracy and robustness improvements compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion successfully addresses common limitations in visual SLAM by combining neural networks with multi-sensor fusion. This improves robustness and accuracy for real-time tracking and mapping, with open-source code fostering future research.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) more practical for robotics by addressing the challenges of high data collection costs and inefficient exploration.

Method: MT-Lévy combines behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration strategies inspired by Lévy flight. It uses policies from related tasks to guide exploration and dynamically adjusts exploration levels based on task success rates.

Result: MT-Lévy achieved significant improvements in sample efficiency and exploration, supported by both quantitative and qualitative data. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration.

Conclusion: The proposed MT-Lévy approach effectively enhances the practicality of MTRL in robotics, demonstrating its potential to improve state-space coverage and sample efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SemSight is a method for predicting unknown areas' semantic structures in navigation tasks. It uses a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model to infer layouts, contexts, and target distributions, improving scene understanding and navigation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in navigation, current methods mainly focus on single objects or occupancy maps, lacking the capability to model room-level semantics, which is essential for better navigation and exploration.

Method: SemSight employs a probabilistic prediction model leveraging an encoder-decoder network and introduces mask-constrained supervision. It uses a dataset of 40,000 egocentric observations simulated from exploration of 2,000 indoor graphs.

Result: SemSight shows improved prediction performance for key functional categories in unexplored regions and outperforms traditional methods in Structural Consistency, Region Recognition Accuracy, and navigation efficiency in simulations.

Conclusion: SemSight advances autonomous navigation and target-driven exploration by enabling better understanding of unknown spaces, offering both functional and structural improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK), an action representation for robotic manipulation policies to improve generalizability, accuracy, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end learning models for robotic manipulation have limitations in performance, preventing large-scale practical deployment despite their advantages over modular approaches.

Method: The authors propose CoMOK, which uses an oriented keypoint action representation in a neural policy trained end-to-end to support diverse manipulation tasks, including handling multi-stage tasks, multi-modal behaviors, and deformable objects.

Result: Experiments on simulations and hardware validate CoMOK's sub-centimeter accuracy, natural generalization to varying object shapes and sizes, and effectiveness across diverse robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: CoMOK demonstrates potential as a general and reliable approach for end-to-end robotic manipulation, addressing key challenges in generalization, accuracy, and practical deployment.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for autonomous driving, specifically their fragility in real-world deployment due to hallucinations and poor generalization.

Method: Proposes MTRDrive, a closed-loop system combining memory-based experience retrieval with dynamic toolkits for improved reasoning, decision-making, and proactive behavior. Introduces a new benchmark for evaluation in complex Roadwork scenarios.

Result: MTRDrive achieves excellent performance metrics: 88.3 PDMS in NAVSIM with no chain-of-thought and sets records of 79.8% in driving metrics and 82.6% in planning accuracy. It also achieves 80.2% in unseen zero-shot Roadwork scenarios.

Conclusion: MTRDrive significantly improves autonomous driving reliability and safety, demonstrating strong generalization, decision-making, and robustness in novel challenges.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

*Xiaohan Ye,Kui Wu,Zherong Pan,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses gradient instability issues in differentiable physics caused by contact model designs and proposes a new contact model with well-behaved gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable physics is gaining importance in applications like model predictive control and robotic design, but gradient instability caused by contact models hampers its utility.

Method: The authors define essential properties for contact models to ensure stable gradients and propose a computationally efficient contact model for differentiable rigid-body simulators.

Result: The proposed contact model enabled superior performance in discovering complex control signals and solving diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Well-designed contact models with stable gradients can significantly improve the usability and performance of differentiable physics systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

*Jianbo Zhao,Taiyu Ban,Xiangjie Li,Xingtai Gui,Hangning Zhou,Lei Liu,Hongwei Zhao,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces techniques to improve autoregressive models for autonomous driving by resolving spatio-temporal misalignment and enhancing trajectory feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome limitations in autoregressive models used for autonomous driving, particularly spatio-temporal misalignment and inconsistent worldviews, which hinder their full potential.

Method: The authors propose a Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module to align environmental features consistently across time, a kinematic action prediction head to ensure feasible trajectories, and a refined post-training strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for feedback on specific driving behaviors.

Result: The model achieved state-of-the-art performance with an 89.8 PDMS score on the NAVSIM dataset, demonstrating significant advancements in autoregressive driving models.

Conclusion: Aligning temporal and spatial data properly, ensuring kinematic feasibility, and applying fine-grained feedback can elevate the performance of autoregressive models in autonomous driving.

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Motivation: The paper aims to enable mobile manipulation in unpredictable and unexplored indoor environments using natural language as input.

Method: AnywhereVLA parses user text inputs into task graphs, which condition SLAM, semantic mapping, frontier exploration, and visibility-aware approach planning. It uses a compact manipulation head fine-tuned on task-specific trajectories and runs entirely onboard consumer hardware.

Result: In evaluations, the system achieved a $46\%$ success rate in static and normal human motion environments, with real-time performance on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: Combining geometry-based navigation with language-conditioned manipulation provides both reliability and agility for task generalization, making the system effective for natural language-driven manipulation tasks in complex environments.

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a four-layer task-and-motion planning (TAMP) framework for coordinated multi-robot EV battery disassembly, leveraging various tools such as stereo vision and TP-GMM-guided motion planning, achieving increased autonomy, precision, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in multi-robot coordination for EV battery disassembly, particularly in achieving precise, safe, and reliable motion in dynamic and cluttered environments.

Method: The framework integrates symbolic task planning, cost-aware allocation, TP-GMM-guided motion learning, YOLOv8 for real-time localization, and OctoMap-based 3D mapping for collision checks. It employs two UR10e robots and a combination of planning and collision-avoidance strategies.

Result: Compared to a default RRTConnect baseline, the proposed method reduced end-effector path length by 63.3% and makespan by 8.1%, while also decreasing per-arm swept volumes and mutual overlaps significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed TAMP framework demonstrates improved safety, precision, and autonomy for EV battery disassembly in highly unstructured and dynamic environments, validating its effectiveness over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$
($0.064\rightarrow0.034\,\mathrm{m}^3$). These results highlight improved
autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes KeyWorld, a framework that accelerates robotic world model predictions by focusing computational power on key semantic frames and using lightweight interpolation for intermediate frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address inefficiencies in robotic world models caused by redundancy in frame-to-frame generation methods and the neglect of key transitions, which limit inference speed and physical plausibility.

Method: KeyWorld uses a three-step process: (1) identifying critical transitions as key frames through trajectory simplification, (2) employing a diffusion transformer (DiT) model to predict these key frames based on textual descriptions, and (3) reconstructing intermediate frames with a lightweight interpolator.

Result: KeyWorld improves inference speed by 5.68x compared to traditional methods while enhancing the physical accuracy of generated video trajectories, particularly for complex robotic tasks.

Conclusion: KeyWorld provides a feasible solution for deploying robotic world models in real-time applications, balancing efficiency and physical plausibility. This approach represents progress in making robotic systems more applicable in practice.

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a promising advance towards efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, supporting next-generation on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Normalizing Flows Policy', a novel visuomotor policy learning model, as an efficient and trustworthy alternative to diffusion models in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and lack of uncertainty quantification in current probabilistic models like diffusion models for general-purpose robotics.

Method: The authors propose a model based on Normalizing Flows that provides statistically sound confidence measures and faster inference, validated through simulated robotic tasks and ablation studies.

Result: Experiments show performance comparable to or better than diffusion models, with up to 30x faster inference and improved sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Normalizing Flows offer a viable alternative to diffusion models, ensuring both efficiency and reliability in visuomotor policy learning for robotics.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

Motivation: To enable low-cost, efficient, and lightweight environmental edge detection for drones in tasks like disaster relief and autonomous navigation.

Method: AirTouch analyzes ground effect changes through theoretical analysis, algorithms, and its drone attitude sensors, leveraging this effect for edge detection.

Result: The system achieves a mean detection distance error of 0.051m, improving accuracy by 86% over existing methods and consuming only 43 mW of power.

Conclusion: AirTouch demonstrates that utilizing the ground effect can be a practical and innovative approach for cost-effective, efficient, and lightweight drone applications.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

*William Barron,Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to teaching robots behaviors using rough annotations instead of physical motion demonstrations, employing a framework called CrossInstruct to synthesize and generalize robot actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical motion demonstrations for robot teaching are limiting and cumbersome, while alternative methods like human sketches are still inefficient and hard to scale.

Method: The paper introduces CrossInstruct, which integrates cross-modal annotations into a foundational vision-language model, creating coherent 3D motion trajectories through iterative querying of a fine-tuned model and supports reinforcement learning for task refinement.

Result: CrossInstruct generates executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond limited examples, producing effective outputs evaluated on benchmark simulations and real hardware setups.

Conclusion: CrossInstruct provides a scalable, efficient solution for robot behavior learning that reduces dependency on traditional motion demonstrations and complements reinforcement learning for task-specific behavior refinement.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: A hierarchical control framework is proposed for a drone ball-balancing task, using reinforcement learning (RL) for high-level control. It outperforms PID controllers by effectively utilizing richer state observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve control systems for complex tasks like drone ball-balancing, exploring how learning-based methods like RL can enhance performance compared to traditional controllers.

Method: A hierarchical control structure with RL for high-level decision-making and PID controllers for low-level drone stabilization. Simulation experiments evaluated and compared RL against PID controllers.

Result: RL controllers outperformed PID controllers by leveraging richer state observations. The superior performance was not due to better tuning or nonlinear capabilities, but effective state information usage.

Conclusion: Comprehensive state representation and enhanced sensing play a critical role in improving machine learning-based control systems like RL.

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-vehicle GUIs pose unique challenges due to drivers' limited attention, safety requirements, and complex interaction patterns, requiring tailored solutions.

Method: The researchers designed Automotive-ENV with 185 tasks, multimodal observations, and precise evaluation tools, alongside ASURADA, a GPS-informed agent leveraging location-based context.

Result: ASURADA performs better than traditional agents on safety-aware tasks, proving the significance of geo-aware information in automotive systems.

Conclusion: Automotive-ENV and ASURADA pave the way for developing adaptive and safety-centered multimodal in-vehicle agents, emphasizing the role of geographic context.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

*Md Faizal Karim,Vignesh Vembar,Keshab Patra,Gaurav Singh,K Madhava Krishna*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents DAGDiff, a novel method for dual-arm grasping that uses a guided diffusion process to enforce stability and collision avoidance, achieving reliable grasps on unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of dual-arm grasping is challenging due to the need for stability, collision avoidance, and the ability to generalize to different objects. Existing methods have limitations due to reliance on region priors and lack of guarantees for stability.

Method: DAGDiff employs a denoising diffusion process in the SE(3)xSE(3) space guided by classifier signals. Its guidance integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-awareness, allowing the generation of physically valid, force-closure compliant grasp pairs.

Result: The method was evaluated through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and large-scale physics simulations, showing improvements over prior approaches. Additionally, it successfully generated grasps for unseen objects from real-world point clouds.

Conclusion: DAGDiff advances dual-arm grasping by providing a more principled and reliable approach to generate stable and collision-free grasps without relying on object priors, with promising real-world applicability.

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

Motivation: Existing robot navigation systems are inefficient in large environments because they lack human-like behaviors such as interpreting signs and seeking directions.

Method: ReasonNav is a modular system using a vision-language model with compact input/output abstractions based on navigation landmarks for advanced reasoning.

Result: Tests on real and simulated navigation tasks show ReasonNav's higher-order reasoning enables efficient navigation in complex buildings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that integrating human-like reasoning via vision-language models enhances robotic navigation efficiency in large environments.

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

*Ali Kafili Gavgani,Amin Talaeizadeh,Aria Alasty,Hossein Nejat Pishkenari,Esmaeil Najafi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces omniorientational multi-rotor configurations, with additional control inputs for independent attitude and position control, validated via simulations, and compares their performance and power efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitation of under-actuated conventional multi-rotors, which cannot independently control attitude from position.

Method: The researchers introduce new configurations with additional control inputs, derive detailed dynamic models, validate them using Simscape Multibody simulations, design robust controllers (sliding mode and PID-based with gravity compensation), implement control allocation strategies, and analyze system performance via simulations.

Result: The proposed configurations achieved omniorientational capability, effective disturbance management, and power efficiency optimization, validated against simulation results.

Conclusion: The study offers valuable insights into the design of omniorientational drones, providing a framework for future research and development, tailored to specific drone design objectives.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

### [360] [SEEC: Stable End-Effector Control with Model-Enhanced Residual Learning for Humanoid Loco-Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21231)
*Jaehwi Jang,Zhuoheng Wang,Ziyi Zhou,Feiyang Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes the SEEC framework for stabilizing a humanoid robot's arm end-effector using model-enhanced residual learning, combining model-based and learning-based methods. It outperforms existing approaches in simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots require stable arm end-effector control for complex tasks, yet current methods struggle with real-world factors like friction and unseen scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces the SEEC framework, which uses model-guided reinforcement learning and a perturbation generator for precise and robust end-effector control.

Result: SEEC outperforms baseline methods in simulations and transfers successfully to the Booster T1 humanoid robot, proving its effectiveness in various loco-manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances end-effector stabilization and adapts well to unseen conditions, presenting a reliable solution for humanoid robots in real-world applications.

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

*Yutong Li,Jieyi Zhang,Wenqiang Xu,Tutian Tang,Cewu Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces FSGlove, a system that captures high-degree-of-freedom hand movements (48 DoFs) and personalized hand shapes with state-of-the-art accuracy using inertial measurement units and a novel calibration method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hand tracking systems provide limited degrees of freedom and fail to account for personal variations in hand shape, critical for accurate motion capture in robotics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Method: FSGlove uses inertial-based sensors (IMUs) on each finger joint and the dorsum. It employs DiffHCal, a differentiable optimization method, which integrates with the MANO model for simultaneous calibration of joint kinematics, hand shape, and sensor alignment.

Result: FSGlove achieves joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degrees, surpassing commercial systems in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity, enabling fine motions such as fingertip rubbing.

Conclusion: FSGlove provides an accurate and open-source solution for capturing detailed hand movements and personalized hand shapes, advancing the fields of VR, robotics, and biomechanics by bridging the gap between human dexterity and robotic imitation.

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

*Jiyeon Koo,Taewan Cho,Hyunjoon Kang,Eunseom Pyo,Tae Gyun Oh,Taeryang Kim,Andrew Jaeyong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RetoVLA, a lightweight architecture enhancing robotics spatial reasoning by reusing discarded Register Tokens, achieving significant improvement in success rates for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the efficiency-performance trade-off in Vision-Language-Action models for robotics, especially in spatial reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes reusing discarded Register Tokens from Vision Transformers by injecting them into the Action Expert module to enhance spatial reasoning in robotic tasks.

Result: Experiments with a 7-DOF robot arm showed RetoVLA improves success rates by 17.1 percentage points in complex manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Reusing Register Tokens significantly enhances spatial reasoning in robotics, revealing these previously discarded artifacts as valuable resources.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

### [363] [BiNoMaP: Learning Category-Level Bimanual Non-Prehensile Manipulation Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21256)
*Huayi Zhou,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to bimanual non-prehensile manipulation by introducing BiNoMaP and an RL-free framework to learn manipulation skills, demonstrating adaptability and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation is underexplored in robotics due to its complexity and lack of established frameworks, motivating this study to address the gap using dual-arm setups and novel learning approaches.

Method: The authors developed BiNoMaP to enable bimanual manipulation and proposed an RL-free, three-stage framework. This includes trajectory extraction from video demonstrations, post-optimization with geometry-awareness, and parameterization based on geometric attributes for category-level generalization.

Result: The BiNoMaP framework was validated across various bimanual tasks and objects, showing effectiveness, efficiency, adaptability, and enhanced generalization.

Conclusion: The study concludes that BiNoMaP enables versatile, generalizable, and efficient bimanual manipulation, marking a significant step forward in non-prehensile manipulation research.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

*Babak Salamat,Dominik Mattern,Sebastian-Sven Olzem,Gerhard Elsbacher,Christian Seidel,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a global path planning framework, GMP^3, tailored for UAVs to ensure collision-free, dynamically feasible 3D trajectories in cluttered environments. It blends reinforcement learning, cooperative updates, and real-time deployment capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in UAV trajectory planning in cluttered 3D spaces, particularly achieving dynamically feasible trajectories while integrating translational motion and rotational dynamics.

Method: A multiphase planning framework on Lie group SE(3) is introduced, leveraging modified Bellman updates for RL-based policy convergence. A distributed scheme allows agents to cooperate and refine trajectories collaboratively. Additionally, DroneManager software interfaces UAVs with the planner for real-time operation.

Result: Simulation and indoor flight tests validate the method’s success in achieving smooth collision avoidance and feasible 3D trajectories encompassing both position and orientation. Results show its effectiveness under constraints.

Conclusion: GMP^3 is a robust, cooperative path-planning solution that enhances UAV navigation in cluttered environments, supporting real-time deployment and scaling possibilities with open-source availability.

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The

*Luis Augenstein,Noémie Jaquier,Tamim Asfour,Leonel Rozo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents GPHDM, a model that incorporates hierarchical taxonomy structures and physical consistency into robot motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disconnect between robot-generated motions and biomechanically inspired hierarchical motion taxonomies in prior work.

Method: The model extends the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to operate in a hyperbolic manifold, incorporating taxonomy-aware inductive biases, and proposes three new motion generation mechanisms.

Result: Experiments on hand grasping taxonomy showed that GPHDM accurately captures hierarchical taxonomy and temporal dynamics, generating physically-realistic motions.

Conclusion: GPHDM advances motion generation by preserving the structure and dynamics of human-like motions, offering a taxonomy-aware and physically-consistent approach to robotic movement.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACCeLLiuM introduces LLMs fine-tuned to generate expert OpenACC directives for GPU programming, outperforming base models considerably.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to simplify generating accurate OpenACC directives for GPU programming, addressing both accessibility and expertise challenges.

Method: ACCeLLiuM fine-tunes Large Language Models using a dataset of OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from GitHub repositories.

Result: Fine-tuned models generated valid OpenACC pragmas for 87% of data-parallel loops and achieved exact matches for 50% of cases.

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM advances automated GPU parallelization, provides reproducible benchmarks, and lowers programming barriers via public release of resources.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the ineffectiveness of traditional text-based and numerical methods by providing a systematic analysis of visualization tools.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic review of over 60 key research papers to categorize visualization techniques and analyze advancements and challenges.

Result: The analysis identified four key visualization categories: graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualizations. It highlighted extensive software development and operational cybersecurity visualization as main focus areas.

Conclusion: There is a need for innovative visualization methods to handle evolving security threats, with potential to improve threat detection and response strategies.

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

Motivation: The need to address challenges in tool selection for environments with hundreds or thousands of tools without exceeding computational feasibility.

Method: Implementation and evaluation of five architectures that refine tool selection, enabling search-and-load mechanisms for intelligent tool usage.

Result: The approach achieves up to 50% reduction in tool-loading computational overhead while preserving task accuracy.

Conclusion: Dynamic ReAct advances the adaptability of AI agents in diverse environments, pushing towards general-purpose AI solutions.

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments

culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Improperly designed software might discriminate due to flaws in algorithm or biased data. This paper suggests employing knowledge graphs to specify and verify fairness requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrimination in software decisions often arises from the lack of well-specified fairness requirements. Current mechanisms are poorly equipped to formalize fairness knowledge.

Method: The authors propose developing a knowledge graph-based framework to formalize fairness knowledge, inspired by its successful application in fields like security engineering.

Result: Challenges, research questions, and a roadmap for creating the knowledge graph-based framework are outlined.

Conclusion: Knowledge graphs can potentially assist in defining and verifying fairness requirements in software, mitigating discrimination risks.

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between traditional coding tools or AI-driven code assistants and educational tools that foster learning and conceptual understanding in programming.

Method: The chatbot uses a hybrid architecture involving CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interaction, and Docker for secure code execution. It integrates static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs).

Result: The system achieved an 85% error resolution success rate, reduced debugging time by 59.3%, and improved coding proficiency by 34%. Student feedback highlighted its clarity and confidence-building capabilities but pointed out some latency and restrictive sanitization.

Conclusion: The chatbot demonstrates the potential of AI tools in enhancing programming education by integrating technical solutions with pedagogical goals, providing a model for tools emphasizing learning and long-term skill development.

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online-Optimized RAG, a framework for adaptive embedding optimization at deployment time, addressing misalignment issues in retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve embedding misalignment issues that arise from imperfect models or noisy descriptions, which can lead to incorrect retrieval and task failures in RAG systems.

Method: The framework adapts retrieval embeddings using lightweight online gradient updates based on live feedback while maintaining negligible latency. It requires no modifications to the underlying LLM and supports various tool-use configurations.

Result: Online-Optimized RAG improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success across diverse scenarios, consistently enhancing performance in practical applications.

Conclusion: This plug-and-play framework offers a robust solution for self-improving RAG systems, enabling continual optimization and ensuring high reliability in tool use and retrieval tasks.

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for enforceable and formally verified legal contracts, especially concerning asset transfers and obligations.

Method: It translates Stipula contracts into Java code annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications and verifies their correctness using KeY, focusing on contracts with disjoint cycles.

Result: The proposed methodology successfully achieves automatic verification of partial and total correctness for many types of Stipula contracts.

Conclusion: The study confirms that general-purpose deductive verification tools can effectively verify Stipula legal contracts via translation approaches.

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

*Brahim Mahmoudi,Naouel Moha,Quentin Stievenert,Florent Avellaneda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SpecDetect4AI is a tool designed to identify AI-specific code smells using a rule-based system, achieving high precision and recall in large-scale testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems present unique code issues such as reproducibility and generalization problems that current tools fail to address, necessitating a solution for detecting AI-specific code smells.

Method: SpecDetect4AI uses a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule specification and an extensible static analysis tool, enabling the detection of 22 AI-specific code smells.

Result: The tool was evaluated on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code) with precision of 88.66%, recall of 88.89%, and an SUS score of 81.7/100.

Conclusion: SpecDetect4AI demonstrates effective, scalable, and extensible performance in identifying AI-specific code smells, outperforming existing tools.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

### [374] [PromptDebt: A Comprehensive Study of Technical Debt Across LLM Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20497)
*Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines the self-admitted technical debt (SATD) arising from integrating large language models (LLMs) into software, focusing on their origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the technical debt introduced by the integration of LLMs into software systems, which is increasingly common and carries unique challenges.

Method: The authors conducted a large-scale empirical study analyzing 93,142 Python files across major LLM APIs to identify and categorize instances of SATD.

Result: The analysis revealed that 54.49% of SATD instances are associated with OpenAI integrations, 12.35% with LangChain use, and prompt design is the leading source of debt. Instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly problematic.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better strategies to manage LLM-related SATD and provides a dataset to facilitate future research and practical guidance for developers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

### [375] [Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552)
*Xinyu Shi,Zhenhao Li,An Ran Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaR-Loc integrates large language models with retrieval-augmented generation to improve fault localization in software debugging, outperforming state-of-the-art models in accuracy without re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle in fault localization due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and challenges with navigating large software systems.

Method: The FaR-Loc framework consists of three components: (1) LLM Functionality Extraction to generate concise descriptions of failing behavior, (2) Semantic Dense Retrieval using pre-trained code-understanding encoders to identify functionally similar methods, and (3) LLM Re-ranking for context-based method prioritization.

Result: FaR-Loc significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., SoapFL, AutoFL) on accuracy metrics (Top-1, Top-5) and also achieves better results than learning-based and spectrum-based baselines.

Conclusion: FaR-Loc is a practical and effective solution for method-level fault localization, benefiting significantly from integrating pre-trained code embedding models that consider code structure.

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

### [377] [Exploring Engagement in Hybrid Meetings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20780)
*Daniela Grassi,Fabio Calefato,Darja Smite,Nicole Novielli,Filippo Lanubile*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper examines engagement patterns in hybrid meetings at software companies, finding similar engagement levels between remote and onsite participants but highlighting factors like meeting length and active roles affecting engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of engagement, communication, and collaboration in hybrid meeting environments, especially as hybrid work becomes the norm.

Method: A multimodal approach using self-reported questionnaires and biometric data from professionals across three software companies during hybrid meetings over several weeks.

Result: Regression analyses show comparable engagement for both co-located and remote participants, but remote participants were less engaged in longer meetings. Active roles improved engagement, while larger meetings and afternoon sessions reduced it.

Conclusion: Findings provide actionable insights into engagement dynamics and offer improvement strategies for hybrid meetings, relevant to software companies and knowledge-intensive sectors.

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

### [378] [Verification Limits Code LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20837)
*Srishti Gureja,Elena Tommasone,Jingyi He,Sara Hooker,Matthias Gallé,Marzieh Fadaee*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper identifies a limitation called the "verification ceiling" in code generation with synthetic verification and proposes methods to improve model performance via relaxed verification criteria and leveraging diverse, challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations in synthetic data generation for code models, specifically focusing on how reliance on synthetic verifiers constrains the diversity and quality of training data.

Method: The study investigates various aspects of verification: the complexity/quantity of test cases, the use of relaxed pass thresholds, and the importance of retaining diverse correct solutions. Controlled comparisons and experiments are used to assess the impacts of these variables.

Result: The researchers found that richer test suites improved pass@1 performance by +3, relaxing pass criteria added 2-4 points in performance, and that retaining diverse correct solutions yielded consistent generalization improvements. Overly rigid verification was found to restrict valuable diversity.

Conclusion: Verification remains essential but needs recalibration. By using more diverse, complex test cases and adjusted verification thresholds, stronger code generation models can be achieved, overcoming the verification ceiling limitation.

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

### [379] [PseudoBridge: Pseudo Code as the Bridge for Better Semantic and Logic Alignment in Code Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20881)
*Yixuan Li,Xinyi Liu,Weidong Yang,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Mingjie Zhou,Lipeng Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PseudoBridge, a framework using pseudo-code to bridge the gap between natural language and code, substantially enhances code search accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code search is hindered by semantic gaps between natural language descriptions and structured programming logic, alongside robustness issues related to code style variations.

Method: PseudoBridge introduces an intermediate pseudo-code modality using a large language model (LLM) and a logic-invariant style augmentation strategy for alignment and robustness.

Result: PseudoBridge consistently outperformed 10 PLM baselines across 6 programming languages, delivering notable improvements in retrieval accuracy, especially in zero-shot domain transfer scenarios.

Conclusion: PseudoBridge proves effective in bridging natural language and code logic, offering a promising solution for robust and generalizable code retrieval frameworks.

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

*Oka Kurniawan,Erick Chandra,Christopher M. Poskitt,Yannic Noller,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Cyrille Jegourel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeHinter, an AI-assisted debugging tool that blends traditional debugging tools with large language model techniques to help novice programmers fix semantic errors actively without over-relying on AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of novice programmers struggling with debugging while avoiding over-reliance on AI-driven tools by fostering active engagement in the process.

Method: The authors designed CodeHinter, an intuitive debugging assistant that integrates traditional debugging tools with LLM-based techniques to support novice programmers. It was tested with undergraduate students in its second iteration.

Result: The tool was found to be highly effective in fixing semantic errors and easier to use than its previous version. Error localization was highlighted as its most valuable feature.

Conclusion: AI-assisted debugging tools like CodeHinter should be tailored to specific user profiles to enhance engagement and interaction, ensuring optimal effectiveness for students.

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

*Nek Dil Khan,Javed Ali Khan,Mobashir Husain,Muhammad Sohail Khan,Arif Ali Khan,Muhammad Azeem Akbar,Shahid Hussain*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study categorized quantum development challenges by analyzing 2829 posts using advanced AI algorithms, achieving 95% accuracy with transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum developers struggle with quantum computing optimization and seek answers on forums like Stack Overflow. Identifying common challenges can help streamline development and improve community support.

Method: The authors extracted quantum-tagged posts, annotated challenges using grounded theory, validated annotations with ChatGPT, and fine-tuned transformer models like BERT to classify discussions.

Result: Transformer-based models achieved 95% accuracy in segmenting challenges, outperforming D&ML-based models that scored 89%, 86%, and 84%. Insights for transparency were improved using SHAP.

Conclusion: Transformer algorithms significantly enhance challenge classification, aiding vendors and forums in better structuring information for quantum developers. Additional empirical studies are needed for direct developer input.

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

*Yongda Yu,Guohao Shi,Xianwei Wu,Haochuan He,XueMing Gu,Qianqian Zhao,Kui Liu,Qiushi Wang,Zhao Tian,Haifeng Shen,Guoping Rong*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MelcotCR introduces a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning method for large language models (LLMs) aimed at improving automatic code review capabilities. The approach significantly enhances reasoning and issue identification accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle to match human-level analysis during code reviews as they lack the ability to reason across multiple dimensions effectively. Fine-tuning methods have shown promising improvements, but they do not fully utilize structured and rich reasoning data.

Method: The paper proposes MelcotCR, which utilizes long chain-of-thought techniques combined with the Maximum Entropy modeling principle and predefined reasoning pathways to enhance the reasoning process. This method provides structured information while mitigating context and logical reasoning loss during long prompts.

Result: MelcotCR fine-tuned on the MelcotCR and CodeReviewer datasets demonstrated superior performance in code issue detection and description accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving results comparable to a much larger, high-parameter model (671B DeepSeek-R1).

Conclusion: MelcotCR showcases the potential for advanced fine-tuning strategies in boosting LLM performance in automated code review, achieving accuracy near human-level reasoning with fewer parameters, marking a significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of utilizing citizen input on digital platforms by proposing a methodology that integrates BERTopic, seed words, and automatic validation through large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governments face difficulties in processing and utilizing the vast amount of citizen input on participatory platforms like Brasil Participativo effectively.

Method: The authors utilized BERTopic fueled with seed words and automated validation by large language models to classify and align citizen contributions with official taxonomies.

Result: Initial results show that the proposed approach produces coherent and institutionally aligned topics with minimal human intervention.

Conclusion: This methodology enables governments to efficiently process and transform extensive citizen contributions into actionable insights for public policy creation.

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.

*Matthew King-Hang Ma,Manson Cheuk-Man Fong,Yun Feng,Cloris Pui-Hang Li,William Shiyuan Wang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study analyzes EEG data of cognitively normal older adults to reveal that subjective cognitive concerns correlate with weaker brain activity in processing linguistic features, especially during less engaging speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how subjective cognitive concerns reflect neural dynamics during speech perception could help identify early signs of cognitive decline.

Method: The study recorded EEG data from 56 older adults aged 60-70 while they listened to stimuli with varying speech prosody. Encoding models predicted EEG signals based on acoustic, segmentation, and phonotactic features.

Result: Greater subjective concern correlated with weaker cortical tracking of higher-level linguistic features and less engaging stimuli but did not affect responses to prosodically rich speech or acoustic features.

Conclusion: Cortical tracking during speech perception could act as an indicator of early cognitive impairment, especially in response to prosodically flat speech.

Abstract: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) approximately doubles the risk of
progressing to MCI and dementia. The present study investigates how one's
subjective concerns of his/her own cognition are manifested in the neural
dynamics during speech perception. EEG was collected from 56 Cantonese,
cognitively normal older adults (aged 60 - 70) while they listened to stimuli
of four expressive styles that varied in prosody: scrambled, descriptive,
dialogue, and exciting. Using encoding models to predict EEG signals from
acoustic, segmentation, and phonotactic features, we found that greater
subjective concern was associated with weaker cortical tracking of (1)
higher-level linguistic features but not acoustic features and (2) less
engaging stimuli (scrambled and descriptive styles) but not prosodically rich
stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that early signs of cognitive impairment
can be revealed from speech perception via cortical tracking, especially while
listening to prosodically flat speech.

Motivation: To understand and leverage structured correlations in data under randomness and explain the success of Netflix Prize competition algorithms.

Method: The authors use $VCN_{k,k}$-dimension, derived from Shelah's classification theory, to characterize the learnability of their proposed model.

Result: The study offers a comprehensive framework connecting learnability in high-dimensional settings to the model's theoretical underpinnings.

Conclusion: The new model provides a theoretical basis for the effectiveness of specific algorithms under structured random dependencies, as seen in the Netflix Prize competition.

Abstract: We develop a new high-dimensional statistical learning model which can take
advantage of structured correlation in data even in the presence of randomness.
We completely characterize learnability in this model in terms of
VCN${}_{k,k}$-dimension (essentially $k$-dependence from Shelah's

*Khai Nguyen,Hai Nguyen,Nhat Ho*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to efficiently compute Wasserstein distances by regressing them on sliced Wasserstein distances, using linear models for faster predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency and computational expense of calculating Wasserstein distances for multiple distribution pairs.

Method: They utilize linear regression models leveraging sliced Wasserstein distances (lower bounds) and lifted sliced Wasserstein distances (upper bounds) to estimate true Wasserstein distances efficiently.

Result: The proposed method achieved better Wasserstein distance approximations compared to the state-of-the-art models, especially under low-data scenarios, across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the accuracy and computational efficiency of Wasserstein distance estimation, with applications in distribution visualization, classification, and accelerating training for other models (e.g., RG-Wormhole).

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for
multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we
propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on
sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW
distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide
upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure
parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a
closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half
as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small
number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the
Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of
SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach
on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and
Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets
such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our
method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance
than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole,
particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator
can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.

*Chao Ying,Jun Jin,Haotian Zhang,Qinglong Tian,Yanyuan Ma,Yixuan Li,Jiwei Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses a complex unsupervised domain adaptation problem involving structured missing subpopulations and proposes methods to recover predictions while outperforming naive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of missing subpopulation data in unsupervised domain adaptation, which can lead to biased estimates and poor predictive performance.

Method: The authors develop theoretical prediction models for the target domain, introduce a distribution matching method to estimate subpopulation proportions, and provide theoretical guarantees for the model's asymptotics and prediction error bounds.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior predictive accuracy compared to naive benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: It is possible to effectively recover target domain predictions even with unobservable subpopulations in the source domain, using the proposed theoretical and methodological framework.

Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain
consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary
background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one
such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this
unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive
performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction
in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive
both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain.
For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to
estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for
the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the
prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show
that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this
unobservable source subpopulation.

### [388] [A Gapped Scale-Sensitive Dimension and Lower Bounds for Offset Rademacher Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20618)
*Zeyu Jia,Yury Polyanskiy,Alexander Rakhlin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper investigates 'gapped scale-sensitive dimensions' to control covering numbers and establish lower bounds on learning convergence rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize existing results on covering numbers and enhance methods for determining lower bounds on learning rates.

Method: Study the concept of 'gapped scale-sensitive dimensions' for sequential and non-sequential scenarios and analyze their impact on controlling covering numbers and Rademacher averages.

Result: The gapped dimensions effectively control covering numbers and lead to stronger lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages.

Conclusion: The study of gapped dimensions extends previous results and provides improved tools for analyzing convergence in statistical and online learning.

Abstract: We study gapped scale-sensitive dimensions of a function class in both
sequential and non-sequential settings. We demonstrate that covering numbers
for any uniformly bounded class are controlled above by these gapped
dimensions, generalizing the results of
\cite{anthony2000function,alon1997scale}. Moreover, we show that the gapped
dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby
strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of
convergence in statistical and online learning.

*Joaquim Valerio Teixeira,Ed Reznik,Sudpito Banerjee,Wesley Tansey*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian framework to improve spatial signal recovery in biological imaging data. It leverages sparsity and a hierarchical variational method for better inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of mixed molecular signals in single pixels of biological imaging technologies, such as IMS and IMC, which complicate data analysis.

Method: The method involves a Bayesian framework that uses a heavy-tailed graphical lasso prior and a novel hierarchical variational family, with efficient inference performed via automatic differentiation variational inference.

Result: Simulations indicate superior performance compared to existing IMS methods. On real IMS data, the method better identifies anatomical structures, removes artifacts, and reveals regions overlooked by traditional analyses.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework enhances the recovery of molecular signals, improves anatomical clarity, and outperforms existing methodologies in both simulated and real IMS data.

Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as
imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging
because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from
molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian
framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover
relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on
the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel
hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic
differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS,
and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference
techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better
recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and
detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.

*Wandi Xu,Wei Xie*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAPTOR-GEN, a Bayesian learning framework to enable faster digital twin development in biopharmaceutical manufacturing from sparse and varied data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of agility and adaptability in biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes due to their inherent complexity and variability.

Method: RAPTOR-GEN leverages a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph based on stochastic differential equations, integrating a linear noise approximation metamodel and a sequential learning strategy.

Result: Numerical experiments validated RAPTOR-GEN's effectiveness in uncovering biomanufacturing regulatory mechanisms.

Conclusion: RAPTOR-GEN successfully provides a robust and efficient mechanism for learning mechanistic parameters with performance guarantees, advancing digital twin applications in biopharmaceutical production.

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the
agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the
complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce
RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning
framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from
sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a
multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic
differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the
nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i)
an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that
exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a
sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling
inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the
intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior
sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior
exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It
generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size
selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable
finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN
algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of
biomanufacturing processes.

### [391] [Conditionally Whitened Generative Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20928)
*Yanfeng Yang,Siwei Chen,Pingping Hu,Zhaotong Shen,Yingjie Zhang,Zhuoran Sun,Shuai Li,Ziqi Chen,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), which use prior information like conditional means and covariances for improved multivariate time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts in multivariate time series forecasting.

Method: Develop a framework called CW-Gen with Conditional Whitening, introducing a Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE), and extending to specific models like CW-Diff and CW-Flow.

Result: CW-Gen improves predictive performance, effectively modeling non-stationary dynamics, inter-variable correlations, and mitigating distribution shifts in experiments with five real-world datasets and six generative models.

Conclusion: Incorporating prior information like conditional means and covariances in generative models improves the modeling of complex time-series data and handles distribution shifts effectively.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to
non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While
recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore
informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we
propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that
incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we
establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal
distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with
a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the
conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this
analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that
simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance.
Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models
(CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow).
Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative
models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance,
capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more
effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate
that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.

### [392] [Empirical PAC-Bayes bounds for Markov chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20985)
*Vahe Karagulyan,Pierre Alquier*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains using the pseudo-spectral gap, which can be empirically estimated for finite state spaces, enabling fully empirical bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generalization theory for dependent data, specifically Markov chains, and provide scalable empirical methods to improve PAC-Bayes bound formulations.

Method: Develop a PAC-Bayes bound dependent on the pseudo-spectral gap, and demonstrate that this gap can be empirically estimated for finite state spaces. Extend results to non-finite cases with additional assumptions.

Result: The study provides the first empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains, showing the empirical bounds are comparably tight to theoretical counterparts in simulated experiments.

Conclusion: The work advances PAC-Bayes theory by enabling empirical bounds for Markov chains using pseudo-spectral gap analysis, offering practical insights for dependent data.

Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations.
Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal
dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on
properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time,
spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove
a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity
called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an
empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite.
Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains.
This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional
assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is
essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.

### [393] [Best-of-$\infty$ -- Asymptotic Performance of Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21091)
*Junpei Komiyama,Daisuke Oba,Masafumi Oyamada*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) using best-of-$N$ with majority voting, exploring the Best-of-$\infty$ limit, adaptive computation, and weighted ensemble strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the performance and efficiency of LLMs during inference without requiring infinite computation.

Method: The authors propose an adaptive generation scheme based on agreement among outputs and extend this to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs using mixed-integer linear programming.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adaptive and weighted ensemble techniques improve LLM performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques, including adaptive computation and weighted ensembles, enable better LLM results than individual models or inefficient Best-of-$\infty$ approaches.

Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is
based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$,
which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive
performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address
this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer
agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond
adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs,
showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal
ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer
linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach.

### [394] [WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21160)
*Soham Bonnerjee,Sayar Karmakar,Subhrajyoty Roy*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents WISER, an algorithm for watermark segmentation in texts, addressing computational efficiency and accuracy gaps of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for distinguishing watermarked segments in mixed-source texts, a problem less explored compared to overall watermark detection.

Method: The authors propose a novel watermark segmentation approach, WISER, inspired by epidemic change-point detection, supported by theoretical error bounds and validated through experiments.

Result: WISER surpasses baseline methods in computational efficiency and accuracy across diverse watermarking schemes, as shown through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: WISER is an effective and theoretically grounded algorithm for watermark localization, drawing insights from statistical change-point problems for a contemporary issue.

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over
content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking
schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an
appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The
corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical
hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research
in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which
segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less
explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical
guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a
unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of
epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences
of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally
efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our
algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its
consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text.
Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments
show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of
computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded
with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings
establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most
settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can
lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a
modern and pertinent problem.

### [395] [Breaking the curse of dimensionality for linear rules: optimal predictors over the ellipsoid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21174)
*Alexis Ayme,Bruno Loureiro*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies minimal structural assumptions needed to prevent statistical learning degradation in high dimensions, focusing on linear prediction rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what structural constraints can mitigate the curse of dimensionality in statistical learning settings.

Method: The study establishes non-asymptotic bounds on generalization error for linear predictors under certain Bayes predictor structural constraints. It also derives specific lower bounds for a subclass of rotationally invariant linear predictors.

Result: Findings identify two key contributors to risk in high dimensions: an intrinsic dimensionality variance-like term and a high-dimensional noiseless error term.

Conclusion: Structural assumptions play a critical role in alleviating high-dimensional challenges in generalization error, as shown by bounds analysis for linear predictors.

Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural
assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning
bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the
classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear
observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the
generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed
as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X)
Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules --
encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators,
including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our
contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower
bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the
Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower
bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when
the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental
contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic
dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises
specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the
role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

*Andrew Gordon Wilson,Zhiting Hu,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Eric P. Xing*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper challenges the notion that Gaussian process kernel hyperparameters are primarily influenced by complexity penalties, showing instead that data-fit balance also significantly affects kernel hyperparameter determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify a misunderstanding in Gaussian process kernel hyperparameter tuning stated in "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning".

Method: The paper re-examines the mathematical framework of Gaussian processes, focusing on how reparametrizations interact with data-fit terms and kernel hyperparameters.

Result: Finds that the reparametrization introduces another data-fit term which jointly influences kernel hyperparameters alongside the complexity penalty.

Conclusion: Both data-fit and complexity penalties retain a significant role in Gaussian process kernel hyperparameter selection, contrary to prior claims.

Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober
et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be
compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al.
(2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance
coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of
this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use
this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the
kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel
hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show
that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which
influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit
and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel
hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the behavior of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) systems when faced with memory faults and evaluates mitigation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the gap in understanding the reliability and fault tolerance of FHE systems, which are critical for privacy-sensitive computations.

Method: The paper examines the impact of memory faults on FHE computation by studying individual operations and applications across different FHE schemes, and evaluates both traditional and FHE-specific fault mitigation techniques.

Result: The analysis provides insights into how FHE systems react under memory faults and evaluates the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to enhancing the reliability of FHE systems and inform better fault resilience for encrypted computation platforms.

Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) represents a paradigm shift in
cryptography, enabling computation directly on encrypted data and unlocking
privacy-critical computation. Despite being increasingly deployed in real
platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond
to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of
how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of
individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different
FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific
fault mitigation techniques are.

*Jiayi Lin,Liangcai Su,Junzhe Li,Chenxiong Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: R1-Fuzz leverages RL to optimize and integrate cost-efficient language models for fuzzing complex software targets, achieving high coverage and discovering new vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuzzing tools struggle to handle complex programs like compilers and database engines due to intricate input constraints; language models show potential, but adoption is limited due to challenges with deep program exploration and high costs.

Method: Introduced R1-Fuzz, which uses reinforcement learning with novel coverage and reward strategies for post-training and integrates LMs to generate semantically valid textual inputs for fuzzing.

Result: R1-Fuzz-7B model outperformed larger models, achieving up to 75% higher software coverage on real-world targets and uncovering 29 new vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: R1-Fuzz demonstrates that RL-based optimization of smaller language models is effective for practical and efficient fuzzing of complex systems.

Abstract: Fuzzing is effective for vulnerability discovery but struggles with complex
targets such as compilers, interpreters, and database engines, which accept
textual input that must satisfy intricate syntactic and semantic constraints.
Although language models (LMs) have attracted interest for this task due to
their vast latent knowledge and reasoning potential, their practical adoption
has been limited. The major challenges stem from insufficient exploration of
deep program logic among real-world codebases, and the high cost of leveraging
larger models. To overcome these challenges, we propose R1-Fuzz, the first
framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to specialize
cost-efficient LMs and integrate them for complex textual fuzzing input
generation. R1-Fuzz introduces two key designs: coverage-slicing-based question
construction and a distance-based reward calculation. Through RL-based
post-training of a model with our constructed dataset, R1-Fuzz designs a
fuzzing workflow that tightly integrates LMs to reason deep program semantics
during fuzzing. Evaluations on diverse real-world targets show that our design
enables a small model, named R1-Fuzz-7B, to rival or even outperform much
larger models in real-world fuzzing. Notably, R1-Fuzz achieves up to 75\%
higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzers and discovers 29 previously
unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of balancing security and performance in satellite constellations through automated security management.

Method: The authors examine three AI architectures: centralized, distributed, and federated, for their suitability in automated security management across varying timelines.

Result: Centralized architectures are deemed suitable for short-term applications, offering fast training but encountering communication latency issues. Decentralized architectures are better long-term solutions due to scalability and enhanced security.

Conclusion: A centralized approach is effective for short-term goals, while decentralized architectures are preferred for long-term benefits in satellite security management.

Abstract: This paper investigates the trade-off between centralized and decentralized
security management in constellations of satellites to balance security and
performance. We highlight three key AI architectures for automated security
management: (a) centralized, (b) distributed and (c) federated. The centralized
architecture is the best option short term, providing fast training, despite
the hard challenge of the communication latency overhead across space.
Decentralized architectures are better alternatives in the longer term,

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoMalTool, a framework for automatically testing vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents through malicious tool generation, exposing significant security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The focus is on addressing the lack of systematic and automated ways to test the vulnerability of LLM-based agents to tool poisoning attacks.

Method: The authors created AutoMalTool, an automated framework that generates malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to study their impact on LLM-based agents.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated that many LLM-based agents are susceptible to manipulation through malicious MCP tools while evading existing detection methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the security risks in LLM-based agents, emphasizing the need for improved safeguards against MCP tool poisoning attacks.

Abstract: The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) has led to the wide
application of LLM-based agents in various domains. To standardize interactions
between LLM-based agents and their environments, model context protocol (MCP)
tools have become the de facto standard and are now widely integrated into
these agents. However, the incorporation of MCP tools introduces the risk of
tool poisoning attacks, which can manipulate the behavior of LLM-based agents.
Although previous studies have identified such vulnerabilities, their red
teaming approaches have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, leaving
the automatic and systematic red teaming of LLM-based agents under the MCP tool
poisoning paradigm an open question. To bridge this gap, we propose
AutoMalTool, an automated red teaming framework for LLM-based agents by
generating malicious MCP tools. Our extensive evaluation shows that AutoMalTool
effectively generates malicious MCP tools capable of manipulating the behavior
of mainstream LLM-based agents while evading current detection mechanisms,
thereby revealing new security risks in these agents.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new defense mechanism (MARS) to protect Federated Learning systems from state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of Federated Learning systems to advanced backdoor attacks like 3DFed and the ineffectiveness of current defenses motivated this work.

Method: Introducing Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS), which uses backdoor energy (BE) as an indicator of neuron malignity, concentrated backdoor energy (CBE) for amplification, and a novel Wasserstein distance-based clustering method for identifying malicious models.

Result: MARS successfully defends against SOTA backdoor attacks, significantly surpassing existing defense methods.

Conclusion: The proposed defense mechanism (MARS) offers an effective and advanced solution against backdoor attacks in Federated Learning, leveraging novel metrics and clustering techniques.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed paradigm aimed at protecting
participant data privacy by exchanging model parameters to achieve high-quality
model training. However, this distributed nature also makes FL highly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Notably, the recently proposed state-of-the-art
(SOTA) attack, 3DFed (SP2023), uses an indicator mechanism to determine whether
the backdoor models have been accepted by the defender and adaptively optimizes
backdoor models, rendering existing defenses ineffective. In this paper, we
first reveal that the failure of existing defenses lies in the employment of
empirical statistical measures that are loosely coupled with backdoor attacks.
Motivated by this, we propose a Malignity-Aware backdooR defenSe (MARS) that
leverages backdoor energy (BE) to indicate the malicious extent of each neuron.
To amplify malignity, we further extract the most prominent BE values from each
model to form a concentrated backdoor energy (CBE). Finally, a novel
Wasserstein distance-based clustering method is introduced to effectively
identify backdoor models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS can
defend against SOTA backdoor attacks and significantly outperforms existing
defenses.

Method: Developed an expert-validated privacy scorecard to analyze documents from AI coding assistant services and scored them based on 14 criteria.

Result: Found a 20-point gap in privacy practices among major tools, highlighted industry weaknesses like opt-out consent for training and lack of proactive filtering for secrets.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for transparency, proposing more user-centric privacy standards and guidance for tool selection.

Abstract: The rapid integration of AI-powered coding assistants into developer
workflows has raised significant privacy and trust concerns. As developers
entrust proprietary code to services like OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, and
GitHub Copilot, the unclear data handling practices of these tools create
security and compliance risks. This paper addresses this challenge by
introducing and applying a novel, expert-validated privacy scorecard. The
methodology involves a detailed analysis of four document types; from legal
policies to external audits; to score five leading assistants against 14
weighted criteria. A legal expert and a data protection officer refined these
criteria and their weighting. The results reveal a distinct hierarchy of
privacy protections, with a 20-point gap between the highest- and lowest-ranked
tools. The analysis uncovers common industry weaknesses, including the
pervasive use of opt-out consent for model training and a near-universal
failure to filter secrets from user prompts proactively. The resulting
scorecard provides actionable guidance for developers and organizations,
enabling evidence-based tool selection. This work establishes a new benchmark
for transparency and advocates for a shift towards more user-centric privacy
standards in the AI industry.

### [404] [Defending against Stegomalware in Deep Neural Networks with Permutation Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20399)
*Birk Torpmann-Hagen,Michael A. Riegler,Pål Halvorsen,Dag Johansen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses the threat of neural network stegomalware by proposing and demonstrating a countermeasure that neutralizes malware embedded in model checkpoints effectively and without harming model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the largely overlooked security risk posed by neural network stegomalware, where malicious software can be hidden in model checkpoints and distributed through shared platforms.

Method: The paper introduces a technique that neutralizes malicious payloads embedded in neural network checkpoints by shuffling matrix columns or convolutional layer channels. This neutralizes the malware without affecting the model's accuracy.

Result: The proposed method effectively disrupts state-of-the-art stegomalware embedding techniques at no cost to network accuracy and shows superior performance compared to existing countermeasures.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their approach is a significant advancement for securing deep learning models and emphasize the need for further research in this domain to develop comprehensive machine learning security solutions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are being utilized in a growing number of applications,
both in production systems and for personal use. Network checkpoints are as a
consequence often shared and distributed on various platforms to ease the
development process. This work considers the threat of neural network
stegomalware, where malware is embedded in neural network checkpoints at a
negligible cost to network accuracy. This constitutes a significant security
concern, but is nevertheless largely neglected by the deep learning
practitioners and security specialists alike. We propose the first effective
countermeasure to these attacks. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art
neural network stegomalware can be efficiently and effectively neutralized
through shuffling the column order of the weight- and bias-matrices, or
equivalently the channel-order of convolutional layers. We show that this
effectively corrupts payloads that have been embedded by state-of-the-art
methods in neural network steganography at no cost to network accuracy,
outperforming competing methods by a significant margin. We then discuss
possible means by which to bypass this defense, additional defense methods, and
advocate for continued research into the security of machine learning systems.

*Tharcisse Ndayipfukamiye,Jianguo Ding,Doreen Sebastian Sarwatt,Adamu Gaston Philipo,Huansheng Ning*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This survey reviews the use of GANs in cybersecurity defenses, identifies advancements and challenges, and proposes future directions for improved deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of machine learning systems to adversarial attacks and explore the use of GANs as both threats and defenses in cybersecurity applications.

Method: A systematic literature review using PRISMA guidelines was performed across five major digital libraries. 185 peer-reviewed papers were analyzed and categorized through a four-dimensional taxonomy.

Result: GANs enhanced detection accuracy, robustness, and data utility in fields like intrusion detection and IoT security. Advances include WGAN-GP for stable training and hybrid models for resilience.

Conclusion: GAN-based defenses exhibit promise but face challenges like training instability and high costs. Future efforts should focus on stable architectures, benchmarking, explainability, and real-world integration.

Abstract: Machine learning-based cybersecurity systems are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) act as both
powerful attack enablers and promising defenses. This survey systematically
reviews GAN-based adversarial defenses in cybersecurity (2021--August 31,
2025), consolidating recent progress, identifying gaps, and outlining future
directions. Using a PRISMA-compliant systematic literature review protocol, we
searched five major digital libraries. From 829 initial records, 185
peer-reviewed studies were retained and synthesized through quantitative trend
analysis and thematic taxonomy development. We introduce a four-dimensional
taxonomy spanning defensive function, GAN architecture, cybersecurity domain,
and adversarial threat model. GANs improve detection accuracy, robustness, and
data utility across network intrusion detection, malware analysis, and IoT
security. Notable advances include WGAN-GP for stable training, CGANs for
targeted synthesis, and hybrid GAN models for improved resilience. Yet,
persistent challenges remain such as instability in training, lack of
standardized benchmarks, high computational cost, and limited explainability.
GAN-based defenses demonstrate strong potential but require advances in stable
architectures, benchmarking, transparency, and deployment. We propose a roadmap
emphasizing hybrid models, unified evaluation, real-world integration, and
defenses against emerging threats such as LLM-driven cyberattacks. This survey
establishes the foundation for scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive GAN-powered
defenses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper systematically reviews privacy and security issues in Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) and proposes a taxonomy to understand key data risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the privacy and security vulnerabilities inherited by Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) systems due to the integration of AI and Quantum Computing.

Method: The study involved a systematic review of 67 studies related to privacy and security, followed by the development of a taxonomy categorizing 22 data risks into five groups: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user considerations, and continuous monitoring.

Result: Findings highlight vulnerabilities unique to QAI, providing a comprehensive taxonomy and identifying gaps in risk assessments.

Conclusion: This research enhances the understanding of QAI data risks, offering a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI systems and future risk assessment tools.

Abstract: Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), the integration of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing (QC), promises transformative advances,
including AI-enabled quantum cryptography and quantum-resistant encryption
protocols. However, QAI inherits data risks from both AI and QC, creating
complex privacy and security vulnerabilities that are not systematically
studied. These risks affect the trustworthiness and reliability of AI and QAI
systems, making their understanding critical. This study systematically reviews
67 privacy- and security-related studies to expand understanding of QAI data
risks. We propose a taxonomy of 22 key data risks, organised into five
categories: governance, risk assessment, control implementation, user
considerations, and continuous monitoring. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities
unique to QAI and identify gaps in holistic risk assessment. This work
contributes to trustworthy AI and QAI research and provides a foundation for
developing future risk assessment tools.

### [407] [Every Character Counts: From Vulnerability to Defense in Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20589)
*Maria Chiper,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effectiveness of character-level deep learning models for phishing email detection, testing their performance under various conditions and advancing methods for their interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phishing attacks are a growing threat, and current detection methods lack robustness and interpretability, necessitating improved approaches.

Method: The study adapts three character-level deep learning models: CharCNN, CharGRU, and CharBiLSTM. These models are evaluated using a custom email dataset in scenarios involving standard training and testing, testing under adversarial attacks, and with adversarial examples. Grad-CAM is adapted for character-level visualization.

Result: CharGRU showed the best performance under constrained computational setups across all scenarios. Adversarial training notably improved the robustness of all models, which were otherwise vulnerable to attacks.

Conclusion: Character-level models, particularly CharGRU, are promising for phishing detection under resource constraints. Grad-CAM further enhances interpretability, and adversarial training boosts model robustness.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

### [408] [A Framework for Rapidly Developing and Deploying Protection Against Large Language Model Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20639)
*Adam Swanda,Amy Chang,Alexander Chen,Fraser Burch,Paul Kassianik,Konstantin Berlin*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a production-grade defense system against threats targeting Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating threat intelligence, data management, and seamless update mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the susceptibility of LLMs to novel and sophisticated security threats, requiring approaches akin to malware protection to mitigate risks effectively.

Method: The system employs a three-pronged approach consisting of a threat intelligence system for adapting to new threats, a data platform for observability and enriched learning, and a release platform for fast and safe detection updates.

Result: The result is a multi-layered protection system enabling continuous threat mitigation, enhancing model adaptability, and combining monitoring with seamless production updates.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that applying robust, adaptive defense systems similar to malware protection paradigms is essential for addressing the evolving threats in LLM applications.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI
deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across
industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in
model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of
access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling
targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws
necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or
novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category
similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing
guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability,
multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat
intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection
models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation
to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system
rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our
platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns
emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches
information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a
release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting
customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection
against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous
model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

*Xiao Liu,Mingyuan Li,Xu Wang,Guangsheng Yu,Wei Ni,Lixiang Li,Haipeng Peng,Renping Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BlockFUL is a framework designed for unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) systems with blockchain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning within FL frameworks that utilize blockchain is challenging due to interlinked records and inherited models.

Method: BlockFUL uses a dual-chain (live and archive) blockchain structure with gradient-ascent and re-training unlearning methods.

Result: BlockFUL methods are validated to reduce data dependency and computational cost, enhancing performance on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets.

Conclusion: BlockFUL presents an effective framework to resolve unlearning challenges in FL systems with blockchain by optimizing operational and computational overhead.

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

### [410] [PMark: Towards Robust and Distortion-free Semantic-level Watermarking with Channel Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21057)
*Jiahao Huo,Shuliang Liu,Bin Wang,Junyan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Aiwei Liu,Xuming Hu,Mingxun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces PMark, a robust and distortion-free semantic-level watermarking method for large language models (LLMs) to resist paraphrasing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic watermarking methods lack strong robustness guarantees against paraphrasing attacks and introduce distribution distortions.

Method: The paper develops PMark, a semantic-level watermarking approach based on proxy functions (PFs), employing dynamic median estimation and multi-channel constraints.

Result: PMark achieves improved robustness against paraphrasing attacks and maintains text quality without distortions compared to baseline SWM methods.

Conclusion: PMark offers a better framework for detecting machine-generated text, ensuring robustness and preserving output quality effectively.

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at

*Yu Liu,Boxiang He,Fanggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework called SS-ISAC, integrating security-aware semantic-driven communication and sensing with adversarial residual networks to prevent eavesdropping and maintain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address the dual challenge of optimizing sensing and communication performance while ensuring privacy and preventing eavesdropping threats in ISAC systems.

Method: The authors introduce encryption and decryption modules using trainable adversarial residual networks (ARNs) to both launch and mitigate adversarial attacks. These are jointly optimized with a loss function accounting for attack power, system performance, and privacy risks.

Result: Through simulations, the proposed SS-ISAC framework demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining SAC performance while also preventing eavesdropping threats.

Conclusion: The SS-ISAC framework presents a secure and flexible solution for ISAC systems, enhancing privacy without requiring significant hardware modifications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and flexible security-aware semantic-driven
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework, namely security semantic
ISAC (SS-ISAC). Inspired by the positive impact of the adversarial attack, a
pair of pluggable encryption and decryption modules is designed in the proposed
SS-ISAC framework. The encryption module is installed after the semantic
transmitter, adopting a trainable adversarial residual network (ARN) to create
the adversarial attack. Correspondingly, the decryption module before the
semantic receiver utilizes another trainable ARN to mitigate the adversarial
attack and noise. These two modules can be flexibly assembled considering the
system security demands, without drastically modifying the hardware
infrastructure. To ensure the sensing and communication (SAC) performance while
preventing the eavesdropping threat, the above ARNs are jointly optimized by
minimizing a carefully designed loss function that relates to the adversarial
attack power, SAC performance, as well as the privacy leakage risk. Simulation
results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SS-ISAC framework in terms
of both SAC and eavesdropping prevention performance.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper develops an intrusion detection framework for drone networks using ensemble-based machine learning models, achieving top performance with Random Forest while ensuring model interpretability with SHAP and LIME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about cybersecurity in drone networks due to sophisticated attacks highlight the need for reliable detection and classification systems.

Method: Comparative analysis of ensemble machine learning models trained on labeled datasets with strong preprocessing and evaluation metrics. Explainable AI tools, SHAP and LIME, were used for transparency.

Result: Random Forest achieved the best results with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. Statistical tests confirmed superiority of the models, backed by strong interpretability implementations.

Conclusion: The framework offers superior accuracy and interpretability, making it ideal for real-time, safety-critical drone network applications.

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense
sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the
increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication
protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging
due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple
sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and
interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a
focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We
present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models,
namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on
a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types.
Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value
imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and
extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews
Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest
performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate
the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence
intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME,
were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance,
enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed
approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures
interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical
drone operations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pipeline to collect and filter cybersecurity threat-related messages from Telegram, creating a high-quality dataset for threat intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to build high-quality cybersecurity datasets to anticipate, detect, and mitigate evolving cyber threats effectively.

Method: An automated pipeline collects threat-related messages from Telegram channels, applies a BERT-based classifier to filter relevant content, and compiles indicators of compromise into a dataset.

Result: The pipeline scraped 145,349 messages, filtered them with 96.64% classifier accuracy, and compiled a dataset of 86,509 malicious indicators.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable method for generating high-fidelity cyber threat intelligence datasets, with implications for future research and operational applications.

Abstract: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) enables organizations to anticipate, detect,
and mitigate evolving cyber threats. Its effectiveness depends on high-quality
datasets, which support model development, training, evaluation, and
benchmarking. Building such datasets is crucial, as attack vectors and
adversary tactics continually evolve. Recently, Telegram has gained prominence
as a valuable CTI source, offering timely and diverse threat-related
information that can help address these challenges. In this work, we address
these challenges by presenting an end-to-end automated pipeline that
systematically collects and filters threat-related content from Telegram. The
pipeline identifies relevant Telegram channels and scrapes 145,349 messages
from 12 curated channels out of 150 identified sources. To accurately filter
threat intelligence messages from generic content, we employ a BERT-based
classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. From the filtered messages, we
compile a dataset of 86,509 malicious Indicators of Compromise, including
domains, IPs, URLs, hashes, and CVEs. This approach not only produces a
large-scale, high-fidelity CTI dataset but also establishes a foundation for
future research and operational applications in cyber threat detection.

*Ibrahim Altan,Abdulla Bachir,Yousuf Parbhulkar,Abdul Muksith Rizvi,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a combined approach using transformer-based NLP and classical machine learning to improve phishing email detection by analyzing both text and URLs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the failure of traditional phishing detection methods that focus on isolated analysis, which is insufficient against sophisticated phishing tactics.

Method: The proposed method integrates DistilBERT for semantic text analysis and Random Forest with character-level TF-IDF for structural link analysis, offering a dual-path detection framework.

Result: Empirical evaluations show significant improvement in detection accuracy, with DistilBERT excelling in textual analysis and Random Forest outperforming other classifiers in URL analysis.

Conclusion: This dual-path framework enhances phishing detection through scalable, accurate, and interpretable methods that improve email security against advanced threats.

Abstract: Phishing emails pose a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat,
undermining email security through deceptive tactics designed to exploit both
semantic and structural vulnerabilities. Traditional detection methods, often
based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to
comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a
dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based
natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly
analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary
strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures
(e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF
vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest).
Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that
this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically,
the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest
notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs.
The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble
integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results
highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach,
establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of
enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.

*Anh Tu Ngo,Anupam Chattopadhyay,Subhamoy Maitra*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the dual application of cryptographic backdoors in neural networks—both for creating robust attacks and implementing defenses like watermarking, authentication, and IP tracking, tested empirically and supported theoretically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how cryptographic backdoors can serve dual roles: enabling undetectable attacks and enhancing defenses, like watermarking, authentication, and intellectual property tracking in neural networks.

Method: The authors utilize cryptographic principles inspired by prior theoretical work and implement protocols for defense mechanisms as well as backdoor-enabled attacks, followed by empirical validation on state-of-the-art neural network architectures.

Result: The results show that their defense protocols are provably robust against black-box adversaries, while also demonstrating the potential of cryptographic backdoors for executing powerful and invisible attacks.

Conclusion: The study establishes the potential for integrating cryptographic backdoors in neural networks for both offensive and defensive purposes, laying theoretical and practical groundwork for quantum-resistant and advanced machine learning security measures.

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN)
can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well
as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted
cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN.
Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN
watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication;
and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual
property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from
Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these
instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The
protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary
with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial
attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the
theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et.
al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all
these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with
empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can
utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors,
laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

IoT devices while maintaining privacy of the locally collected data. However,
existing privacy- preserving techniques present notable hurdles. Methods such
as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential

enhancing both privacy and efficiency in FL, including Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs), Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Quantum Computing
(QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm
Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL
pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations.
We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues,
offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

### [417] [QAMO: Quality-aware Multi-centroid One-class Learning For Speech Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20679)
*Duc-Tuan Truong,Tianchi Liu,Ruijie Tao,Junjie Li,Kong Aik Lee,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel deepfake speech detection method called QAMO that uses multiple centroids based on speech quality, outperforming existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current one-class learning method for deepfake speech detection assumes a single centroid for bona fide speech, oversimplifying the speech representation and ignoring useful cues like speech quality.

Method: The authors propose QAMO, which introduces multiple quality-aware centroids to represent different speech quality subspaces, and utilizes a multi-centroid ensemble scoring strategy to optimize detection performance.

Result: QAMO achieves an equal error rate (EER) of 5.09% on the In-the-Wild dataset, outperforming previous approaches based on one-class learning and speech quality.

Conclusion: QAMO improves deepfake detection by leveraging speech quality subspaces with multiple centroids and offers better performance and decision thresholding compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Recent work shows that one-class learning can detect unseen deepfake attacks
by modeling a compact distribution of bona fide speech around a single
centroid. However, the single-centroid assumption can oversimplify the bona
fide speech representation and overlook useful cues, such as speech quality,
which reflects the naturalness of the speech. Speech quality can be easily
obtained using existing speech quality assessment models that estimate it
through Mean Opinion Score. In this paper, we propose QAMO: Quality-Aware
Multi-Centroid One-Class Learning for speech deepfake detection. QAMO extends
conventional one-class learning by introducing multiple quality-aware
centroids. In QAMO, each centroid is optimized to represent a distinct speech
quality subspaces, enabling better modeling of intra-class variability in bona
fide speech. In addition, QAMO supports a multi-centroid ensemble scoring
strategy, which improves decision thresholding and reduces the need for quality

speech, our proposed QAMO achieves an equal error rate of 5.09% in In-the-Wild
dataset, outperforming previous one-class and quality-aware systems.

### [418] [Addressing Gradient Misalignment in Data-Augmented Training for Robust Speech Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20682)
*Duc-Tuan Truong,Tianchi Liu,Junjie Li,Ruijie Tao,Kong Aik Lee,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates the issue of gradient conflicts during training for speech deepfake detection using data augmentation, proposing a dual-path training framework with gradient alignment that improves model performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of misaligned gradients during training in speech deepfake detection, which can hinder model convergence and performance when using data augmentation.

Method: The authors introduced a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training framework, where each training example undergoes two input paths (original and augmented speech). The method compares and aligns gradient directions to reduce conflicts.

Result: Approximately 25% of training iterations exhibit gradient conflicts when using RawBoost augmentation. The proposed framework resolves these conflicts, accelerates convergence, and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset.

Conclusion: By employing gradient alignment in the DPDA framework, the method reduces optimization conflicts, resulting in faster convergence and improved performance in speech deepfake detection compared to conventional data augmentation approaches.

Abstract: In speech deepfake detection (SDD), data augmentation (DA) is commonly used
to improve model generalization across varied speech conditions and spoofing
attacks. However, during training, the backpropagated gradients from original
and augmented inputs may misalign, which can result in conflicting parameter
updates. These conflicts could hinder convergence and push the model toward
suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing the benefits of DA. To investigate and
address this issue, we design a dual-path data-augmented (DPDA) training
framework with gradient alignment for SDD. In our framework, each training
utterance is processed through two input paths: one using the original speech
and the other with its augmented version. This design allows us to compare and
align their backpropagated gradient directions to reduce optimization
conflicts. Our analysis shows that approximately 25% of training iterations
exhibit gradient conflicts between the original inputs and their augmented
counterparts when using RawBoost augmentation. By resolving these conflicts
with gradient alignment, our method accelerates convergence by reducing the
number of training epochs and achieves up to an 18.69% relative reduction in
Equal Error Rate on the In-the-Wild dataset compared to the baseline.

*Anupam Purwar,Aditya Choudhary*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing a low-latency voice-to-voice (V-2-V) communication model for real-time applications by focusing on speech recognition, text-to-speech (TTS), and dialog management components, with special attention on TTS optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a real-time conversational voice-to-voice system capable of maintaining high-quality interactions while reducing processing time.

Method: The authors analyzed a V-2-V architecture utilizing CSM1b to understand tone and context. They optimized the TTS component by adjusting Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) iterations and codebooks used in Mimi.

Result: The study found that TTS has the most significant impact on Real Time Factor (RTF) and that reducing RVQ iterations and codebooks can bring meaningful optimizations to V-2-V systems.

Conclusion: Optimizing TTS components, particularly through adjustments in RVQ iterations and codebooks, is crucial for improving the efficiency and quality of real-time voice-to-voice applications.

Abstract: We experiment with a low-latency, end-to-end voice-to-voice communication
model to optimize it for real-time conversational applications. By analyzing
components essential to voice to voice (V-2-V) system viz. automatic speech
recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and dialog management, our work
analyzes how to reduce processing time while maintaining high-quality
interactions to identify the levers for optimizing V-2-V system. Our work
identifies that TTS component which generates life-like voice, full of emotions
including natural pauses and exclamations has highest impact on Real time
factor (RTF). The experimented V-2-V architecture utilizes CSM1b has the
capability to understand tone as well as context of conversation by ingesting
both audio and text of prior exchanges to generate contextually accurate
speech. We explored optimization of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)
iterations by the TTS decoder which come at a cost of decrease in the quality
of voice generated. Our experimental evaluations also demonstrate that for
V-2-V implementations based on CSM most important optimizations can be brought
by reducing the number of RVQ Iterations along with the codebooks used in Mimi.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces Support Vector Regularization (SVR) to enhance contrastive language-audio pretraining by stabilizing the optimization process, using support vectors to harness negative sample information effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To stabilize the training process and improve representation learning for multimodal tasks when using negative samples in contrastive language-audio pretraining.

Method: The authors proposed SVR, an auxiliary support vector strategy to control the perpendicular component of negative samples during training. They explored two unsupervised modeling strategies to optimize SVR's semantic radius.

Result: SVR consistently outperforms popular methods like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss in tasks such as classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval.

Conclusion: Support Vector Regularization successfully mitigates optimization trajectory drift and improves training stability and performance, validated by both theoretical analysis and experimentation.

Abstract: Contrastive language-audio pretraining, which aims to unify multimodal
representations in a shared embedding space, serves as a cornerstone for
building a wide range of applications, from cross-modal retrieval to
cutting-edge multimodal large language models. However, we find that the
perpendicular component of the pushing force from negative samples in
contrastive learning is a double-edged sword: it contains rich supplementary
information from negative samples, yet its unconstrained nature causes
optimization trajectory drift and training instability. To address this, we
propose Support Vector Regularization (SVR), a method that introduces an
auxiliary support vector to control this perpendicular component, aiming to
harness its rich information while mitigating the associated trajectory drift.
The efficacy of SVR is critically governed by its semantic radius, for which we
explore two unsupervised modeling strategies: direct parameterization and an
adaptive radius predictor module enhanced with constraints to improve its
predicting accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses widely used baselines like InfoNCE and SigLIP loss across
classification, monolingual retrieval, and multilingual retrieval on standard
audio-text datasets. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results
on optimizing trajectory drift validate the correctness and effectiveness of
our SVR method.

*Sitong Cheng,Weizhen Bian,Xinsheng Wang,Ruibin Yuan,Jianyi Chen,Shunshun Yin,Yike Guo,Wei Xue*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniSS, a novel single-stage framework for expressive speech-to-speech translation, addressing challenges like limited data, processing complexity, and ineffective LLM capability transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome challenges in expressive speech-to-speech translation, such as the lack of paired speech data, complex multi-stage pipelines, and poor transfer of translation capabilities from large language models.

Method: The authors designed a system with advanced speech semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with text-based large language models. They employed a cross-modal chain-of-thought prompting process to align audio semantics with text and ensure style preservation.

Result: UniSS outperformed previous methods in translation fidelity, speech quality, and the preservation of vocal, emotional, and duration consistency. They also introduced UniST, a 44.8k-hour expressive dataset.

Conclusion: The work simplifies and improves the expressive S2ST system paradigm and paves the path for next-generation translation technologies.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of expressive speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) is to
accurately translate spoken content while preserving the speaker identity and
emotional style. However, progress in this field is largely hindered by three
key challenges: the scarcity of paired speech data that retains expressive
styles, the complexity of multi-stage processing pipelines, and the limited
transfer of translation capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we address these challenges by introducing UniSS, a novel single-stage
framework for expressive S2ST. Our approach features carefully designed speech
semantic and style modeling, enabling seamless integration with existing
text-based LLM frameworks to develop a unified text-speech language model. To
transfer translation capabilities from text to speech, we propose a cross-modal
chain-of-thought prompting process that progressively aligns audio semantics
with text and ensures style preservation in the decoded results. Furthermore,
we construct and release a large-scale, high-quality expressive S2ST dataset,
UniST, comprising 44.8k hours of data. Experimental results show that UniSS
significantly outperforms previous methods in translation fidelity and speech
quality while preserving voice, emotion, and duration consistency. Our work
establishes a simpler and more effective paradigm for building the next
generation of expressive S2ST systems. Audio samples are available at

TL;DR: The paper explores 3D diamond pixel sensors for high-radiation environments in tracking detectors, using advanced modeling and AI techniques to analyze timing degradation caused by electrode resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To meet demands for radiation-tolerant tracking detectors with high precision and fast timing in future high-luminosity hadron colliders.

Method: A 3rd-order 3+1D PDE model coupled with charge transport simulations, alongside Physics-Informed Neural Network-based meshless solver for timing assessment.

Result: Numerical solutions and AI techniques successfully assess timing degradation from conductive electrode resistance.

Conclusion: 3D diamond pixel sensors can address detector requirements; modeling and AI approaches validate their efficacy and highlight electrode resistance effects on performance.

Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with
extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing.
3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation
hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via
femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal
propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley
weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order,
3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations.
The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for
realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural
Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess
timing degradation from electrode resistance.

Result: Findings include the detailed structure analysis of maxout polytopes, including characterizations of their geometric properties and their nature as cubical for generic setups.

Conclusion: Maxout polytopes exhibit specific geometric and combinatorial properties influenced by network structure and parameters, notably showing cubical traits in generic settings without bottlenecks.

Abstract: Maxout polytopes are defined by feedforward neural networks with maxout
activation function and non-negative weights after the first layer. We
characterize the parameter spaces and extremal f-vectors of maxout polytopes
for shallow networks, and we study the separating hypersurfaces which arise
when a layer is added to the network. We also show that maxout polytopes are
cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an optimal transport-based method to improve blind hyperspectral unmixing in highly mixed data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating abundance matrices in hyperspectral unmixing when the data is highly mixed.

Method: The proposed method employs optimal transport to constrain the estimated abundance matrix distribution to align more closely with a targeted Dirichlet distribution, incorporating this as a regularization term in an optimization framework.

Result: The method improves endmember estimation in highly mixed data scenarios and is robust to variations in the targeted abundance distribution.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the efficiency of hyperspectral unmixing by leveraging optimal transport for better abundance matrix estimation, demonstrating significant robustness and applicability.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.

*Niclas Pokel,Pehuén Moure,Roman Boehringer,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalization method for ASR to improve accuracy for non-normative speech impacted by impairments, using uncertainty estimation and targeted training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by ASR systems when recognizing non-normative speech caused by impairments, compounded by high acoustic variability and limited data.

Method: The approach uses Monte Carlo Dropout to measure uncertainty in phoneme-level recognition, guiding a tailored oversampling strategy to target difficult phonemes.

Result: Validated on English and German datasets, the method improved ASR accuracy and aligned model uncertainty with clinical assessments of speech difficulty.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guided sampling offers a practical framework for creating personalized, inclusive ASR systems while advancing the alignment between AI insights and expert clinical evaluation.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with non-normative speech
from individuals with impairments caused by conditions like cerebral palsy or
structural anomalies. The high acoustic variability and scarcity of training
data severely degrade model performance. This work introduces a data-efficient
personalization method that quantifies phoneme-level uncertainty to guide
fine-tuning. We leverage Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate which phonemes a model
finds most difficult and use these estimates for a targeted oversampling
strategy. We validate our method on English and German datasets. Crucially, we
demonstrate that our model-derived uncertainty strongly correlates with
phonemes identified as challenging in an expert clinical logopedic report,
marking, to our knowledge, the first work to successfully align model
uncertainty with expert assessment of speech difficulty. Our results show that
this clinically-validated, uncertainty-guided sampling significantly improves
ASR accuracy, delivering a practical framework for personalized and inclusive
ASR.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) for individuals with speech impairments by introducing a new ASR personalization method using Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty ASR systems face in recognizing non-normative speech due to limited datasets and high acoustic variability, and to ease the burden of data collection and annotation for individuals with speech impairments.

Method: The paper introduces a novel personalization technique for ASR systems that leverages Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation, enabling data-efficient fine-tuning. The method was tested on the UA-Speech and newly collected BF-Sprache datasets.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhanced ASR performance for speech-impaired users while minimizing the need for extensive data and manual annotations.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a practical and efficient path for developing inclusive ASR systems tailored for individuals with speech impairments in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Speech impairments resulting from congenital disorders, such as cerebral
palsy, down syndrome, or apert syndrome, as well as acquired brain injuries due
to stroke, traumatic accidents, or tumors, present major challenges to
automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Despite recent advancements,
state-of-the-art ASR models like Whisper still struggle with non-normative
speech due to limited training data availability and high acoustic variability.
Moreover, collecting and annotating non-normative speech is burdensome:
speaking is effortful for many affected individuals, while laborious annotation
often requires caregivers familiar with the speaker. This work introduces a
novel ASR personalization method based on Bayesian Low-rank Adaptation for
data-efficient fine-tuning. We validate our method on the English UA-Speech
dataset and a newly collected German speech dataset, BF-Sprache, from a child
with structural speech impairment. The dataset and approach are designed to
reflect the challenges of low-resource settings that include individuals with
speech impairments. Our method significantly improves ASR accuracy for impaired
speech while maintaining data and annotation efficiency, offering a practical
path toward inclusive ASR.

*Ismail Rasim Ulgen,Zongyang Du,Junchen Lu,Philipp Koehn,Berrak Sisman*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: TTScore is a reference-free evaluation framework for assessing intelligibility and prosody in synthesized speech, using token-based sequence-to-sequence predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating synthesized speech, such as WER and pitch-based measures, have limitations and weak correlations with human perception.

Method: TTScore employs conditional prediction with two sequence-to-sequence models: one targeting intelligibility and another targeting prosody, using token likelihoods as scores.

Result: Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate TTScore's reliable evaluation capabilities and stronger correlation with human quality judgments compared to existing metrics.

Conclusion: TTScore enhances objective speech evaluation by providing targeted, interpretable, and human-perception-aligned metrics for intelligibility and prosody.

Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech
generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain
limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate
(WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while
F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent
view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted
and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of
discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors
conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through
content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody
tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood
of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that
capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure.
Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that
TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and
achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than
existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system that operates on CPU hardware, addressing limitations in robustness against environmental noise and interfering speakers.

Method: The system uses pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to capture lip movement information and enhance the target speech.

Result: RAVEN achieves robustness across environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and singing voices, while functioning interactively in real time.

Conclusion: RAVEN demonstrates the feasibility of a CPU-based real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system, enabling improved speech clarity in various noise scenarios.

Abstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech
enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel,
audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task
of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has
explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness,
particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our
knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time
audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap
by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition
model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across
environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing
voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live
audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup,
with clean speech playback through headphones.

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of advanced speech enhancement models to adversarial attacks and notes that diffusion models show inherent robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the susceptibility of advanced speech enhancement systems to adversarial attacks and understand the robustness of different model designs.

Method: The authors crafted adversarial noise masked by the original input and tested its impact on speech enhancement models, while also examining the robustness of diffusion models.

Result: Contemporary predictive speech enhancement models were shown to be susceptible to manipulation, whereas diffusion models exhibited inherent robustness to adversarial noise.

Conclusion: Advanced speech enhancement systems need to address vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, and diffusion models could offer a more robust alternative by design.

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly
expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability:
advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks.
Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and
psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the
enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We
experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models
can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion
models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial
attacks by design.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper examines how health advice videos on short-form video platforms build credibility through authority signals, narrative techniques, and monetization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between credibility signals and narrative techniques in nutrition and supplement videos on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.

Method: The researchers developed a multimodal annotation pipeline that identified features such as visual authority, presenter attributes, and narrative strategies in a dataset of 152 videos. Human verification ensured accuracy.

Result: The study found that confident presenters in home/studio settings dominate and that authority signals (e.g., charts, certificates) are often combined with persuasive or emotive elements (e.g., fear, urgency, opposition to mainstream medicine). These features also coincide with monetization strategies like sales links.

Conclusion: Videos often pair scientific references with emotive or conspiratorial narratives, highlighting the complexity of evaluating content credibility in online health advice.

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "group anchors" as influential individuals at the core of group interactions and develops AnchorRadar, a semi-supervised method to identify group anchors effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of identifying key individuals who serve as central figures in various group interactions in real-world contexts.

Method: AnchorRadar is proposed as a semi-supervised approach, leveraging limited labeled data and information from both groups with and without known anchors.

Result: Through experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, AnchorRadar outperformed several baselines in accuracy, required significantly less training time (10.2× faster), and utilized fewer learnable parameters (43.6× fewer on average).

Conclusion: AnchorRadar effectively identifies group anchors and offers superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability for real-world group interaction analysis.

Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship,
email communication, and online Q&A. In each group, there is often a
particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples
include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the
questioner in a Q&A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such
individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group
anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the
concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our
observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our
observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group
anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when
only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method
using information from groups both with and without known group anchors.
Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we
demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines
w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher
accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using
10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$
fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning method to hide community affiliations in social graphs while preserving topology, targeting overlapping communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting privacy in social graphs, particularly hiding sensitive information like community affiliations, is crucial due to the risks of graph analysis.

Method: The authors use a deep reinforcement learning approach to identify effective edge modifications, leveraging proxy nodes and considering overlapping community structures.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing baselines in effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust and efficient solution for privacy-preserving graph modifications in overlapping community structures.

Abstract: Protecting privacy in social graphs requires preventing sensitive
information, such as community affiliations, from being inferred by graph
analysis, without substantially altering the graph topology. We address this
through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks
edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community,
regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on
non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice,
but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such
strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize
and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including
the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on
real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for
privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a software architecture to enhance safety, security, and predictability in learning-based autonomous systems, addressing issues like neural network untrustworthiness and cyber-attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks, despite their success in various applications, are prone to misbehaviors like adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, raising concerns for their deployment in autonomous systems.

Method: The architecture uses dual isolated execution domains hosted on a single platform via type-1 real-time hypervisor. One domain handles neural network tasks under a rich OS, while the other oversees safety-critical operations with real-time capabilities.

Result: Experiments conducted on a Furuta pendulum and rover demonstrated the effectiveness of the fall-back safety monitor in mitigating faults caused by the learning component.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enhances reliability in autonomous systems, particularly in safety-critical scenarios, by integrating a fail-safe mechanism to address neural network failures.

Abstract: Recently, the outstanding performance reached by neural networks in many
tasks has led to their deployment in autonomous systems, such as robots and
vehicles. However, neural networks are not yet trustworthy, being prone to
different types of misbehavior, such as anomalous samples, distribution shifts,
adversarial attacks, and other threats. Furthermore, frameworks for
accelerating the inference of neural networks typically run on rich operating
systems that are less predictable in terms of timing behavior and present
larger surfaces for cyber-attacks.
  To address these issues, this paper presents a software architecture for
enhancing safety, security, and predictability levels of learning-based
autonomous systems. It leverages two isolated execution domains, one dedicated
to the execution of neural networks under a rich operating system, which is
deemed not trustworthy, and one responsible for running safety-critical
functions, possibly under a different operating system capable of handling
real-time constraints.
  Both domains are hosted on the same computing platform and isolated through a
type-1 real-time hypervisor enabling fast and predictable inter-domain
communication to exchange real-time data. The two domains cooperate to provide
a fail-safe mechanism based on a safety monitor, which oversees the state of
the system and switches to a simpler but safer backup module, hosted in the
safety-critical domain, whenever its behavior is considered untrustworthy.
  The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated by a set of
experiments performed on two control systems: a Furuta pendulum and a rover.
The results confirm the utility of the fall-back mechanism in preventing faults
due to the learning component.

### [434] [Extrapolating Phase-Field Simulations in Space and Time with Purely Convolutional Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20770)
*Christophe Bonneville,Nathan Bieberdorf,Pieterjan Robbe,Mark Asta,Habib N. Najm,Laurent Capolungo,Cosmin Safta*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a U-Net-based surrogate model for simulating liquid metal dealloying using phase-field models, achieving high computational speed and accuracy even over large domains and long time horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase-field models for liquid metal dealloying are computationally intensive and impractical for large domains or extended simulations, necessitating faster approaches without compromising accuracy.

Method: The authors developed a U-Net model with convolutional self-attention, physics-aware padding, and parameterized conditioning, enabling simulations with variable time-step skipping and adaptability to different alloy systems.

Result: The model achieves extrapolation far beyond its training data in space and time, maintaining relative errors typically under 5% in the training regime and under 10% when applied to larger scopes. It also accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates a significant advance in scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models, reducing computational challenges and paving the way for broader applications.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

*Benedikt Hoock,Tobias Köppl*

Main category: q-bio.TO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural network method for calibrating Windkessel parameters in a 1D-0D blood flow model, aiming for accuracy even with noisy or approximate measurement data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the calibration of Windkessel parameters in blood flow models, particularly to handle challenges like unknown measurement locations or noisy data.

Method: A neural network is trained on simulated blood pressure data to emulate pulse waves. For calibration on measured data, dummy neurons are added, and the network is retrained.

Result: The proposed method achieves negligible computational error and demonstrates effectiveness across varying scenarios and constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed neural network method can accurately calibrate Windkessel parameters, even under challenging conditions like imprecise location or noisy data.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK)
parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this
end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood
pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the
pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space
and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To
calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by
dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is
to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly,
when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by
noise.

*Sangwook Lee,Adnan Abbas,Yan Chen,Young-Ho Kim,Sang Won Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper designed and tested CHOIR, an LLM-based chatbot, to address organizational memory challenges in university research labs by improving knowledge extraction, sharing, and documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research labs face challenges in preserving critical knowledge and supporting documentation due to the ephemeral nature of chat-based communications.

Method: The authors conducted formative interviews to identify issues in organizational memory management. Based on findings, they designed CHOIR with four functions and deployed it in four labs, analyzing usage and feedback during a one-month period.

Result: CHOIR facilitated 107 Q&A interactions and 38 document updates. It uncovered tensions between private question-asking and documentation visibility, along with students’ hesitancy in contributing universal documentation.

Conclusion: The paper provides design insights to address privacy issues in knowledge sharing and improve support for context-specific documentation in collaborative environments.

Abstract: University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication
and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in
message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing
maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews
that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an
LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key
functions: document-grounded Q&A, Q&A sharing for follow-up discussion,
knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We
deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab
members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the
organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension:
questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into
documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in
generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute
design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting
context-specific knowledge documentation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Perspectra, a multi-agent system that enhances user control and collaboration among AI agents using an intuitive, interactive forum-based interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in how users can effectively control and critically evaluate collaborations among multiple domain-specific AI agents in multi-agent systems.

Method: The authors developed Perspectra, an interface that uses forum-style interactions, agent @-mentions, parallel threading, and real-time mind mapping. They conducted a within-subject study with 18 participants to compare its efficacy against a group chat baseline.

Result: The study showed that Perspectra significantly improved critical-thinking behaviors, promoted interdisciplinary responses, and led to more frequent revisions of research proposals compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: Perspectra facilitates better user control and critical thinking in multi-agent collaborations and suggests new design directions for MAS tools that scaffold adversarial discourse.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information
search and ideation by assigning personas to agents. However, how users can
effectively control, steer, and critically evaluate collaboration among
multiple domain-expert agents remains underexplored. We present Perspectra, an
interactive MAS that visualizes and structures deliberation among LLM agents
via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent
adversarial discourse.

TL;DR: MechStyle is a system that allows creators to stylize 3D printable models using Generative AI while preserving structural integrity through Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creators face challenges in maintaining the structural integrity of 3D models when stylizing them with Generative AI methods.

Method: MechStyle integrates FEA simulation feedback into the stylization process, minimizing geometric changes in high-stress regions and employing adaptive scheduling strategies.

Result: The study compares different stylization control strategies and scheduling methods to demonstrate the system's effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: MechStyle successfully enables the creation of 3D stylized models that are both aesthetically appealing and structurally reliable, supported by five practical applications.

Abstract: Recent developments in Generative AI enable creators to stylize 3D models
based on text prompts. These methods change the 3D model geometry, which can
compromise the model's structural integrity once fabricated. We present
MechStyle, a system that enables creators to stylize 3D printable models while
preserving their structural integrity. MechStyle accomplishes this by
augmenting the Generative AI-based stylization process with feedback from a
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. As the stylization process modifies
the geometry to approximate the desired style, feedback from the FEA simulation
reduces modifications to regions with increased stress. We evaluate the
effectiveness of FEA simulation feedback in the augmented stylization process
by comparing three stylization control strategies. We also investigate the time
efficiency of our approach by comparing three adaptive scheduling strategies.
Finally, we demonstrate MechStyle's user interface that allows users to
generate stylized and structurally viable 3D models and provide five example
applications.

*Avinash Ajit Nargund,Arthur Caetano,Kevin Yang,Rose Yiwei Liu,Philip Tezaur,Kriteen Shrestha,Qisen Pan,Tobias Höllerer,Misha Sra*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper studies dynamic user control switching in Human-AI collaboration using chess tasks. The research highlighted behavioral signals and decision complexity as key factors for improving control-level prediction models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Human-AI collaborative systems often neglect user preference shifts during tasks due to trust changes, decision complexity, and perceived control, limiting dynamic adaptability.

Method: Participants engaged in a chess task alternating between AI-assisted ('brain') and user-assisted ('hand') modes. Behavioral data and task complexity were analyzed, leading to the development of predictive models for control switching.

Result: Statistical analysis highlighted gaze and subtask complexity differences preceding mode switches, while a developed predictive model achieved notable accuracy ($F1 = 0.65$).

Conclusion: Behavioral indicators can enhance real-time control-switching mechanisms in shared autonomy systems, improving alignment with user intent and evolving needs.

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration is typically offered in one of two of user control
levels: guidance, where the AI provides suggestions and the human makes the
final decision, and delegation, where the AI acts autonomously within
user-defined constraints. Systems that integrate both modes, common in robotic
surgery or driving assistance, often overlook shifts in user preferences within
a task in response to factors like evolving trust, decision complexity, and
perceived control. In this work, we investigate how users dynamically switch
between higher and lower levels of control during a sequential decision-making
task. Using a hand-and-brain chess setup, participants either selected a piece
and the AI decided how it moved (brain mode), or the AI selected a piece and
the participant decided how it moved (hand mode). We collected over 400
mode-switching decisions from eight participants, along with gaze, emotional
state, and subtask difficulty data. Statistical analysis revealed significant
differences in gaze patterns and subtask complexity prior to a switch and in
the quality of the subsequent move. Based on these results, we engineered
behavioral and task-specific features to train a lightweight model that
predicted control level switches ($F1 = 0.65$). The model performance suggests
that real-time behavioral signals can serve as a complementary input alongside
system-driven mode-switching mechanisms currently used. We complement our
quantitative results with qualitative factors that influence switching
including perceived AI ability, decision complexity, and level of control,
identified from post-game interview analysis. The combined behavioral and
modeling insights can help inform the design of shared autonomy systems that
need dynamic, subtask-level control switches aligned with user intent and
evolving task demands.

TL;DR: This paper explores professional designers' perspectives on integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows, investigating roles, authority distribution, and collaboration dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how designers interact and feel about collaborative agentic AI systems that perform mundane tasks and assist in creative workflows.

Method: The authors employed design fiction, engaging ten professional designers to imagine and discuss collaboration scenarios with an AI agent for IDE (Inspiration and Ideation).

Result: Key findings reveal roles AI agents can play, how authority is distributed between designers and AI, and alternative ways of explaining designers' intent to AI agents.

Conclusion: A conceptual framework on authority distribution between designers and AI is proposed, with directions for integrating AI agents in future creative workflows.

Abstract: As designers become familiar with Generative AI, a new concept is emerging:
Agentic AI. While generative AI produces output in response to prompts, agentic
AI systems promise to perform mundane tasks autonomously, potentially freeing
designers to focus on what they love: being creative. But how do designers feel
about integrating agentic AI systems into their workflows? Through design
fiction, we investigated how designers want to interact with a collaborative
agentic AI platform. Ten professional designers imagined and discussed
collaborating with an AI agent to organise inspiration sources and ideate. Our
findings highlight the roles AI agents can play in supporting designers, the
division of authority between humans and AI, and how designers' intent can be
explained to AI agents beyond prompts. We synthesise our findings into a
conceptual framework that identifies authority distribution among humans and AI
agents and discuss directions for utilising AI agents in future design
workflows.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines the impact of AI-driven VTubers, focusing on viewer perceptions of Neuro-sama by analyzing social media content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the growing popularity of VTubers and the operational risks associated with human controllers, exploring AI-driven VTubers as an alternative.

Method: A case study was conducted analyzing 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments related to Neuro-sama, an AI VTuber.

Result: Viewers' motivations, AI's role in constructing a virtual persona, and perceptions of AI as a replacement for human controllers were identified and analyzed.

Conclusion: AI-driven VTubers provide operational benefits but raise concerns about authenticity and engagement, thus significantly impacting digital streaming culture.

Abstract: VTubers, digital personas represented by animated avatars, have gained
massive popularity. Traditionally, VTubers are operated and voiced by human
controllers known as Nakanohito. The reliance on Nakanohito, however, poses
risks due to potential personal controversies and operational disruptions. The
emergence of AI-driven VTubers offers a new model free from these human
constraints. While AI-driven VTubers present benefits such as continuous
operation and reduced scandal risk, they also raise questions about
authenticity and audience engagement. Therefore, to gain deeper insights, we
conduct a case study, investigating viewer perceptions of Neuro-sama, the most
popular AI-driven VTuber with 845k followers on Twitch and 753k followers on
YouTube. We analyze 108k Reddit posts and 136k YouTube comments, aiming to
better understand viewer motivations, how AI constructs the virtual persona,
and perceptions of the AI as Nakanohito. Our findings enhance the understanding
of AI-driven VTubers and their impact on digital streaming culture.

TL;DR: The paper introduces iatroX, a clinical reference platform leveraging retrieval-augmented generation to address information overload for clinicians. Early user evaluations highlight its usability and potential clinical value despite noted limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinicians struggle with information overload from biomedical literature and guidelines, necessitating tools that can quickly provide reliable, evidence-based answers.

Method: The study analyzed usage metrics of iatroX over 16 weeks using web and app analytics, combined with a randomized intercept survey assessing perceptions of usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent.

Result: iatroX was adopted by a significant user base, achieving over 202,660 engagement events and 40,000 clinical queries. Survey results showed high perceived usefulness (86.2%), reliability (79.4%), and intent to recommend (88.4%).

Conclusion: iatroX demonstrates promise in reducing clinician information overload with fast, reliable answers. Limitations such as small sampling and early-adopter bias point to the need for further real-world evaluations and accuracy audits.

Abstract: Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and
guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but
requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based
clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and
perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods
comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over
16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage
metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side
script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a
predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent.
Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text
comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web
users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile
uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active
users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness
86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%;
14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived
accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI
62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK
specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information
overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include
small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include
accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and fragmented development of sparse and dense training frameworks in recommendation models, particularly focusing on industrial applications.

Method: Development of RecIS, a Python ecosystem-based framework combining sparse-dense training components, optimized for industrial recommendation tasks.

Result: RecIS demonstrates improved efficiency for industrial recommendation model training, particularly outperforming TensorFlow-based models in sparse component optimization, and is adopted by Alibaba.

Conclusion: RecIS provides an efficient, unified approach for sparse-dense model training in recommendation systems, with proven application in large-scale industrial environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RecIS, a unified Sparse-Dense training framework

training needs of industrial-grade recommendation models that integrated with
large models. 2.System Optimization To optimize the sparse component, offering
superior efficiency over the TensorFlow-based recommendation models. The dense

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF) that uses natural language commands to improve user satisfaction and recommendation effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems are limited by passive feedback mechanisms, failing to capture nuanced user intentions and behaviors.

Method: Introduces IRF with RecBot, a dual-agent system that translates natural language into structured preferences and adjusts recommendation policies in real-time.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that RecBot significantly enhances user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Conclusion: IRF and RecBot provide a pioneering approach to active and explicit user control in recommendation systems, addressing fundamental limitations in existing methodologies.

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to alleviate the challenge of analyzing and comparing vast collections of archaeological artifacts by leveraging advanced AI to assist expert reasoning.

Method: A dual-modal knowledge base is built from texts and images, enabling multimodal retrieval (visual, edge-enhanced, semantic) and structured inferences generated by a vision-language model.

Result: The system was tested on Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum and demonstrated the ability to generate meaningful, interpretable outputs helpful for experts.

Conclusion: The RAG-based system effectively supports expert analysis, reduces cognitive load, and provides actionable starting points for archaeological artifact provenance studies.

Abstract: In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system
for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert
reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models
(VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts
and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to
identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by
the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from
the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces
meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting
points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of
navigating vast comparative corpora.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the use of Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD) for recommender systems and introduces a new method, Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD), to address challenges in ranking distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from limitations of CE loss in KD for recommender systems, especially its conflict with the goal of distilling teacher rankings and maximizing NDCG on item subsets.

Method: The authors propose RCE-KD, splitting the teacher's top items into two subsets depending on the student's ranking, employing sampling strategies for problematic subsets, and combining subset losses adaptively.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCE-KD effectively bridges the gap between theoretical support for CE loss and the practical goal of KD, improving performance in knowledge distillation for recommender systems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that RCE-KD resolves the limitations of CE loss in KD and provides a more effective framework for ranking distillation, backed by theoretical insights and empirical results.

Abstract: This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces IntSR, a generative framework that integrates search and recommendation tasks, improving performance in multiple scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems unify retrieval and ranking but neglect the integration of search and recommendation tasks, which differ due to query formation.

Method: Proposed an integrated generative framework, IntSR, combining distinct query modalities for search and recommendation while addressing computational challenges and dynamic corpus errors.

Result: The deployment of IntSR led to significant performance improvements in applications, such as digital asset GMV (+3.02%), POI recommendation CTR (+2.76%), and travel mode ACC (+5.13%).

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates search and recommendation tasks, offering measurable benefits across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating
remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications.
However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking
while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What
makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search
uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user
interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to
whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as
central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R.
IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also
addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R
behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically
changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios
in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%),
POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

Motivation: Simulating turbulence is computationally expensive, and machine learning approaches can potentially alleviate this by super-resolving turbulent flows. However, ensuring physical symmetries like rotational equivariance poses a major challenge.

Method: The authors analyzed 3D channel-flow subdomains with varying anisotropy and tested if standard CNNs can learn rotational equivariance. They measured equivariance error across isotropic mid-plane and boundary layer data, as well as temporal and spatial sampling rates.

Result: CNNs partially acquire rotational symmetry naturally from turbulence. Mid-plane data and better sampling reduce equivariance error. Equivariance error's scale-dependence aligns with Kolmogorov's local isotropy hypothesis.

Conclusion: Rotational equivariance may not always need explicit integration into algorithms. Under certain conditions, turbulence itself offers symmetry, advancing efficient, symmetry-aware models for super-resolving turbulent flows.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use
of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central
challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as
rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or
specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational
augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with
differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane
data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer
data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error.
We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs
regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local
isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be
explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained
directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware
super-resolution.

### [449] [Recidivism and Peer Influence with LLM Text Embeddings in Low Security Correctional Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20634)
*Shanjukta Nath,Jiwon Hong,Jae Ho Chang,Keith Warren,Subhadeep Paul*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The study uses AI embeddings from written exchanges among low-security inmates, processed through a Large Language Model (LLM), to significantly improve recidivism predictions by 30% over traditional methods. Zero-Shot classification is employed for interpretability and peer effects in language usage are analyzed with new methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding human behavior and language patterns in correctional facilities can provide valuable insights into recidivism rates and the influence of social dynamics.

Method: AI embeddings were generated using a pre-trained LLM on written interactions among inmates. Zero-Shot classification was applied for interpretability. Peer effects were estimated using a novel multivariate peer effect model accounting for network endogeneity and sparse variables.

Result: Embedding techniques enhanced recidivism prediction accuracy by 30%. Significant peer effects in language usage for interaction and feedback were identified, showing the influence of social dynamics.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of LLM-based embeddings in better understanding inmate behavior and recidivism, alongside developing innovative methodologies for analyzing peer effects in sparse networks.

Abstract: We find AI embeddings obtained using a pre-trained transformer-based Large
Language Model (LLM) of 80,000-120,000 written affirmations and correction
exchanges among residents in low-security correctional facilities to be highly
predictive of recidivism. The prediction accuracy is 30\% higher with embedding
vectors than with only pre-entry covariates. However, since the text embedding
vectors are high-dimensional, we perform Zero-Shot classification of these
texts to a low-dimensional vector of user-defined classes to aid interpretation
while retaining the predictive power. To shed light on the social dynamics
inside the correctional facilities, we estimate peer effects in these
LLM-generated numerical representations of language with a multivariate peer
effect model, adjusting for network endogeneity. We develop new methodology and
theory for peer effect estimation that accommodate sparse networks,
multivariate latent variables, and correlated multivariate outcomes. With these
new methods, we find significant peer effects in language usage for interaction
and feedback.

*Binod Singh,Sayan Deb Sarkar,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SGAligner++ improves 3D scene graph alignment with a cross-modal framework using joint embedding for better performance in noisy and low-overlap situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the difficulty of 3D scene graph alignment, especially under partial overlap and noise with existing single-modality approaches.

Method: The proposed method uses language-aided learning, unimodal encoders, attention-based fusion, and joint embedding for cross-modal alignment.

Result: SGAligner++ showed up to 40% improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in noisy real-world environments, with enhanced cross-modal capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the SGAligner++ framework significantly boosts scene understanding across various tasks while maintaining scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,
language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the
challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

*Yandan Yang,Baoxiong Jia,Shujie Zhang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SceneWeaver is a framework for generating realistic and diverse indoor scenes by iteratively refining them using a language model-based planner and various scene generation tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in existing indoor 3D scene synthesis methods, such as fixed scene categories, lack of object-level detail, physical inconsistency, and inability to handle complex user instructions, especially for Embodied AI applications.

Method: SceneWeaver employs a closed-loop design of reason-act-reflect. A language model-based planner selects from tools like generative models and evaluates the scene's physical plausibility, realism, and semantic alignment. The agent iteratively improves the scene based on self-evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated that SceneWeaver outperforms prior methods across physical, visual, and semantic metrics. It successfully generalizes to complex scenes with diverse user instructions.

Conclusion: SceneWeaver marks a significant advancement toward creating general-purpose 3D environments, offering improvements in realism, diversity, and alignment with user specifications.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

*Yuguang Chen,Xinhai Liu,Yang Li,Victor Cheung,Zhuo Chen,Dongyu Zhang,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ArtUV introduces a fully automated method for artist-style UV unwrapping in computer graphics, solving issues like fragmentation and semantic incoherence through a novel two-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of existing UV unwrapping methods, which are inefficient, fragmented, and lack semantic coherence, making them impractical for artist-style UV mapping.

Method: ArtUV employs a two-stage process: SeamGPT predicts semantically meaningful cutting seams during seam prediction, and an Auto-Encoder refines an optimization-based rough UV map into artist-style UV parameterization.

Result: ArtUV achieves high semantic consistency and topological integrity in UV maps, enabling 2D editing and high-quality UV generation, with evaluations showing versatility across benchmarks.

Conclusion: ArtUV provides an automated, efficient, artist-centric solution ideal for rapid UV mapping while maintaining professional standards such as semantic coherence and minimal distortion.

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

*Duoteng Xu,Yuguang Chen,Jing Li,Xinhai Liu,Xueqi Ma,Zhuo Chen,Dongyu Zhang,Chunchao Guo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces SeamCrafter, a GPT-based model to generate 3D surface seams with reduced distortion and fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of poorly placed seams in 3D UV parametrization leading to UV distortion and excessive fragmentation.

Method: SeamCrafter uses a dual-branch GPT-based encoder for geometric and topological cues, fine-tuned using Direct Preference Optimization on a seam evaluation framework.

Result: The model achieves lower distortion and fragmentation while maintaining topological consistency and visual quality, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SeamCrafter provides an improved approach for generating high-quality seams in 3D surfaces, optimizing both technical and visual parameters.

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

*Jiabao Lei,Kewei Shi,Zhihao Liang,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for generating 3D meshes progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner using an auto-regressive (AR) transformer-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR models construct 3D meshes in lexicographic order, which can fail to align with human perceptions of geometry. The authors aim to refine this approach by mimicking practices from 2D image generation processes.

Method: The authors propose a progressive AR model that uses mesh simplification algorithms in reverse. Their transformer-based model gradually refines a mesh from a single point, adding geometric details without predefined topology.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method offers control over generation quality and computational time, while enabling additional applications like mesh refinement and editing.

Conclusion: The approach introduces a more intuitive method for 3D mesh generation, improving flexibility and expanding potential practical applications in areas like refinement and editing.

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ArchGPT is introduced as a multimodal architectural visual question answering (VQA) system, supported by a scalable pipeline that creates Arch-300K, a dataset of over 315,000 architectural image-question-answer triplets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the accessibility and scalability of VR/AR/MR tools in understanding architecture by addressing limitations in existing systems, which rely on hard-coded annotations and are not versatile for diverse environments.

Method: ArchGPT integrates a multimodal VQA model with a scalable framework that filters and curates architectural images, verifies textual metadata using LLM-guided processes, and synthesizes detailed architectural annotations.

Result: The research achieves ArchGPT, a fine-tuned multimodal model trained on the Arch-300K dataset, which embodies structured and reliable architectural annotations for advanced VQA capabilities.

Conclusion: ArchGPT and its accompanying dataset provide a scalable solution for immersive, architecture-focused applications, aiding in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practices.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

*Christian Stippel,Felix Mujkanovic,Thomas Leimkühler,Pedro Hermosilla*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel method for converting neural implicit functions to polygonal meshes with high accuracy and efficiency, overcoming limitations of conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate surface geometry representation in 3D computing is vital, but current methods for extracting surfaces from implicit representations, like Marching Cubes, suffer from resolution-related inaccuracies.

Method: The method extracts surfaces analytically from neural implicit functions by using a depth-first traversal strategy that leverages how neurons partition the space. The approach operates in parallel and accommodates large neural architectures.

Result: The proposed method achieves unprecedented geometric accuracy across various shapes and neural architectures while maintaining comparable processing speed to traditional methods.

Conclusion: This method improves upon conventional surface extraction techniques by eliminating spatial discretization and delivering precise conversion results efficiently, marking significant progress in 3D visual computing.

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

*Yuze He,Yanning Zhou,Wang Zhao,Jingwen Ye,Yushi Bai,Kaiwen Xiao,Yong-Jin Liu,Zhongqian Sun,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHARM, a new framework for modeling anime hairstyles with a novel, compact parametric representation and generative approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hair modeling methods struggle with anime hairstyles due to their stylized and piecewise geometry. Current approaches rely on dense meshes or handcrafted curves, making them inefficient and not scalable for learning-based methods.

Method: CHARM uses a compact control-point-based parameterization (five parameters per control point for each hair card) combined with an autoregressive generative framework employing a transformer to sequentially model anime hairstyles as a 'hair language.'

Result: CHARM demonstrates state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and generation quality and supports efficient, artist-friendly design and learning-based generation of anime hairstyles.

Conclusion: CHARM offers a scalable and expressive solution for anime hairstyle modeling, paired with a large-scale dataset, AnimeHair, to support training and evaluation.

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system that uses large language models (LLMs) for natural language-based network management, making it more accessible to non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Network management traditionally requires significant technical expertise, creating barriers for non-experts to manage networks efficiently.

Method: The authors propose an agentic framework leveraging LLMs, with features such as intermediate representation for diverse equipment, real-time memory-based state retrieval, and external feedback interfaces. They also conduct pilot studies and develop a visualization tool for dialogue-driven interaction.

Result: Preliminary experiments using synthetic and real user utterances validate the effectiveness of the proposed system components with LLM integration.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a pathway to democratizing network management, enabling non-experts to manage networks using conversational interfaces powered by LLMs.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a
handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge.
This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without
resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models
(LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network
management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to
converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage
advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate
representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment,
retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface
for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data
of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization
interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale
data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both
synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and
visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and
democratize network control for everyday users.

Motivation: To tackle critical trust challenges in information transmission, semantics, and entity reliability in vehicular semantic communication networks.

Method: The proposed architecture includes semantic camouflage, robust federated encoder-decoder training, and audit game-based trust management mechanisms.

Result: Validated effectiveness through a case study and identified key research directions for future exploration.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions advance the reliability and security of vehicular semantic communication networks.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has the potential to significantly reduce

innovative three-layer trustworthy VN-SemComNet architecture. Specifically, we
introduce a semantic camouflage transmission mechanism leveraging defensive
adversarial noise for active eavesdropping defense, a robust federated
encoder-decoder training framework to mitigate encoder-decoder poisoning
attacks, and an audit game-based distributed vehicle trust management mechanism
to deter untrustworthy vehicles. A case study validates the effectiveness of
the proposed solutions. Lastly, essential future research directions are

*Murat Arda Onsu,Poonam Lohan,Burak Kantarci,Aisha Syed,Matthew Andrews,Sean Kennedy*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semantic communication framework for real-time urban traffic surveillance that combines edge device processing, Vision Transformers, and cloud-based multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), reducing data transmission size by 99.9% while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of implementing real-time traffic monitoring using LLMs in smart cities, which is hindered by the computational limitations of edge devices and limited data transmission bandwidth between edge and cloud systems.

Method: The method involves detecting Regions of Interest (ROIs) using YOLOv11, encoding these regions as compact embedding vectors with a Vision Transformer (ViT), transmitting these vectors to the cloud, reconstructing the images, and then generating traffic descriptions using a multimodal LLM.

Result: The proposed approach reduces data transmission size by 99.9%, while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed images, as compared to 93% accuracy for original cropped images.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of combining ViT and LLM for edge-cloud semantic communication, providing a scalable solution for real-time urban traffic monitoring with significant data efficiency.

Abstract: Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle
trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras
across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road
conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a
robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface
for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can
interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment
on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM
inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from
edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential
delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we
propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces
transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs)
using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into
compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings
are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the
cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to
generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9%
reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy
of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original
cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT
and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic
surveillance.

*Kai Zhang,Corey D Barrett,Jangwon Kim,Lichao Sun,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RadAgents is a multi-agent framework for chest X-ray interpretation designed to improve reliability, clinical interpretability, visual grounding, and consistency by integrating clinical priors, multimodal reasoning, and conflict resolution mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for chest X-ray interpretation face three key issues: lack of clinically interpretable reasoning, insufficient fusion of multimodal evidence, and the inability to address cross-tool inconsistencies.

Method: RadAgents employs a multi-agent framework that combines clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning, grounding, and multimodal retrieval-augmentation processes to ensure accurate and guideline-consistent outputs.

Result: RadAgents enhances the reliability and transparency of CXR interpretation by resolving context conflicts and aligning outputs more closely with clinical practices.

Conclusion: RadAgents addresses critical gaps in current X-ray diagnostic systems, offering a more consistent and clinically trustworthy approach through its advanced reasoning and verification framework.

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

*Kevin Bradley Dsouza,Graham Alexander Watt,Yuri Leonenko,Juan Moreno-Cruz*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts complex collective action problems into well-structured problems for individual agents by discovering heuristics and persuasive rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of collective action problems where aligning individual decisions with global goals is complex due to unclear causal links and conflicting stakeholder objectives.

Method: The ECHO-MIMIC framework operates in two stages: ECHO evolves Python code snippets to represent behavioral policies, and MIMIC tailors natural language messages to encourage agents to adopt these policies. Both stages use a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search process.

Result: ECHO-MIMIC outperforms baselines by discovering high-quality agent heuristics in an agricultural landscape simulation and creates effective messages that align individuals' decisions with ecological goals.

Conclusion: By integrating algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC reduces the cognitive burden of collective action, making previously unsolvable problems tractable and opening opportunities for scalable policy design.

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with
collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For
an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes
are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear
algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present
ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into
a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering
compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework
operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from
Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral
policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for
Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages
that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a
large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and
context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains
those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We
demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape
management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological
connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics
compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align
simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling
algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms
the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level
instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice
and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

### [463] [Actively Learning Halfspaces without Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20848)
*Hadley Black,Kasper Green Larsen,Arya Mazumdar,Barna Saha,Geelon So*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper addresses the point location problem for learning halfspaces without relying on point synthesis. It achieves optimal query bounds ($\Theta(D + \log n)$) by leveraging structure in orderings for efficient binary search, extending results to PAC-learning scenarios with adversarial noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design efficient algorithms to learn halfspaces without requiring point synthesis, overcoming the $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound for this setting.

Method: The authors constrain normal vectors to a finite-sized set ($|D|$), enabling efficient parallelized binary search across orderings. They also adapt the algorithm for PAC-learning under adversarial corruption.

Result: The paper demonstrates tight query bounds ($\Theta(D + \log n)$), closes the gap for axis-aligned halfspaces ($O(d + \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$), and achieves nearly-optimal bounds for PAC-learning in corrupted settings.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms are more query-efficient in learning halfspaces and Boolean functions in structured settings, making significant theoretical progress and offering practical relevance for adversarial learning setups.

Abstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X
\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace
$f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every
point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal
$\widetilde{O}(d \log n)$ query algorithm is known due to
Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted
the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in
fact without this power there is an $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to
Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).
  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning
halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound,
we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size
$D$, and show tight bounds of $\Theta(D + \log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain
an optimal $O(d + \log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned
halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$.
In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean
function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$
provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these
orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each
ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.
  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal
algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\min(D + \log(1/\varepsilon),
1/\varepsilon) \cdot \log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error
$\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a
$c\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This
bound is optimal up to a $\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting.

*Huaze Tang,Tianren Peng,Shao-lun Huang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper explores concept-based in-context learning (CB-ICL), providing theoretical insights into why it works and validating it with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of theoretical understanding of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on CB-ICL.

Method: Theoretical analysis quantifies knowledge leveraged by LLMs, introduces a similarity measure for prompts and queries, and investigates the effects of prompt size and embedding dimension.

Result: Theoretical findings provide insights into pre-training, prompt engineering, and the applicability of CB-ICL, supported by validation through real-data experiments.

Conclusion: CB-ICL is effective for query-label predictions, offers guidance for LLM training and prompt crafting, with supportive empirical evidence.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like application development, portability, and reproducibility in quantum computing, while supporting hybrid quantum workflows in HPC environments.

Method: The authors propose middleware capable of advanced scheduling, observability, and admin functionality, leveraging a vendor-neutral Quantum Resource Management Interface (QRMI).

Result: Provides a runtime environment that improves QPU utilization, supports multiple SDKs, and offers enhanced monitoring capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture facilitates robust and modular hybrid quantum computing while improving performance and resource management in HPC environments.

Abstract: Robust execution environments are important for addressing key challenges in
quantum computing, such as application development, portability, and
reproducibility, and help unlock the development of modular quantum programs,
driving forward hybrid quantum workflows. In this work, we show progress
towards a basic, but portable, runtime environment for developing and executing
hybrid quantum-classical programs running in High Performance Computing (HPC)
environments enhanced with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The middleware
includes a second layer of scheduling after the main HPC resource manager in
order to improve the utilization of the QPU, and extra functionality for
observability, monitoring, and admin access. This approach enables managing
multiple programming Software Development Kits (SDKs) as first-class citizens
in the environment by building on a recently proposed vendor-neutral Quantum
Resource Management Interface (QRMI). Lastly, we discuss and show a solution
for the monitoring and observability stack, completing our description of the
hybrid system architecture.

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to efficiently predict variational quantum algorithm (VQA) parameter updates, reducing quantum resource costs by up to 90%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the prohibitive quantum resource costs associated with applying VQAs to large-scale tasks, which stem from restrictions like the no-cloning theorem preventing standard backpropagation.

Method: They reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and use PINNs to efficiently model and predict parameter updates leveraging limited quantum trajectory data on classical systems.

Result: The approach achieves a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by up to 90% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method complements existing methods for improving VQA efficiency and enhances their potential for practical near-term applications on quantum devices.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach
practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning
theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to
prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To
address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a
nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that
leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical
system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected
from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over
multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum
resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that
our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and
reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40
qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques
aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their
potential for practical applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces VITA, a platform using large language models to support data science education through conversational AI, analytics, and adaptive learning pathways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability issues in traditional instruction and enhance workforce preparation through AI-driven personalized education.

Method: Uses a chatbot integrated with context-aware tutoring, adaptive pathways, and formative assessments backed by an analytics pipeline.

Result: Provides a reusable architecture for conversational analytics, integrity-preserving assessments, and benchmarks against other tutoring systems.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential for conversational AI in personalized learning, while outlining lessons, challenges, and future development directions.

Abstract: This paper presents VITA (Virtual Teaching Assistants), an adaptive
distributed learning (ADL) platform that embeds a large language model
(LLM)-powered chatbot (BotCaptain) to provide dialogic support, interoperable
analytics, and integrity-aware assessment for workforce preparation in data
science. The platform couples context-aware conversational tutoring with
formative-assessment patterns designed to promote reflective reasoning. The
paper describes an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms chat logs into
Experience API (xAPI) statements, instructor dashboards that surface outliers
for just-in-time intervention, and an adaptive pathway engine that routes
learners among progression, reinforcement, and remediation content. The paper
also benchmarks VITA conceptually against emerging tutoring architectures,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)--based assistants and Learning
Tools Interoperability (LTI)--integrated hubs, highlighting trade-offs among
content grounding, interoperability, and deployment complexity. Contributions
include a reusable architecture for interoperable conversational analytics, a
catalog of patterns for integrity-preserving formative assessment, and a
practical blueprint for integrating adaptive pathways into data-science
courses. The paper concludes with implementation lessons and a roadmap (RAG
integration, hallucination mitigation, and LTI~1.3 / OpenID Connect) to guide
multi-course evaluations and broader adoption. In light of growing demand and
scalability constraints in traditional instruction, the approach illustrates
how conversational AI can support engagement, timely feedback, and personalized
learning at scale. Future work will refine the platform's adaptive intelligence
and examine applicability across varied educational settings.

*Caleb DeLeeuw,Gaurav Chawla,Aniket Sharma,Vanessa Dietze*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper explores strategic deception in large language models using experiments like "Secret Agenda" and "Insider Trading" compliance tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and address deceptive behavior in language models and improve detection and risk assessment.

Method: Using autolabeling of deception features and visual tools like heatmaps and t-SNE for identifying patterns in model behavior.

Result: Autolabel-driven approaches failed to identify and control lying, but unlabeled activations revealed useful patterns.

Conclusion: Traditional interpretability tools are ineffective for deception detection, while unlabeled activations offer promising risk assessment insights, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two
complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading
compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when
deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis
revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during
strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+
deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading
analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant
responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations.
These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to
detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations
provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama
8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints,
representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature
discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic
deception contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack mechanisms for consistent, transparent communication of safety and security throughout their lifecycle.

Method: HASC enhances traditional model cards by including safety and security details alongside standardized identifiers like AI Safety Hazard (ASH) IDs.

Result: The proposed system enables clear communication of AI flaws and complements standards like ISO/IEC 42001:2023.

Conclusion: HASC provides a robust way to improve transparency, accountability, and informed decision-making in AI system development and deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of regional conflict on press freedom and media focus in an emerging democracy like Pakistan.

Method: Analyzed around 2,600 articles from three major Pakistani newspapers using a large language model (LLM).

Result: War-related reporting dominated, sidelining coverage of political opposition and dissent.

Conclusion: Conflicts can marginalize democratic discourse, emphasizing the need to protect press freedoms in unstable regions.

Abstract: Democracies rely on opposition and dissent to function, but in emerging
democracies, freedom of speech is often restricted. This effect intensifies
during regional conflicts. This study examines how the India-Pakistan conflict
of May 2025 influenced Pakistani media coverage. Analyzing approximately 2,600
news articles from three major newspapers using a large language model (LLM),
the study found that war-related reporting significantly overshadowed coverage
of political opposition and dissent. These findings highlight how conflict can
marginalize democratic discourse, reinforcing the need to safeguard press

TL;DR: The paper develops variant-level embeddings for genomic data using LLMs and demonstrates their utility in applications like genetic risk prediction and hypothesis testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current genomic applications using LLM embeddings are limited to gene-level data. Extending this to variant-level data enables deeper insights into biological information.

Method: Semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion variants were built and embedded using OpenAI's and Qwen models, followed by baseline experiments for validation.

Result: High predictive accuracy for genomic properties was demonstrated, validating these embeddings. Two applications—genetic risk prediction and hypothesis testing—were outlined.

Conclusion: The embeddings successfully capture genomic variation and offer significant potential for genomic research and precision medicine, with resources shared publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) embeddings have enabled
powerful representations for biological data, but most applications to date
focus only on gene-level information. We present one of the first systematic
frameworks to generate variant-level embeddings across the entire human genome.
Using curated annotations from FAVOR, ClinVar, and the GWAS Catalog, we
constructed semantic text descriptions for 8.9 billion possible variants and
generated embeddings at three scales: 1.5 million HapMap3+MEGA variants, ~90
million imputed UK Biobank variants, and ~9 billion all possible variants.
Embeddings were produced with both OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large and the
open-source Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B models. Baseline experiments demonstrate high
predictive accuracy for variant properties, validating the embeddings as
structured representations of genomic variation. We outline two downstream
applications: embedding-informed hypothesis testing by extending the
Frequentist And Bayesian framework to genome-wide association studies, and
embedding-augmented genetic risk prediction that enhances standard polygenic
risk scores. These resources, publicly available on Hugging Face, provide a
foundation for advancing large-scale genomic discovery and precision medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the axiomatic framework of Cartesian reverse differential categories to include higher-order reverse differentiation through an analogue of Faa di Bruno's Formula.

Method: The authors define partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives and use them to derive the higher-order reverse chain rule.

Result: The paper successfully formulates a reverse differential analogue of Faa di Bruno's Formula and integrates it within Cartesian reverse differential categories.

Conclusion: This work enriches the theory of Cartesian reverse differential categories by introducing higher-order operations, enhancing the expressive power and application scope of reverse differentiation.

Abstract: Reverse differentiation is an essential operation for automatic
differentiation. Cartesian reverse differential categories axiomatize reverse
differentiation in a categorical framework, where one of the primary axioms is
the reverse chain rule, which is the formula that expresses the reverse
derivative of a composition. Here, we present the reverse differential analogue
of Faa di Bruno's Formula, which gives a higher-order reverse chain rule in a
Cartesian reverse differential category. To properly do so, we also define
partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives in a Cartesian
reverse differential category.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper tackles the challenge of using external control data in Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for causal inference, proposing a refined doubly robust estimator that ensures improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address scenarios where external control data are available and integration could paradoxically reduce efficiency in causal inference models.

Method: The authors propose a novel doubly robust estimator that ensures higher efficiency even with model misspecifications and provides semiparametric efficiency when models are correctly specified.

Result: The proposed method guarantees better efficiency compared to standard methods and was validated using simulations and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Incorporating external controls through the novel doubly robust estimator can enhance efficiency and reliability in causal inference applications, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as the gold standard
for causal inference in biomedical research. For instance, when estimating the
average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), a doubly robust estimation
procedure can be applied, requiring either the propensity score model or the
control outcome model to be correctly specified. In this paper, we address
scenarios where external control data, often with a much larger sample size,
are available. Such data are typically easier to obtain from historical records
or third-party sources. However, we find that incorporating external controls
into the standard doubly robust estimator for ATT may paradoxically result in
reduced efficiency compared to using the estimator without external controls.
This counterintuitive outcome suggests that the naive incorporation of external
controls could be detrimental to estimation efficiency. To resolve this issue,
we propose a novel doubly robust estimator that guarantees higher efficiency
than the standard approach without external controls, even under model
misspecification. When all models are correctly specified, this estimator
aligns with the standard doubly robust estimator that incorporates external
controls and achieves semiparametric efficiency. The asymptotic theory
developed in this work applies to high-dimensional confounder settings, which
are increasingly common with the growing prevalence of electronic health record
data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through extensive
simulation studies and a real-world data application.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling time-dependent hydrodynamics in accretion disks, providing accurate, data-free solutions while overcoming limitations of traditional simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for simulating accretion disk dynamics rely on computationally expensive simulations, and they often encounter issues such as wave reflections at disk edges. The authors aim to explore PINNs as a more efficient and improved alternative.

Method: The authors applied PINNs to solve two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics equations of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. The PINNs were trained without data, relying solely on the governing physical laws, and allowed predictions at any time and spatial location within the training domain.

Result: The PINNs reproduced key physical phenomena, such as spiral density waves and gap formation, and eliminated the spurious wave reflections that traditional simulations struggle to overcome.

Conclusion: The study highlights PINNs as a promising machine learning-based, data-free modeling technique for complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional simulations of accretion disks.

Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse
environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally
intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains
neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the
first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide
solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and
successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and
propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion
interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally
eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging
to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced
machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of
complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to
traditional numerical simulations in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in modeling 2D turbulence to improve stability and accuracy in simulations.

Method: Combined AI techniques with fluid physics principles and sparse-equation discovery to derive a 4th-order closure model.

Result: Developed a closure that reproduced DNS statistics, including extremes, with accurate and stable LES.

Conclusion: Inter-scale energy transfer is crucial, enabling discovery of higher-order terms and stable turbulence modeling.

Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D
turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy
simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS
statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could
be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and
AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES.
The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered
alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.
