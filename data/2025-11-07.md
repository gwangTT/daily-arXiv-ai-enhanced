### [1] [Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03773)
*Zhaorun Chen,Zhuokai Zhao,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Qi Qi,Yifan Wu,Tarun Kalluri,Sara Cao,Yuanhao Xiong,Haibo Tong,Huaxiu Yao,Hengduo Li,Jiacheng Zhu,Xian Li,Dawn Song,Bo Li,Jason Weston,Dat Huynh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DreamGym, a framework aimed at synthesizing scalable experiences for reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome challenges like costly rollouts and unreliable reward signals. Experiments show it significantly boosts RL training efficiency while reducing reliance on real-world interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address key challenges in practical adoption of RL for large language models: costly environment rollouts, limited tasks, unreliable rewards, and infrastructure complexity, which hinder scalable data acquisition.

Method: DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model, employs an experience replay buffer with offline and fresh data, and generates adaptive tasks that challenge current policies for effective curriculum learning.

Result: DreamGym improves RL training in synthetic and sim-to-real settings, outperforming baselines in non-RL-ready tasks by over 30%, matching top performance in costly RL-ready environments, and enhancing real-world RL efficiency with fewer interactions.

Conclusion: DreamGym is a scalable framework for RL, enabling autonomous agents to train efficiently with synthetic experiences, bridging the gap between simulated and real-world environments, and paving the way for practical RL adoption.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

### [2] [How Different Tokenization Algorithms Impact LLMs and Transformer Models for Binary Code Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03825)
*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study evaluates various tokenization strategies for assembly code and their effects on intrinsic properties and downstream tasks like function signature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exploration aims to address the overlooked area of tokenization in assembly code analysis, which is crucial for improving semantic representation and downstream performance.

Method: The study systematically compares tokenization models and techniques using intrinsic evaluations like tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and representational fidelity, along with extrinsic evaluations such as performance on specific tasks using pre-trained NLP models.

Result: Findings suggest that tokenizer choice significantly affects performance in downstream tasks, and intrinsic metrics provide only partial predictability for external evaluations.

Conclusion: Insights from this study pave the way for optimizing tokenization models tailored to assembly code, enhancing the reliability and scalability of binary code analysis workflows using NLP approaches.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

*Tianning Dong,Luyi Ma,Varun Vasudevan,Jason Cho,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study introduces BehaviorLens, a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of textual and image modalities in MLLMs for user-behavior reasoning, finding that images significantly boost performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored area of modality effectiveness (text vs. image) in enhancing user-behavior reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.

Method: The authors benchmarked six MLLMs using a real-world dataset where transaction data was represented as text paragraphs, scatter plots, and flowcharts.

Result: MLLM accuracy for predicting next-purchase improved by 87.5% when employing image representations compared to textual ones, without any extra computational cost.

Conclusion: Image-based representations substantially enhance the capability of MLLMs in user-behavior reasoning tasks using real-world data, suggesting the importance of modality selection.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

### [4] [KnowThyself: An Agentic Assistant for LLM Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03878)
*Suraj Prasai,Mengnan Du,Ying Zhang,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowThyself is a conversational platform for improving LLM interpretability by consolidating tools and simplifying technical barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance LLM interpretability and overcome fragmentation and technical challenges in existing tools.

Method: Uses an orchestrator LLM to reformulate queries, an agent router for directing them, and modules for interactive visualizations and guided explanations.

Result: KnowThyself simplifies LLM inspection and makes interpretability more accessible via a chat-based interface.

Conclusion: By embedding interpretability processes into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself serves as a robust and extensible platform for LLM understanding.

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [5] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reevaluates the performance of Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), proposing that its success lies in modeling causal relationships between knowledge components (KCs) rather than bidirectional ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to refine the understanding of why DKT excels in predicting student performance and strengthen its application by focusing on causal structures.

Method: The study pruned exercise graphs to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and trained DKT on causal subsets of educational datasets, analyzing DKT's ability to model prerequisites.

Result: DKT's predictive performance aligns strongly with causal structures, indicating its ability to model prerequisite relationships rather than bidirectional dependencies.

Conclusion: DKT's strength is rooted in its approximation of causal dependencies, reshaping its perceived mechanisms and advancing explainable knowledge tracing.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [6] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to cultural values and the influence of prompt language and cultural framing on their outputs, finding that LLMs show systematic biases and limited representation of global cultural diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the concern that LLMs, while widely used globally, may not effectively represent the cultural diversity of their users due to imbalances in training data and optimization objectives.

Method: The researchers probed 10 LLMs using 63 items from Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and analyzed responses with and without cultural perspectives in prompts.

Result: The study found that prompt language and cultural perspective influence LLM outputs, but all models exhibit biases toward values associated with certain countries (Netherlands, Germany, US, Japan). Explicit cultural perspectives improved alignment, but combining language and cultural framing was ineffective.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate responsiveness to prompt variation but remain anchored to specific cultural biases, struggling to fully represent cultural diversity despite targeted steering approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

### [7] [ArchPilot: A Proxy-Guided Multi-Agent Approach for Machine Learning Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03985)
*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ArchPilot, a multi-agent system to optimize machine learning engineering processes by reducing computational overhead and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for ML engineering rely heavily on expensive and time-consuming full training runs for evaluating solutions, which limits scalability and efficiency.

Method: ArchPilot employs three specialized agents: an orchestration agent using Monte Carlo Tree Search-based strategies, a generation agent for architecture design, and an evaluation agent for proxy-based metrics.

Result: Experiments on the MLE-Bench platform show ArchPilot surpasses state-of-the-art systems like AIDE and ML-Master in performance.

Conclusion: ArchPilot is an effective solution for improving ML engineering efficiency, especially under limited computational budgets, through its integration of adaptive search and proxy-based evaluations.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

### [8] [Detecting Silent Failures in Multi-Agentic AI Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04032)
*Divya Pathak,Harshit Kumar,Anuska Roy,Felix George,Mudit Verma,Pratibha Moogi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of detecting silent failures such as drift and cycles in Multi-Agentic AI systems, and introduces systematic anomaly detection approaches using curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silent failures in Multi-Agentic AI systems are hard to detect and create reliability issues, motivating the need for systematic anomaly detection.

Method: The authors developed a dataset curation pipeline capturing diverse agentic behaviors and benchmarked anomaly detection methods, including supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches, on labeled datasets.

Result: Supervised and semi-supervised methods demonstrated high efficiency, achieving anomaly detection accuracies of up to 98% and 96%, respectively.

Conclusion: This study systematically addresses anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, providing datasets and benchmarks that will support further research in this area.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

### [9] [Interpreting Multi-Attribute Confounding through Numerical Attributes in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04053)
*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates numerical attributes in LLMs, showing underlying vulnerabilities in their representations and decision-making processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the latent representational mechanisms behind numerical reasoning errors in large language models, and improve control under multi-attribute entanglement.

Method: The authors combined linear probing, partial correlation analysis, and prompt vulnerability tests across LLMs of varying sizes.

Result: LLMs encode numerical correlations but amplify them, with irrelevant context disrupting magnitude representations, varying by model size.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in LLM decision-making processes and suggests foundations for improving fair and aware representation control.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [10] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentmandering introduces a turn-based negotiation framework for redistricting using large language model agents to reduce partisan bias and ensure fairness in district maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational methods for redistricting focus on generating valid plans but overlook partisan manipulation in map selection, which impacts fairness.

Method: The proposed framework involves turn-based negotiations where two agents, representing opposing political interests, select and freeze districts using a game-theoretic approach integrated with LLMs.

Result: Using post-2020 U.S. Census data, Agentmandering decreases partisan bias and unfairness significantly, with reduced variance compared to existing methods, especially in swing states.

Conclusion: Agentmandering achieves enhanced fairness and stability in the redistricting process compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

### [11] [KGFR: A Foundation Retriever for Generalized Knowledge Graph Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04093)
*Yuanning Cui,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu,Zhangjie Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLM-KGFR, a collaborative framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with a Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR) to enhance reasoning and scalability on unseen or large graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of improving LLMs in handling knowledge-intensive tasks by leveraging structured retrievers while avoiding dataset-specific fine-tuning and scalability issues.

Method: LLM-KGFR employs the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever with Asymmetric Progressive Propagation (APP) for controlled expansion of graph data and facilitates iterative reasoning by interfacing node-, edge-, and path-level data with LLMs.

Result: LLM-KGFR demonstrates effective reasoning, scalability, and zero-shot generalization on unseen knowledge graphs via experimental validation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines LLMs and structured retrievers to offer a scalable and generalizable solution for knowledge graph-augmented reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

*Miguel E. Andres,Vadim Fedorov,Rida Sadek,Enric Spagnolo-Arrizabalaga,Nadescha Trudel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework to evaluate the quality of Voice AI testing platforms through human-centered benchmarking. It highlights significant differences in platform performance and provides tools for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice AI agents are increasingly deployed for real-world interactions, but reliable testing methods remain underdeveloped, creating a measurement gap limiting scalability.

Method: The framework uses psychometric methodologies like Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence intervals, permutation tests, and statistical validation to assess simulation and evaluation quality of testing platforms.

Result: An empirical evaluation of three Voice AI testing platforms was conducted, revealing Evalion’s top performance in evaluation quality (0.92 F1-score vs 0.73 for others) and simulation quality (0.61 vs 0.43).

Conclusion: The proposed framework aids in rigorous validation and benchmarking of Voice AI testing platforms, ensuring scalable reliability and reproducibility.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [13] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates how empowerment-focused AI agents can cause disempowerment in multi-human settings and proposes potential remedies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to explore goal-agnostic AI objectives like empowerment and their impact in more realistic multi-human environments, as most prior studies focus on single-agent scenarios.

Method: The authors developed a test suite called Disempower-Grid, used to test reinforcement learning agents optimizing for human empowerment in multi-human environments.

Result: It was discovered that AI agents optimizing for one human's empowerment often disempower other humans. Joint empowerment was shown to mitigate this, but at the cost of individual user rewards.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential misalignment of goal-agnostic objectives, like empowerment, in multi-agent settings and underscores the importance of addressing these challenges in AI alignment research.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

### [14] [Opus: A Quantitative Framework for Workflow Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04220)
*Alan Seroul,Théo Fagnoni,Inès Adnani,Dana O. Mohamed,Phillip Kingston*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework to quantify Workflow quality and efficiency using probabilistic and normative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a comprehensive and measurable way to evaluate and optimize Workflow performance in automation systems.

Method: The framework combines probabilistic functions for expected performance (Opus Workflow Reward) and measurable penalties on structural and informational characteristics (Opus Workflow Normative Penalties). Workflows are assessed and optimized under a unified Reward-Penalty trade-off.

Result: The framework integrates structural, semantic, and signal-related factors into one model, enabling Workflow ranking, evaluation, and optimization, with possible applications in reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: This framework creates a mathematical and practical basis for improving Workflow quality and efficiency, fostering advancements in automation systems and their optimization.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for enhancing coordination in multi-agent systems by reducing mutual uncertainty, incorporating self-localization, bandwidth efficiency, and social place-cell-like neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent spatial memory in multi-agent systems under conditions of limited observability and bandwidth, which can cause failures in coordination.

Method: The paper proposes a predictive coding framework formulated as an information bottleneck objective, enabling agents to decide communication timing and content based on grid-cell-like metrics for internal spatial coding.

Result: The framework demonstrates resilience to bandwidth constraints on the Memory-Maze benchmark, maintaining higher success rates (e.g., from 73.5% at 128 bits/step to 64.4% at 4 bits/step), compared to traditional methods that collapse under low bandwidth.

Conclusion: The findings present a biologically plausible foundation for the emergence of complex social representations in multi-agent systems, fostering collective social intelligence through predictive coordination mechanics.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

### [16] [RLoop: An Self-Improving Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Iterative Policy Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04285)
*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies a critical challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning models—overfitting—and introduces RLoop, a framework that iteratively refines policies to improve generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address RL overfitting caused by policy over-specialization and forgetting diverse solutions during training, thereby limiting model generalization.

Method: The authors present RLoop, a self-improving framework leveraging iterative policy initialization and Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This approach creates expert datasets from successful trajectories and refines starting policies for improved subsequent iterations.

Result: RLoop significantly mitigates policy forgetting and enhances generalization performance, achieving a 9% average accuracy boost and over 15% improvement in pass@32 compared to standard RL.

Conclusion: RLoop transforms RL training dynamics into a virtuous cycle, converting transient policy variations into durable improvements, effectively addressing RL overfitting while improving reasoning model accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

TL;DR: GUI-360$^\circ$ presents a dataset to improve computer-using agents with over 1.2M action steps and benchmarks on real-world Windows applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent challenges in CUAs, such as the absence of real-world tasks, automated pipelines, and unified benchmarks.

Method: Developed an LLM-augmented pipeline for automated task creation, batched execution, and quality filtering across multi-modal data.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant shortcomings in grounding and action prediction, requiring fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for improved performance.

Conclusion: GUI-360$^\circ$ offers a comprehensive resource for enhancing CUAs, fostering research with its dataset and benchmark suite.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper critiques the use of probe accuracy for measuring concept alignment in explainable AI, introducing methods and metrics for better identifying and mitigating misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the shortcomings of current explainable AI methods where probe accuracy is wrongly assumed as a reliable measure for concept representation.

Method: Introduced spatial linear attribution for concept localization and proposed three metrics: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness to assess concept alignment.

Result: Identified that probes often exploit spurious correlations, even achieving high accuracy despite misalignment. Proposed methods improve alignment through improved translation invariance and spatial alignment.

Conclusion: Probe accuracy is inadequate for assessing concept alignment. Proper metrics and tailored approaches to probes are necessary to ensure faithful representation of intended concepts.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research on LLM safety and robustness lacks standardization, leading to fragmentation and challenges in reproducibility and comparability.

Method: AdversariaLLM incorporates 12 adversarial attack algorithms, 7 benchmark datasets, and open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face, with features like compute-resource tracking and deterministic results.

Result: The toolbox provides a comprehensive framework for conducting standardized research on LLM robustness and integrates a companion judging package, JudgeZoo.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM aims to establish a foundation for transparent, reproducible, and comparable studies in the field of LLM safety.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.

*Jiahao Zhao,Luxin Xu,Minghuan Tan,Lichao Zhang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents RxSafeBench, a framework that evaluates medication safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) using simulated clinical consultations and a dedicated database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown excellent progress in healthcare tasks, but their ability to ensure medication safety in realistic clinical settings remains underexplored due to limitations in real-world datasets and evaluations.

Method: The authors created RxRisk DB containing diverse medication risks and developed RxSafeBench with high-quality consultation scenarios to systematically assess LLMs using structured multiple choice questions.

Result: Current LLMs struggle with medication safety, particularly in handling implied risks, and require better prompting and task-specific tuning for reliability.

Conclusion: RxSafeBench provides a valuable benchmark for advancing safer AI-driven clinical decision support and highlights areas for improvement in medication safety within LLMs.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

### [21] [Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV):Formalising Metacognitive Theory for Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04341)
*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework to enhance reasoning architectures by integrating metacognitive monitoring before generation to address architectural gaps and improve outcome accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations in current reasoning models, such as the Generate-Verify paradigm, which lack monitoring processes leading to suboptimal reasoning and reduced accuracy.

Method: The paper formalizes metacognitive theories into computational frameworks to introduce explicit monitoring before generation and iterative refinement using verification feedback.

Result: While no empirical validation is presented, the paper provides a theoretical understanding and systematic computational approach to improve reasoning accuracy and address system failures.

Conclusion: The paper contributes the MGV framework as a significant architectural enhancement, proposing metacognitive monitoring for reasoning systems, and suggesting future interventions for reasoning design without experimental validation.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

### [22] [Post-Training LLMs as Better Decision-Making Agents: A Regret-Minimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04393)
*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Iterative Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a method to enhance decision-making abilities of large language models (LLMs) by minimizing regret through iterative self-tuning and natural-language training signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models, originally designed for language tasks, often struggle with decision-making problems, especially in achieving low regret or balancing exploration-exploitation in dynamic environments.

Method: The proposed Iterative RMFT process involves iteratively generating decision trajectories, selecting low-regret examples, and fine-tuning the base model on these examples without relying on external decision-making algorithms or rigid templates.

Result: Iterative RMFT improves the decision-making performance of LLMs across different models and tasks by leveraging flexible, model-generated reasoning mechanisms.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust, flexible, and theoretically sound post-training framework, significantly enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities across varied scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

### [23] [The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439)
*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO addresses GRPO's limitations by introducing an adaptive baseline for RL training, ensuring failed solutions aren't positively reinforced and enhancing LLM adaptation via richer feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve GRPO by introducing richer forms of feedback rather than relying on binary feedback, ultimately helping LLMs gain genuinely new capabilities.

Method: CoRPO replaces GRPO's group-average baseline with an adaptive one, enforcing a minimum quality threshold for failed solutions, then transitioning to relative preference optimization to pursue optimal solutions.

Result: CoRPO outperforms GRPO in a code verification task, showcasing stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The paper presents CoRPO as a critical advancement, enabling LLMs to learn from richer feedback formats, fostering their ability to acquire new skillsets through reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAVe, a system combining classical routing with LLM-based reasoning for personalized urban mobility with 88% initial route selection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional vehicle routing systems in interpreting human drivers' complex and dynamic contexts.

Method: A hybrid system employing a multi-objective Dijkstra algorithm integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent for contextual route reasoning.

Result: PAVe demonstrated over 88% accuracy in initial route selection in realistic urban scenarios by incorporating user intents and contextual modifications.

Conclusion: Merging classical routing algorithms with LLM-based semantic reasoning provides an effective, personalized, adaptive, and scalable solution for urban mobility challenges.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the energy and CO2 costs tied to web agents, demonstrating the trade-offs between energy usage and performance, and emphasizing the need for energy transparency and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the largely unexplored sustainability issues in web agent research, despite their growing presence and powerful capabilities.

Method: The paper combines theoretical estimations and empirical benchmarking to analyze the energy consumption related to various web agent design philosophies.

Result: Reveals that different approaches in web agent creation significantly affect energy usage, and more energy consumption does not necessarily imply better outcomes. It also identifies transparency gaps in disclosing model parameters and processes.

Conclusion: The research underscores the need for a shift in evaluating web agents, advocating for metrics dedicated to measuring energy consumption in benchmarks for improved sustainability.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study introduces a framework to evaluate how well open-source LLMs simulate human decision-making in game-theoretic scenarios, finding varying abilities among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how closely large language models (LLMs) mirror human decision-making, which is critical for avoiding harmful outcomes and improving simulations for social and behavioral studies.

Method: Developed a digital twin for game-theoretic experiments and introduced a prompting/probing framework to evaluate machine decision-making behavior. Three models were tested: Llama, Mistral, and Qwen.

Result: Llama effectively reproduced human cooperation patterns, aligning with deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen adhered more to Nash equilibrium predictions. Behavioral replication at the population level was achieved without persona-based prompts.

Conclusion: Appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate human behavioral patterns, enabling new predictions in social decision-making and complementing traditional research approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework for optimizing sensor placement and reconstructing peak flowrates in urban stormwater systems under limited resources. Validated through a case study, it achieves high reconstruction accuracy with minimal sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing challenge of urban flooding caused by intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems, and the need for efficient monitoring and prediction under resource constraints.

Method: The DSS framework integrates EPA-SWMM for simulating stormwater network flowprofiles, applies singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR factorization for optimal sensor placement, and validates its performance through reconstruction accuracy tests.

Result: Using data from 77 nodes in a stormwater catchment, three optimally placed sensors reconstructed peak flowrates effectively, achieving high Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values (0.92-0.95). The model also demonstrated robustness to measurement uncertainty and sensor failures.

Conclusion: The proposed DSS framework provides a computationally efficient and interpretable solution for reconstructing flow conditions with minimal sensors. Its integration with predictive models can enhance flood early warning and real-time control capabilities under resource limitations.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to classify natural language queries into cooperative and uncooperative, advocating for handling ambiguities collaboratively rather than as deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguities in natural language interfaces to tabular data pose challenges, but the authors aim to reframe ambiguity as an opportunity for cooperative resolution.

Method: A principled framework was developed to distinguish and analyze cooperative and uncooperative queries across evaluations of tabular data interfaces.

Result: Analysis of 15 popular tabular question-answering datasets revealed a mix of query types that hinder accurate system evaluation.

Conclusion: By embracing cooperation in resolving ambiguities, the paper challenges traditional views and proposes directions to improve natural language interfaces for data querying.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

### [30] [Question the Questions: Auditing Representation in Online Deliberative Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04588)
*Soham De,Lodewijk Gelauff,Ashish Goel,Smitha Milli,Ariel Procaccia,Alice Siu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an auditing framework to measure the representativeness of questions chosen for deliberative processes using justified representation concepts, presenting efficient algorithms and comparing methods including moderator selection, ILP, and LLM-derived questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deliberative processes often face challenges in selecting representative questions for expert panels due to time constraints and the need for diverse participant representation.

Method: The paper presents auditing algorithms for justified representation in the general utility setting, applies them to historical deliberations using different selection methods, and integrates these tools into a deliberation platform.

Result: Efficient auditing algorithms were developed, showing promising results in analyzing representativeness of deliberation questions, and LLMs showed potential albeit with current limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance the representativeness of questions in deliberative processes and simplify auditing for future practical implementations worldwide.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

### [31] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR. WELL, a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning that uses symbolic reasoning and independent plan execution to improve coordination and task efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative multi-agent planning often fails at the trajectory level due to timing or movement deviations. The paper proposes raising the abstraction level to improve synchronization and efficiency.

Method: DR. WELL employs a two-phase negotiation protocol where agents propose roles and commit to joint action plans. Each agent independently executes symbolic plans within constraints. A shared world model updates the state as agents act.

Result: Experimental results show that DR. WELL improves task completion rates and efficiency by leveraging a dynamic world model, negotiation, and symbolic reasoning on cooperative block-push tasks.

Conclusion: By utilizing symbolic reasoning and a shared dynamic model, agents demonstrate better adaptation, synchronized collaboration, and reusable planning strategies, trading some time overhead for efficiency gains.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VeriCoT, a neuro-symbolic method to ensure logical validity of large language models' multi-step reasoning by verifying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs using formal logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with verifying their own reasoning logic, even in cases where they produce correct answers. This poses challenges of trustworthiness, particularly in critical applications.

Method: The authors propose VeriCoT, which converts each step of CoT reasoning into first-order logic and grounds arguments in source context, commonsense knowledge, or prior steps. VeriCoT uses automated solvers for formal verification and allows human and system interpretability of flawed reasoning.

Result: VeriCoT successfully identifies flawed reasoning in multi-step tasks across datasets (ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ). It also acts as a strong predictor of final answer correctness, enhancing reasoning validity and accuracy when integrated into inference-time self-reflection and fine-tuning strategies.

Conclusion: VeriCoT improves reasoning reliability in LLMs by formalizing CoT steps for better interpretability, logical verification, and performance enhancement via fine-tuning methodologies.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.

### [33] [From Minutes to Seconds: Redefining the Five-Minute Rule for AI-Era Memory Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03944)
*Tong Zhang,Vikram Sharma Mailthody,Fei Sun,Linsen Ma,Chris J. Newburn,Teresa Zhang,Yang Liu,Jiangpeng Li,Hao Zhong,Wen-Mei Hwu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper revisits the five-minute rule and modernizes it by considering host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and physics-grounded SSD performance/cost models, proposing a new provisioning framework for AI platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The classical five-minute rule ignored crucial modern considerations like host economics, workload behavior, and feasibility limits, which are important for optimizing memory hierarchy in current AI systems.

Method: The paper integrates factors such as host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, SSD performance metrics, and an updated modeling framework, along with introducing MQSim-Next—a validated SSD simulator—to enable analysis, validation, and impactful case studies.

Result: The study finds that the traditional DRAM-to-flash caching threshold shifts from minutes to seconds for high-performance AI platforms, suggesting major adjustments in memory hierarchy design.

Conclusion: This work transforms the traditional heuristic into an actionable, inclusive provisioning framework, redefining NAND flash as a primary data tier and providing a foundation for future research into AI memory hierarchy paradigms.

Abstract: In 1987, Jim Gray and Gianfranco Putzolu introduced the five-minute rule, a
simple, storage-memory-economics-based heuristic for deciding when data should
live in DRAM rather than on storage. Subsequent revisits to the rule largely
retained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and
workload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first
principles, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and
physics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these
elements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable
provisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially
GPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained
random access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a
few seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and
exposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further
introduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and
sensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research.
Finally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system
design space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift. Overall, we turn a
classical heuristic into an actionable, feasibility-aware analysis and
provisioning framework and set the stage for further research on AI-era memory
hierarchy.

Result: Hardware disaggregation has transformative potential for data centers, impacting application design, resource management, energy optimization, and more.

Conclusion: While significant progress has been made, there are still challenges and opportunities in fully realizing the potential of disaggregated architectures, which could redefine data center operations and infrastructure.

Abstract: Hardware disaggregation seeks to transform Data Center (DC) resources from
traditional server fleets into unified resource pools. Despite existing
challenges that may hinder its full realization, significant progress has been
made in both industry and academia. In this article, we provide an overview of
the motivations and recent advancements in hardware disaggregation. We further
discuss the research challenges and opportunities associated with disaggregated
architectures, focusing on aspects that have received limited attention. We
argue that hardware disaggregation has the potential to reshape the entire DC
ecosystem, impacting application design, resource scheduling, hardware
configuration, cooling, and power system optimization. Additionally, we present
a numerical study to illustrate several key aspects of these challenges.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper proposes AIM, a software and hardware co-design framework for IR-drop mitigation in high-performance SRAM Processing-in-Memory, achieving significant energy efficiency improvement and speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses IR-drop issues that arise from higher performance requirements in SRAM PIM circuits, which threaten chip reliability and conventional mitigation methods compromise PPA.

Method: The authors leverage PIM-specific properties (bit-serial processing) to correlate workloads with IR-drop via Rtog and HR, introduce software optimizations (LHR and WDS), implement IR-Booster for dynamic V-f pair adjustment, and propose HR-aware task mapping to integrate software and hardware.

Result: Post-layout simulations on a 7nm SRAM PIM chip demonstrate 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, 2.29x energy efficiency improvement, and 1.152x speedup.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a software-hardware co-design approach like AIM can effectively mitigate IR-drop, enhancing both chip reliability and overall performance.

Abstract: SRAM Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as the most promising
implementation for high-performance PIM, delivering superior computing density,
energy efficiency, and computational precision. However, the pursuit of higher
performance necessitates more complex circuit designs and increased operating
frequencies, which exacerbate IR-drop issues. Severe IR-drop can significantly
degrade chip performance and even threaten reliability. Conventional
circuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are
resource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To
address these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware
co-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.
Initially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties
of PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between
PIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,
enabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while
maintaining computational accuracy through software optimization. Subsequently,
we develop IR-Booster, a dynamic adjustment mechanism that integrates
software-level HR information with hardware-based IR-drop monitoring to adapt
the V-f pairs of the PIM macro, achieving enhanced energy efficiency and
performance. Finally, we propose the HR-aware task mapping method, bridging
software and hardware designs to achieve optimal improvement. Post-layout
simulation results on a 7nm 256-TOPS PIM chip demonstrate that AIM achieves up
to 69.2% IR-drop mitigation, resulting in 2.29x energy efficiency improvement
and 1.152x speedup.

TL;DR: Modern supercomputers and data centers are evolving to use heterogeneous architectures to address data movement inefficiencies and computational bottlenecks, but face communication challenges among components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand from data-intensive applications such as generative AI and simulations requires architectures that minimize data movement while enhancing computational efficiency.

Method: Explores the use of heterogeneous architectures combining CPUs, accelerators, and high-bandwidth memory/storage technologies.

Result: These architectures reduce data movement and improve efficiency but lead to communication bottlenecks as accelerators and networking become more complex.

Conclusion: Although integrating heterogeneous architectures shows promise, addressing communication bottlenecks within and between nodes remains a critical challenge.

Abstract: The rapid growth of data-intensive applications such as generative AI,
scientific simulations, and large-scale analytics is driving modern
supercomputers and data centers toward increasingly heterogeneous and tightly
integrated architectures. These systems combine powerful CPUs and accelerators
with emerging high-bandwidth memory and storage technologies to reduce data
movement and improve computational efficiency. However, as the number of
accelerators per node increases, communication bottlenecks emerge both within

*Pranav Bhandari,Nicolas Fay,Sanjeevan Selvaganapathy,Amitava Datta,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores steering Large Language Models (LLMs) based on personality traits using subspace discovery methods and dynamic injection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to reliably control and align the personality-like traits exhibited by LLMs during generation for practical applications.

Method: The proposed method extracts hidden state activations in LLMs related to Big Five Personality Traits, identifies trait-specific layers using low-rank subspace discovery, and implements dynamic layer selection for precise steering.

Result: LLMs' personality traits occupy low-rank shared subspaces that can be strategically manipulated to align the model's behavior.

Conclusion: This study bridges psychological theory with actionable mechanisms for LLM alignment without compromising fluency, variance, or general capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TextualVerifier, a self-verification framework for TextGrad, enabling more reliable reasoning in text-based optimization by leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning and majority voting with large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad lacks self-verification mechanisms for ensuring the validity of reasoning in text-based decision-making, creating a gap in reliable optimization without numerical equations.

Method: The proposed TextualVerifier employs a four-stage process: chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both loss-function evaluation and optimization result verification stages.

Result: Experimental results using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model show significant validity and performance improvements in various benchmarks. The validity of reasoning steps increased by 29%, and integration with TextGrad improved benchmark performances by up to 10.71 percentage points.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier establishes the first framework for self-verification in text-based optimization using large language models, enhancing reasoning reliability without needing numerical gradients and paving the way for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for high-quality language models for non-English languages, specifically Polish, due to the dominance of English-centric LLM development.

Method: PLLuM was developed using a 140-billion-token Polish corpus, custom datasets for instructions (77k) and preference optimization (100k), alongside a Responsible AI framework for data governance and safety filtering.

Result: The PLLuM model was successfully trained and demonstrated applicability in public administration tasks, showcasing its utility and alignment for real-world applications.

Conclusion: PLLuM seeks to advance open research and support sovereign AI technologies in Poland by publicly releasing tailored Polish language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI

*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces STARS, a computationally efficient inference-time method to align large language models (LLMs) with human values by using token-level rejection sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods like fine-tuning are computationally expensive, while inference-time approaches often require infeasible resources. Therefore, there is a need for a more efficient approach to align LLMs.

Method: The authors propose STARS, which steers model generation by iteratively sampling, scoring, and either accepting or rejecting short token segments during decoding. This allows for early corrections and improved alignment.

Result: STARS outperformed existing methods including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), showing up to a 14.9% improvement in win-rate compared to SFT, and up to a 4.3% improvement compared to DPO.

Conclusion: Granular, reward-guided sampling via STARS proves to be a robust, efficient, and general approach for aligning LLMs, offering a promising alternative to traditional fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

### [43] [Divide, Cache, Conquer: Dichotomic Prompting for Efficient Multi-Label LLM-Based Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03830)
*Mikołaj Langner,Jan Eliasz,Ewa Rudnicka,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable method for multi-label text classification using large language models, optimizing efficiency and accuracy by reformulating classification as dichotomic queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-label text classification can be inefficient for large language models, particularly for short-text inference, necessitating a scalable and accurate approach.

Method: The authors reformulate classification tasks as sequences of independent yes/no decisions paired with prefix caching. They utilize LLM-to-SLM distillation for annotating datasets and use the annotations to fine-tune smaller models.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieve notable improvements in predictive performance over zero-shot baselines, especially for training-dependent dimensions, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method.

Conclusion: This approach successfully combines decomposition, distillation, and caching mechanisms to create an efficient and scalable framework for text classification, adaptable across diverse domains beyond affective text analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the quality of low-resourced language datasets used in Machine Translation, focusing on gender representation and harmful biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address risks associated with prioritizing dataset quantity over quality in NLP research, which affects performance and perpetuates bias for low-resourced languages.

Method: The analysis focuses on three languages (Afan Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya), examining gender depiction in datasets, domain representation, and harmful content issues.

Result: Findings show skewed gender representation and toxic depictions, particularly bias against women, with larger datasets having more harmful content.

Conclusion: The paper calls for prioritizing quality in low-resourced language datasets and encourages early mitigation of societal biases and harmful content in NLP research.

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Dai Do,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents GRAD, a decoding method that reduces hallucination in large language models without retraining by leveraging corpus-derived evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent hallucination issues in LLMs by grounding generation in evidence without relying on fragile or costly external knowledge integration methods.

Method: Introduced a decoding-time method called GRAD, which uses a sparse token transition graph constructed from corpus evidence to influence generation. It adaptively merges graph-retrieved logits with model logits.

Result: GRAD outperformed baselines across various benchmarks by improving intrinsic accuracy, factual correctness, and reducing hallucination rates while maintaining fluency.

Conclusion: GRAD provides an efficient and effective alternative to existing approaches, leveraging corpus-level statistical evidence to produce more truthful and verifiable outputs.

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more
truthful and verifiable outputs.

*Alvin Wei Ming Tan,Ben Prystawski,Veronica Boyce,Michael C. Frank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of humans and vision-language models in iterated reference games under varying contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare human and machine learning vision-language models' capabilities in pragmatic reasoning for multi-turn linguistic tasks.

Method: Tests were conducted by altering the context in iterated reference games to assess how amount, order, and relevance affected reasoning performance.

Result: Models had low performance compared to humans without relevant context but showed significant improvement with relevant context.

Conclusion: Relevant context is crucial for enhancing model performance, but few-shot reference games remain challenging for current machine learning models.

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), a novel tool to assess societal well-being through geolocated tweets using language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding societal well-being beyond traditional economic measures through multidimensional constructs like human flourishing.

Method: Used fine-tuned large language models to analyze 2.6 billion U.S. geolocated tweets (2013-2023), classifying expressions across 48 indicators tied to Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework.

Result: Validated indicators at county and state levels over time, revealing correlations with existing measures and offering unprecedented resolution of socio-spatial well-being data.

Conclusion: The HFGI dataset provides a powerful resource for analyzing well-being, inequality, and social changes, reflecting human flourishing dynamics via social media over a decade.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned
large language models to classify expressions across 48 indicators aligned with
Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at
unprecedented resolution, offering insights into the dynamics of human
flourishing as reflected in social media discourse across the United States
over the past decade.

### [48] [Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models via Vector Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03945)
*Fu-Chun Yang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for latent communication in multi-agent systems, replacing plain token-based interactions with semantic vector translations to improve efficiency and collaboration between large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of token-based message transfer in multi-agent systems and enable direct semantic exchanges between large language models, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving collaboration.

Method: A dual-encoder translator is trained to create mappings between the latent representations of two language models (Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct), facilitating vector-based communication. Translated vectors are then injected into model generations at 30% blending strength.

Result: The translator achieves an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Incorporating translated vectors steers target model outputs without destabilizing logits. Results indicate a 2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, with general-purpose models producing more transferable representations.

Conclusion: Cross-model latent communication is feasible and enhances multi-agent AI systems by allowing semantic information sharing rather than token-based communication. The approach preserves computational stability and offers potential for more efficient collaboration among language models.

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework enhancing retrieval-augmented large language models (RAG) by integrating abductive inference to address gaps in reasoning when retrieved evidence is incomplete.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current limitations in RAG pipelines arise from incomplete evidence during retrieval, leading to gaps in reasoning processes. The paper seeks to address this by incorporating abductive inference to improve reasoning and robustness.

Method: The framework identifies insufficient evidence, generates plausible missing premises through abductive inference, and validates these premises with consistency and plausibility checks.

Result: Experimental testing on abductive reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrated improved answer accuracy and faithfulness in reasoning.

Conclusion: Abductive inference enhances the robustness and explainability of RAG systems, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool in improving the reasoning capabilities of such models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Weakly Supervised Transducer (WST) to reduce dependency on high-quality annotated data in automatic speech recognition, maintaining effective performance even with high transcription errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of RNN-T on high-quality annotated data is costly and challenging, requiring alternatives for robust ASR performance with erroneous transcripts.

Method: The authors introduce the WST by incorporating a flexible training graph to handle transcript errors without requiring confidence estimation or pre-trained models.

Result: WST showed resilience to transcription errors up to 70%, outperforming CTC-based approaches like BTC and OTC in synthetic and industrial datasets.

Conclusion: WST is a practical and robust approach for ASR tasks under conditions with high transcription errors, and its implementation will be made public.

Abstract: The Recurrent Neural Network-Transducer (RNN-T) is widely adopted in
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks but depends heavily
on large-scale, high-quality annotated data, which are often costly and
difficult to obtain. To mitigate this reliance, we propose a Weakly Supervised
Transducer (WST), which integrates a flexible training graph designed to
robustly handle errors in the transcripts without requiring additional
confidence estimation or auxiliary pre-trained models. Empirical evaluations on
synthetic and industrial datasets reveal that WST effectively maintains
performance even with transcription error rates of up to 70%, consistently
outperforming existing Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based weakly
supervised approaches, such as Bypass Temporal Classification (BTC) and
Omni-Temporal Classification (OTC). These results demonstrate the practical
utility and robustness of WST in realistic ASR settings. The implementation
will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces T-FIX, a benchmark for evaluating if LLM explanations align with expert-level reasoning across seven knowledge-intensive fields, addressing the gap in current evaluation schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing reliance on LLMs in expert-intensive domains like medicine and astronomy, there is a need for explanations that align with the reasoning of domain experts, which is overlooked by current evaluation methods.

Method: The authors propose T-FIX, a benchmark developed with input from domain experts across seven fields. They also introduce new metrics to evaluate the alignment of LLM explanations with expert judgment.

Result: T-FIX provides a systematic evaluation framework and novel metrics to determine whether LLM-generated explanations reflect expert-level reasoning.

Conclusion: Aligning LLM explanations with expert-level reasoning is critical, and T-FIX enables this evaluation, paving the way for better integration of LLMs in expert domains.

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

*Xinying Qian,Ying Zhang,Yu Zhao,Baohang Zhou,Xuhui Sui,Xiaojie Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework called Plan of Knowledge (PoK) to improve Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) by combining structured query planning with temporal knowledge retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to TKGQA failed to fully understand complex temporal semantics, and Large Language Models (LLMs), while having strong reasoning capabilities, struggle with temporal reasoning, hallucination, and knowledge limitations.

Method: The paper proposes PoK, which includes: a 'Plan of Knowledge' module to decompose temporal questions into sub-tasks for reasoning guidance; and a 'Temporal Knowledge Store' (TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework for retrieving temporally aligned facts from Temporal Knowledge Graphs.

Result: PoK outperforms state-of-the-art TKGQA methods, improving retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs by up to 56.0% on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed PoK framework effectively enhances the interpretability, retrieval precision, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in addressing temporal knowledge-based questions.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

*Špela Vintar,Jan Jona Javoršek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines how large language models (LLMs) compare to humans in generating associations to emotionally charged words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs mimic or differ from human associative behavior, especially regarding emotionally loaded word stimuli.

Method: A comparative analysis was conducted between humans and LLMs, exploring responses to emotionally charged words.

Result: Human-LLM association overlap was moderate, with LLMs amplifying emotional load and producing more predictable but less creative associations.

Conclusion: While LLMs show some similarity to human associations, their emotional amplification and reduced creativity highlight distinct differences.

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

TL;DR: The study trains and evaluates transformer-based models to improve automated detection of protected health information (PHI) in radiology reports, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous models and commercial systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated de-identification of radiology reports is crucial to securely process clinical text while safeguarding sensitive patient information.

Method: A transformer-based PHI de-identification pipeline was fine-tuned using large radiology datasets, expanded with an additional PHI category (AGE), and benchmarked against commercial systems using precision, recall, and F1 scores.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy (F1: 0.973 on Penn and 0.996 on Stanford datasets), outperformed vendor systems, and demonstrated robust synthetic PHI evaluation.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models trained on diverse datasets can enhance PHI detection and set new standards for secure clinical text processing, improving privacy without compromising data utility.

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper revisits language identification in the limit, enhancing the classical problem with $k$-list guesses and provides theoretical characterizations for when $k$-list identification is possible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and enhance the classical language identification problem by introducing $k$-list guesses, motivated by recent progress in language generation.

Method: The study provides a recursive characterization of identifiable language collections and investigates identification rates in a statistical setting with $k$-list guessing.

Result: The paper establishes that $k$-list identifiable collections can be identified at exponential rates and characterizes when identification tasks fail entirely.

Conclusion: Language collections identifiable with $k$-list guesses can be decomposed into sub-collections identified at size $1$, achieving optimal exponential rates if identifiable under $k$-list guessing.

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

TL;DR: Batch prompting improves accuracy and efficiency in large language models by regularizing model behavior during reasoning and reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underappreciated benefit of batching in improving multi-step reasoning accuracy and efficiency in large reasoning models (LRMs).

Method: Conducting a comprehensive study on 13 benchmarks to analyze the effects of batching on LRM performance during multi-step reasoning.

Result: Batching substantially improves reasoning accuracy, reduces token usage (up to 3x-5x), and suppresses overthinking and hedging behavior. Emergent collective effects enable models to generalize better within a batch.

Conclusion: Batch prompting serves as both a throughput optimization and a regularizer, enhancing inference efficiency and reliability for large language models.

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

*Xinyuan Li,Murong Xu,Wenbiao Tao,Hanlun Zhu,Yike Zhao,Jipeng Zhang,Yunshi Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces RIDE, a framework to rigorously evaluate the mathematical reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by generating adversarial question variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust evaluation of LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities by addressing biases caused by training data leakage and pattern recognition, and to develop a systematic benchmark for question difficulty.

Method: The paper proposes RIDE, an adversarial question-rewriting framework that integrates Item Response Theory (IRT) for difficulty measurement, utilizes 35 LLMs for building a difficulty ranker via reinforcement learning, and generates well-posed, challenging mathematical problems.

Result: Applying RIDE to mathematical benchmarks resulted in more difficult problem variations that caused a 21.73% average performance drop in 26 tested LLMs, revealing their vulnerability in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: RIDE highlights the limited robustness of LLMs in mathematical reasoning, improves the evaluation quality of such models, and offers a standardized method for benchmarking question difficulty.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

### [58] [CantoASR: Prosody-Aware ASR-LALM Collaboration for Low-Resource Cantonese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04139)
*Dazhong Chen,Yi-Cheng Lin,Yuchen Huang,Ziwei Gong,Di Jiang,Zeying Xie,Yi R.,Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new framework called CantoASR enhances Cantonese ASR performance using advanced models and acoustic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for Cantonese, which include limited data, complex tonal features, and accent variability.

Method: The authors propose a framework named CantoASR, combining forced alignment for acoustic features, LoRA-tuned Whisper for tone discrimination, and instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction.

Result: CantoASR demonstrated significant improvements in character error rates (CER) compared to Whisper-Large-V3 on spontaneous Cantonese data.

Conclusion: Integrating acoustic features with large audio-language model reasoning offers a scalable solution for low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores multi-agent pipelines for improving SQL generation by leveraging small and large language models (LLMs). It shows enhancements in execution accuracy using collaborative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large models struggle with SQL generation due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Smaller, efficient models are often overlooked in this domain.

Method: The authors proposed three multi-agent LLM pipelines: Multi-agent discussion (collaborative refinement), Planner-Coder (stepwise generation), and Coder-Aggregator (independent generation with reasoning-based selection).

Result: The multi-agent discussion pipeline demonstrated up to a 10.6% improvement in execution accuracy. The Reasoner-Coder pipeline achieved the highest accuracy score of 56.4% in specific benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-agent strategies can significantly optimize SQL generation and boost execution accuracy, making smaller LLMs more capable for such tasks. The methods are available for further use and validation.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

*Mohammed Musthafa Rafi,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Aditya Balu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques the misuse of LLMs for inflated content writing and presents LAAC (LLM as a Communicator) as a paradigm shift, focusing on authentic, structured intent communication. It evaluates trustworthiness concerns through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in AI-generated communication where senders use LLMs for verbose content and recipients condense them into summaries, losing authenticity and genuine human interaction.

Method: The paper proposes using LAAC (LLM as a Communicator) as a structured communication intermediary. It further evaluates trustworthiness through controlled experiments focused on three dimensions: Information Capture Fidelity, Reproducibility, and Query Response Integrity.

Result: Preliminary findings from experiments show measurable trust gaps in LAAC's performance, particularly in information fidelity, consistency, and reliability across use cases.

Conclusion: While LAAC holds promise for improving authentic communication and addressing AI-related inefficiencies, its deployment faces critical trust challenges, including fidelity, reproducibility, and integrity, which need resolution for reliable application in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

### [61] [Computational Turing Test Reveals Systematic Differences Between Human and AI Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195)
*Nicolò Pagan,Petter Törnberg,Christopher A. Bail,Anikó Hannák,Christopher Barrie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computational approach to validating the realism of text generated by large language models (LLMs), benchmarking their ability to simulate human-like communication across different platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are increasingly applied to simulate human behavior in social sciences, the assumption that they generate realistic human-like text remains underexplored and unvalidated with robust tools.

Method: The authors propose a computational Turing test combining aggregate metrics (e.g., detectability and semantic similarity) and interpretable linguistic features to assess realism. They tested nine LLMs with different calibration strategies on datasets from platforms such as X, Bluesky, and Reddit.

Result: Findings reveal LLM outputs are distinguishable from human texts, especially in affective tone and emotional expression, despite calibration efforts. Larger model sizes and instruction-tuning fail to improve human-likeness, highlighting a trade-off between human-likeness and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable validation framework and reveals significant limitations in current LLMs capturing human communication, offering insights into their ability to replicate realistic human behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

*Michał Karp,Anna Kubaszewska,Magdalena Król,Robert Król,Aleksander Smywiński-Pohl,Mateusz Szymański,Witold Wydmański*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) to pass the Polish National Appeal Chamber qualifying exam. While they performed well in the knowledge test, they failed the practical portion and made critical mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether current LLMs can effectively handle complex, high-stakes legal evaluations, such as those required for membership in Poland's National Appeal Chamber, and evaluate their functionalities as potential tools for legal settings.

Method: The authors tested LLMs such as GPT-4.1 and others on the exam's components: a multiple-choice legal knowledge test and a written judgment. A hybrid information retrieval pipeline was built, and a 'LLM-as-a-judge' approach was evaluated using automated model-generated answers reviewed by other models.

Result: The LLMs had satisfactory performance in the knowledge test but failed to meet the passing threshold for the written judgment segment. The 'LLM-as-a-judge' evaluations lacked alignment with official examiners' decisions, exposing issues like hallucination, poor citation, and weak logic.

Conclusion: Despite technological advancements, current LLMs are not yet competent to replace human judges or independent examiners in scenarios requiring nuanced legal understanding, such as Polish public procurement adjudication.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

### [63] [REMIND: Input Loss Landscapes Reveal Residual Memorization in Post-Unlearning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04228)
*Liran Cohen,Yaniv Nemcovesky,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces REMIND, a novel evaluation method for verifying effective data unlearning in machine learning models, addressing potential residual influences that compromise privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of verifying if a model has effectively forgotten specific training data, ensuring privacy and trust without retraining.

Method: REMIND evaluates loss dynamics over small input variations to detect subtle residual effects in unlearned data and compares these against non-unlearned data characteristics.

Result: REMIND identified flatter loss landscapes for unlearned data and sharper dynamics for retained/unrelated data; it outperformed existing evaluation methods under similar constraints.

Conclusion: REMIND provides a sensitive, robust, and interpretable framework for assessing machine unlearning effectiveness in practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

### [64] [Reusing Pre-Training Data at Test Time is a Compute Multiplier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04234)
*Alex Fang,Thomas Voice,Ruoming Pang,Ludwig Schmidt,Tom Gunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers explored how efficient large language model pre-training is by combining retrieval augmented generation with additional test-time compute, showing significant accuracy improvement, especially for well-known benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how much pre-training leaves information unutilized in large datasets and quantify the efficiency of the pre-training process.

Method: Use retrieval augmented generation combined with test-time compute to retrieve contextual data and measure its impact on benchmark performance across tasks.

Result: Substantial accuracy improvement observed in benchmarks like MMLU, Math-500, and SimpleQA, including ~5x compute efficiency boost and a 10% accuracy gain for LLaMA 3.1 8B on MMLU.

Conclusion: Current pre-training methods underutilize the information in datasets, indicating room for optimization and improvements in the learning processes.

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

*Salma Mekaoui,Hiba Sofyan,Imane Amaaz,Imane Benchrif,Arsalane Zarghili,Ilham Chaker,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based approach to enhance topic labeling in topic modeling, addressing the issue of interpretability of topic words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growth in unstructured textual data, there is a need for interpreting topic models as computational approaches often require high resources.

Method: A graph-based method enriches topic words by incorporating semantically related terms and their relationships, aiming to assign labels without heavy computation.

Result: The proposed method performed better than traditional benchmarks in BERTScore and cosine similarity and achieved comparable results to ChatGPT-3.5, maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Graph-based topic labeling improves interpretability of topic models and is computationally efficient, with potential avenues for automation and further enhancement.

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSPO, a novel algorithm for improving LLMs’ reasoning capabilities, outperforming GRPO and GSPO in stability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR algorithms (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) face issues like instability in policy updates and inefficient utilization of sampled data.

Method: SSPO employs a sentence-level importance ratio, balancing GRPO and GSPO. It incorporates sentence entropy in PPO-CLIP to adjust clipping bounds and optimize token exploration.

Result: SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, outperforming GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), with state-of-the-art performance in three datasets.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively leverages generated data, balancing optimization stability and data utilization, offering advances in LLM reasoning skills.

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of data quality in machine translation, proposing a learnability-driven fine-tuning methodology that significantly boosts efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve machine translation models through effective data selection to ensure robust and reliable translation systems.

Method: A learnability score evaluates data points for training, coupled with a batch selection strategy to optimize interdependencies and maximize data relevance during fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on mBART with the CCMatrix dataset showed up to fivefold data efficiency improvement and enhanced computational efficiency by 24 times, along with better generalization and translation performance.

Conclusion: Strategic data selection using learnability score and optimized batch strategies can elevate computational efficiency and translation outcomes in machine translation systems.

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

TL;DR: This paper examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) for temporal reasoning using trivia from a 1940 Norwegian book, analyzing responses in both English and Norwegian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs in understanding and reasoning about temporal contexts, specifically answering trivia from 1940 while considering language variations.

Method: Researchers tested multiple LLM families in English and Norwegian contexts, graded answers using LLM-as-judge and native speaker verification, and analyzed language and model size impacts on accuracy.

Result: English prompts provided better results than Norwegian, which was unexpected, and larger LLMs performed more accurately. Specific models tested include DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate a capability for temporal reasoning, with notable differences in language performance and improvement tied to model size, highlighting areas for further investigation.

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic modeling framework called PTTSD for accurately predicting depression severity (PHQ-8 scores) from clinical interviews, achieving state-of-the-art performance and well-calibrated predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the lack of uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling in existing predictive models for depression severity, which are important for clinical decision-making.

Method: The study proposes the PTTSD framework, employing bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, residual connections, and probabilistic output heads (Gaussian or Student-t) trained via negative log-likelihood. It also uses sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one modeling for predicting PHQ-8 scores.

Result: PTTSD performed with state-of-the-art accuracy on E-DAIC and DAIC-WOZ datasets (e.g., MAE = 3.85 and 3.55, respectively), with results demonstrating its interpretability, utility of attention mechanisms, and generality compared to MentalBERT.

Conclusion: PTTSD combines accuracy with interpretability in predicting depression severity, supports clinical decision-making with uncertainty-aware forecasting, and contributes to advancing probabilistic temporal modeling for mental health applications.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

TL;DR: ThaiOCRBench is the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) for Thai text-focused tasks, revealing a significant performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the lack of benchmarks for vision-language models tailored to low-resource, script-complex languages like Thai, especially for text-rich visual understanding.

Method: The authors developed ThaiOCRBench, a diverse dataset with 2,808 annotated samples across 13 task categories, to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings and identify gaps in performance.

Result: Proprietary VLMs, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, significantly outperformed open-source models, with specific challenges identified in fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction.

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench fills a critical gap by providing a standardized evaluation framework for Thai-language document understanding, offering valuable insights for improving VLMs in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

Motivation: To address the limitations in existing tabular reasoning benchmarks that predominantly focus on small, uniform tables and fail to encapsulate the complexity of real-world data.

Method: Introduces RUST-BENCH, a benchmark comprising 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables across two domains (science and sports), designed to assess reasoning ability across data scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and complexity.

Result: Experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous table schemas and multi-hop reasoning, highlighting shortcomings in current model architectures.

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH serves as a new and challenging benchmark that identifies weaknesses and drives advancements in tabular reasoning research for LLMs.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.
RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular
reasoning research.

### [72] [OUNLP at TSAR 2025 Shared Task: Multi-Round Text Simplifier via Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04495)
*Cuong Huynh,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes multi-round text simplification methods (MRS-Rule & MRS-Joint) leveraging GPT-4o, achieving 7th place at TSAR-2025 and demonstrating performance gains with improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop effective readability-controlled text simplification methods and explore the relationship between CEFR level gaps and simplification efficacy.

Method: The authors introduced multi-round simplification methods combining LLM-prompting (GPT-4o) with rule-based steps: MRS-Rule, a purely rule-based approach, and MRS-Joint, a combination of rule-based and LLM-driven simplification.

Result: The proposed systems were ranked 7th among 20 teams in the TSAR-2025 Shared Task, and later refinements in MRS-Joint further improved performance.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of CEFR gaps in simplification success, and demonstrates that multi-round approaches starting with LLM candidates enhance text simplification outcomes.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and compares personality-like behaviors of six Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Big Five personality framework, highlighting differences influenced by sampling temperature and architectural variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding personality-like behaviors in LLMs is vital for their responsible development and ethical deployment.

Method: The study systematically applied the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, examined how sampling temperatures impacted personality dimensions, and used hierarchical clustering for evaluating model profiles.

Result: Significant variations in four of the five personality dimensions were identified, including Neuroticism and Extraversion, with clustering showing distinct model groups influenced by architecture.

Conclusion: Findings enhance knowledge of personality patterns in LLMs, inform tuning and selection processes, and better address ethical AI governance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly
important for responsible development and deployment. This paper systematically
evaluates six LLMs, applying the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework, to
assess trait expressions under varying sampling temperatures. We find
significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that
architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait
profiles. Taken together, these results offer new insights into the emergence
of personality-like patterns in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model
tuning, selection, and the ethical governance of AI systems. We share the data

*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge introduces a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for edge applications that minimizes computational and memory demands while maintaining high accuracy close to full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current full fine-tuning of CNNs for edge applications faces challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and energy budgets, creating the need for a parameter-efficient methodology.

Method: LoRA-Edge uses Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) on pretrained convolutional layers and selectively trains a specific component (output-side core) while maintaining inactive auxiliary paths initially. It later integrates the updates back into dense kernels without affecting inference costs.

Result: The method reduces trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning while maintaining accuracy within 4.7%. It also demonstrates faster convergence on edge devices like Jetson Orin Nano.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge offers a practical and efficient solution for on-device CNN fine-tuning, maintaining high performance while adhering to strict resource constraints in edge platforms.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI is an open-source software that allows researchers to annotate animal behaviors and interactions directly in video data, assisting in computer vision model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of tools for detecting and annotating interactions in video data.

Method: Developed SILVI, software combining behavior annotation with localization in videos.

Result: SILVI integrates capabilities for behavior and interaction annotation, facilitating fine-grained analyses.

Conclusion: SILVI bridges gaps in video annotation tools, contributing to behavioral ecology and computer vision, with potential applications for human interaction analysis.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [76] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows how fundamental noise injection techniques can enhance the robustness of deep learning models for COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays, by reducing performance gaps between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of deep learning models' failure to generalize to out-of-distribution data, especially in COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays, which often rely on shortcuts or artifacts instead of actual biomarkers.

Method: The study implements noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt-and-Pepper) during training of the models to improve their robustness across distribution shifts.

Result: The noise injection techniques significantly reduced the performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluations from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across metrics like AUC, F1, accuracy, recall, and specificity using data from ten random seeds.

Conclusion: Incorporating noise injection techniques improves the generalizability of deep learning models for COVID-19 detection, suggesting that such strategies can mitigate vulnerability to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of imitation learning policies for X-ray-guided spine procedures, particularly targeting bi-plane-guided cannula insertion, using simulated environments and visual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for accurate and lightweight robotic navigation in X-ray-guided, CT-free spinal procedures, addressing complex multi-view X-ray interpretation challenges.

Method: The method involves developing a simulation environment with realistic X-ray-guided spine procedures, generating trajectory datasets, and training imitation learning policies for cannula alignment based solely on visual information.

Result: The trained policy achieved a 68.5% first-attempt success rate, demonstrated robustness across diverse anatomies and initializations, and generalized well to real bi-planar X-rays despite simulation-based training.

Conclusion: Preliminary results show promise for imitation learning in this domain, but entry-point precision and feedback frequency need improvement for closed-loop control, pointing toward future developments.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [78] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores human ability to recognize social interactions using 3D visuospatial pose information, demonstrating its superiority over most AI vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at understanding social interactions from visual inputs, but existing AI vision systems struggle in this domain. Understanding the computational basis for human social judgments is necessary for advancing AI capabilities.

Method: The study used state-of-the-art algorithms to extract 3D joint positions from video clips and compared their performance in predicting human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed most AI vision models in predicting social interactions, and compact 3D social pose features reliably matched human judgments, even improving AI models' performance when used in combination.

Conclusion: Human social scene understanding heavily depends on explicit 3D pose representations, suggesting that incorporating simple visuospatial features into AI vision models can enhance their ability to make social interaction judgments.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight YOLOv12-based object detection system tailored for aerial drones to address efficient waste detection in deserts, presenting accuracy and efficiency improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the inefficiency and hazards of current waste collection methods in remote environments like deserts, leveraging AI technologies to improve precision and coverage.

Method: The method involves developing a pruned, lightweight YOLOv12 framework, combining Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and data augmentation strategies, and validating it using the DroneTrashNet dataset.

Result: Results show improved precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) with low latency and a compact model size, suitable for real-time drone deployment in remote environments.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the feasibility and superiority of combining data-centric and model-centric improvements for automated waste detection in challenging terrains.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [80] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition for deep learning models to handle small, imbalanced datasets and poor input quality by creating Composite Input Images (CoImg), resulting in higher predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality, which often lead to high false prediction rates in deep learning models.

Method: The authors introduced Class-Based Image Composition, a technique where multiple images of the same class are fused to create Composite Input Images (CoImg). This boosts intra-class variance, increases information density, and makes subtle disease patterns more distinguishable. They evaluated the method on the OCTDL dataset using a class-balanced dataset variation (Co-OCTDL) and performed comparative experiments.

Result: The proposed method significantly improved the performance of the VGG16 model on OCTDL, achieving 99.6% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.995, and an AUC of 0.9996. It also reduced the false prediction rate.

Conclusion: Class-Based Image Composition is a highly effective method for improving model performance on weak datasets by addressing class imbalance and enhancing information density. It demonstrates significant potential in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an unsupervised method for detecting unknown anomalies in medical imaging without relying on labeled data or expert oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of identifying anomalies in medical imaging data where labeled anomalies are scarce, and expert supervision is expensive and resource-intensive.

Method: The proposed framework begins with a small verified set of normal images and expands it incrementally. It leverages a frozen pretrained vision backbone with convolutional adapters for domain adaptation, uses k-NN scoring for anomaly detection, and implements probabilistic gates to ensure safety during incremental updates, avoiding false inclusions.

Result: The method achieves significant performance improvements across various datasets: COVID-CXR (ROC-AUC: 0.9489 to 0.9982, F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746), Pneumonia CXR (ROC-AUC: 0.6834 to 0.8968), and Brain MRI ND-5 (ROC-AUC: 0.6041 to 0.7269, PR-AUC: 0.7539 to 0.8211).

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates significant potential in refining anomaly detection effectively and efficiently for medical imaging domains with minimal labeled data or reliance on external supervision.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces methods for precise boundary detection in temporal action localization, improving accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of uniform computation in temporal action localization, which ignores boundary difficulty variations.

Method: Through Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) for sharper boundaries and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) for computationally efficient processing.

Result: BDR improves boundary peak sharpness and yields consistent mAP improvements; ATR enhances mAP while reducing computational costs, validated across benchmarks.

Conclusion: The complementary methods achieve optimal localization and resource-efficient processing, significantly advancing action localization research.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel unified framework for optimizing geometry and appearance in 3D reconstruction from multi-view images, enabling better editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction techniques for real-world objects with an emphasis on seamless integration of geometry and appearance optimization.

Method: Proposes a simultaneous optimization of mesh geometry and vertex colors using Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, leveraging image consistency, depth maps, and normals.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D reconstructions suitable for downstream editing tasks such as relighting and shape deformation.

Conclusion: The unified framework substantially improves 3D reconstruction quality and usability, bridging functionality for geometric and appearance editing purposes.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for accurate light field camera calibration using a linear fractional transformation parameter for decoupling lens components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Light field cameras require precise calibration for effective 3D reconstruction, but achieving this is technically challenging.

Method: The paper introduces a linear fractional transformation parameter (α), proposes an analytical least-squares solution, applies nonlinear refinement, and uses a feature-detection method on raw images.

Result: The experimental results verify the proposed method's effectiveness, and it enhances raw light field image simulation, essential for deep learning applications.

Conclusion: This approach improves light field camera calibration and image simulation efficiency, with source code available publicly.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw

### [85] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic dataset for scene reconstruction, focusing on predicting structural elements like walls and ceilings, which are less complex and more repetitive compared to objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene reconstruction methods face issues with incomplete reconstructions, particularly missing occluded surfaces. Structural elements like walls and ceilings are simpler and repetitive, making them easier to predict.

Method: A synthetic dataset named Room Envelopes is proposed. It includes RGB images paired with two pointmaps: one for visible surfaces and another for structural layouts, excluding fittings and fixtures. This dataset enables supervised feed-forward monocular geometry estimation.

Result: The dataset supports the development of estimators that predict both the visible surfaces and structural layout of scenes.

Conclusion: This approach enhances understanding of scene geometry by focusing on structural layout prediction, complementing existing scene reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

*Yuwen Tao,Kanglei Zhou,Xin Tan,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work introduces Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF), a differentiable framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation that resolves cross-view inconsistencies using novel methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation struggle with cross-view consistency due to reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view-specific feature learning.

Method: The proposed method, CaRF, integrates Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) to incorporate camera geometry and In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) to optimize inter-view discrepancies and prevent single view overfitting.

Result: CaRF achieves average mIoU improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CaRF promotes reliable and view-consistent 3D scene understanding, offering advancements in embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PhysCorr, a model-agnostic framework to improve physical consistency in text-to-video generation, addressing issues like implausible dynamics and unrealistic motion patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models often fail to maintain physical plausibility, with issues such as unrealistic motion and object interactions, limiting their use in fields like robotics and embodied AI.

Method: PhysCorr introduces PhysicsRM, a reward model evaluating physical consistency through intra-object stability and inter-object interactions. It also employs PhyDPO, a preference optimization pipeline guiding generation towards physically coherent outcomes.

Result: PhysCorr improves the physical realism of generated videos while maintaining visual fidelity and semantic alignment, as confirmed by extensive experiments across different benchmarks.

Conclusion: PhysCorr represents a significant step toward producing videos that are not only visually appealing but also physically realistic, enhancing their application potential in various domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently adapting pretrained Vision Transformers for robust performance on unseen domains without impairing generalization.

Method: GNN-MoE leverages Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning combined with a Mixture-of-Experts framework, employing a Graph Neural Network router instead of token-based routing to assign patches dynamically.

Result: GNN-MoE achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on DG benchmarks with high parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing, as implemented in GNN-MoE, significantly enhances the efficiency and precision of domain generalization in Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

Method: MedDChest is pre-trained from scratch on over 1.2 million thoracic imaging data using a novel Guided Random Resized Crops strategy, a content-aware augmentation approach. Further validation is performed by fine-tuning on downstream diagnostic tasks.

Result: MedDChest achieves superior results in thoracic diagnostic tasks compared to strong ImageNet-pretrained models, highlighting the benefits of in-domain pre-training and tailored augmentation strategies.

Conclusion: MedDChest establishes the effectiveness of domain-specific pre-training and data augmentation in medical imaging, serving as a robust feature extractor for thoracic imaging tasks. Model weights will be made publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation for highly accurate, scalable 3D mesh reconstruction and generation, outperforming existing methods in fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to improve 3D mesh representation by overcoming fidelity limitations and geometric compromises in existing iso-surface-based methods.

Method: Faithful Contouring is proposed as a sparse voxelized representation that supports over 2048+ resolutions and avoids conventional iso-surface remeshing processes. It incorporates a dual-mode autoencoder for enhanced reconstruction capabilities.

Result: The proposed method achieves nearly lossless geometric fidelity, surpassing baseline algorithms in representation and reconstruction accuracy. It reduces Chamfer Distance by 93% and improves F-score by 35% with minimal distance errors.

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring offers a highly efficient and accurate solution for 3D mesh representation and reconstruction, enabling better fidelity and versatility in 3D learning tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a biometric authentication system using PPG signals extracted from low-frame-rate fingertip videos with an accuracy of 98%, leveraging preprocessing techniques and a hybrid deep learning model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of motion artifacts, illumination changes, and physiological variability in PPG signals for robust biometric authentication in wearable and mobile devices.

Method: PPG signals were preprocessed with PCA, filtering, resampling, and normalization before converting to time-frequency scalograms via CWT. A hybrid model combining CVT, ConvMixer, and LSTM was used for classification.

Result: An authentication accuracy of 98% was achieved on a dataset of 46 subjects, demonstrating the model's robustness to noise and variability.

Conclusion: The proposed system is efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-world biometric security applications, with inherent liveness detection and robustness to variability and noise.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

*Zehui Feng,Chenqi Zhang,Mingru Wang,Minuo Wei,Shiwei Cheng,Cuntai Guan,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bratrix, an innovative framework for aligning brain data with multimodal language-anchored visual representations, improving tasks like retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving robust visual semantics from brain signals remains challenging due to subject variability and entangled visual features, and current approaches lack interpretability.

Method: The paper proposes Bratrix, which aligns visual stimuli and brain data in a shared latent space incorporating linguistic semantic anchoring, certainty weighting, and a two-stage training process.

Result: Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks show Bratrix outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning tasks.

Conclusion: Bratrix effectively enhances the alignment of brain data with multimodal semantic representations, advancing performance in neuroscience-related visual processing tasks.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares CycleGAN and Noise2Score (N2S) for CT image denoising in unpaired and self-supervised settings. CycleGAN achieves stronger image quality overall, while Noise2Score excels at handling very noisy inputs without clean pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance denoising methods for CT images in scenarios where clean paired data is inaccessible, focusing on unpaired and self-supervised approaches using effective paradigms.

Method: The study evaluates CycleGAN with a specific configuration (U-Net backbone and hyperparameters) and compares it to Noise2Score, a score-matching denoiser, under a common evaluation protocol.

Result: CycleGAN improves PSNR/SSIM from 34.66 dB / 0.9234 to 38.913 dB / 0.971 and achieves high unseen-set scores. Noise2Score provides competitive performance, especially for very noisy inputs without clean pairs.

Conclusion: CycleGAN is the most effective method for final image quality, while Noise2Score offers a valuable alternative for denoising when paired clean data is unavailable.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces UKAST, a U-Net inspired architecture integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within Swin Transformers, addressing inefficiencies and achieving superior accuracy in medical image segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to complex anatomy and limited annotated data. CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies while Transformers demand large datasets and computational resources.

Method: UKAST combines rational-function-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Swin Transformer encoders, optimizing data efficiency and computational performance compared to existing architectures.

Result: UKAST outperforms CNN and Transformer-based methods in various segmentation benchmarks, especially in data-scarce environments, owing to reduced computational demand and efficient utilization of Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformations.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness of KAN-enhanced Transformers in achieving data-efficient and accurate medical image segmentation, addressing limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of precisely controlling object localization in text-to-image synthesis, as existing methods inadequately utilize positional information.

Method: SpatialLock framework introduces Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) to jointly control and refine object spatial arrangements.

Result: The proposed method achieves IOU scores above 0.9 across multiple datasets, setting a new state-of-the-art for object positioning in T2I synthesis.

Conclusion: SpatialLock effectively enhances the precision and quality of object spatial localization in generated images, offering significant advancements in T2I applications.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

### [96] [Tortoise and Hare Guidance: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Multirate Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04117)
*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free strategy, Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), for accelerating diffusion sampling while preserving high-fidelity image generation. This approach reduces redundant computations, decreases function evaluations, and requires no model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address inefficiencies in diffusion model sampling, particularly focusing on computational redundancy and the need for acceleration without compromising image generation quality.

Method: THG leverages a multirate system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to separately process noise estimates and guidance terms based on their sensitivity to numerical errors. The method includes an error-bound-aware timestep sampler and guidance-scale scheduler for efficient processing.

Result: THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up to 30%, with minimal impact on image fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward $\leq$ 0.032), outperforming prior non-training-based acceleration methods under the same computation budgets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the efficacy of multirate formulations in diffusion solvers and establishes THG as an effective approach for real-time, high-quality image synthesis without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel framework for sketch generation using diffusion models, introducing mechanisms for more precise control over sketch styles using textual prompts and reference sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in sketch generation typically focus on general synthesis but lack explicit style control mechanisms.

Method: The framework utilizes textual prompts and reference sketches for explicit style guidance, employing linear smoothing and a style-content guidance mechanism to reduce content leakage and improve synthesis quality.

Result: The proposed method improves sketch generation accuracy, style alignment, and flexibility, particularly when structural similarity between reference and target sketches is low. It also supports multi-style generation.

Conclusion: This training-free framework addresses gaps in existing sketch generation methods, offering enhanced style control and synthesis quality, and is publicly available for use.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DMSORT, a novel method for robust maritime multi-object tracking (MOT) using a dual-branch structure for dynamic camera motion compensation and improved object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective maritime surveillance is challenging due to camera motion and visual degradation in complex maritime environments.

Method: The DMSORT framework combines an affine-compensation-based tracker with two branches: one for object detection and re-identification (ReID), and another for dynamic camera motion estimation. Key components include the Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN), the lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE), and a clustering-optimized feature fusion module.

Result: DMSORT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Singapore Maritime Dataset, excelling in runtime and identity consistency under adverse environments like jitter and occlusion.

Conclusion: DMSORT provides an efficient and robust solution for maritime MOT, achieving faster runtime and higher robustness than existing ReID-based MOT frameworks.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

### [101] [Learning from Online Videos at Inference Time for Computer-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04137)
*Yujian Liu,Ze Wang,Hao Chen,Ximeng Sun,Xiaodong Yu,Jialian Wu,Jiang Liu,Emad Barsoum,Zicheng Liu,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for computer-use agents to learn and improve performance by effectively using online video tutorials as structured guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of computer-use agents that struggle with domain-specific and multi-step procedural tasks compared to humans, who can learn effectively from online video tutorials.

Method: The authors propose a framework that retrieves tutorial videos, converts them into structured trajectories, and dynamically selects relevant segments at inference time through a two-stage selection mechanism. A VLM (Vision-Language Model) is used to identify UI actions, segment videos, and label objectives for guidance.

Result: The framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements over strong baseline agents in experiments conducted on two widely-used benchmarks. It is more effective than other variants relying only on textual data.

Conclusion: The study shows that systematic distillation of online video tutorials into actionable and segmented guidance significantly enhances the capabilities of computer-use agents. The findings emphasize the importance of trajectory selection, action filtering, and integrating visual information.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

### [102] [Seeing Straight: Document Orientation Detection for Efficient OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04161)
*Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Raja Kolla,Ali Faraz,Shaharukh Khan,Akash,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the pre-processing challenge of document orientation correction, crucial for OCR tasks, by introducing a benchmark (OCR-Rotation-Bench) and proposing a high-accuracy rotation classification pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Correcting document orientation is critical in enhancing OCR performance, especially when user errors during capture result in misalignment.

Method: The authors introduce a benchmark (ORB) comprising rotation-transformed datasets in English and Indic languages, and develop a fine-tuned vision encoder-based lightweight rotation classification pipeline.

Result: The proposed method achieves 96% accuracy on English datasets and 92% on Indic datasets for rotation classification, significantly boosting OCR performance.

Conclusion: The study successfully establishes a robust approach for rotation correction, aiding OCR systems and highlighting improvements across multiple datasets and models.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates the impact of various color transformation techniques on image registration in digital pathology, identifying CycleGAN as the most effective method for improving registration accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate image registration across modalities is crucial in digital pathology for applications like biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction, but challenges remain in aligning multimodal images effectively.

Method: The researchers applied different color transformation techniques (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane) and image preprocessing steps, registering multimodal images using the VALIS method, and evaluating their performance using rTRE and custom key point evaluation.

Result: CycleGAN color transformation consistently achieved the lowest registration errors compared to other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning multimodal images.

Conclusion: Applying color transformation, especially CycleGAN, before registration enhances image alignment across modalities, thereby supporting better analysis in digital pathology.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

*Josef Mayr,Anna Reithmeir,Maxime Di Folco,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies the use of covariance descriptors for medical image classification, focusing on SPDNet and pre-trained vision encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate covariance descriptors, which are effective in general vision tasks, for their potential in improving medical image classification.

Method: Covariance descriptors are constructed from features of pre-trained general vision encoders (GVEs) like DINOv2 and MedSAM, and are compared against handcrafted descriptors across medical imaging datasets.

Result: GVE-based covariance descriptors outperform handcrafted ones, and SPDNet combined with DINOv2 features achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained GVEs shows great promise for advancing medical image analysis.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an innovative approach to human motion style transfer by incorporating higher-order statistics, enhancing spatiotemporal coherence and dynamic style representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve human motion style transfer by addressing the limitations of traditional techniques that only use mean and variance, which fail to capture complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence of motion.

Method: The proposed approach introduces Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF), which integrates Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn), along with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that AStF achieves superior performance in motion style transfer, delivering more realistic and coherent motion styles compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis) in improving the quality of human motion style transfer and establishes AStF as an effective solution for capturing intricate spatiotemporal patterns.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper adapts a human-centric foundation model (Sapiens) for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, yielding significant performance improvements and establishing a new state of the art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of large-scale, pre-trained human-centric foundation models in solving anatomical landmark detection tasks, which have traditionally relied on domain-specific models, and to demonstrate their underutilized capability in medical imaging.

Method: The study repurposed the human-centric foundation model, Sapiens, through multi-dataset pretraining to create MedSapiens, which is specifically designed for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. The model performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art models.

Result: MedSapiens achieved up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in success detection rate (SDR). In limited-data settings, it also achieved 2.69% improvement over the current few-shot state of the art.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models, when adapted for medical imaging, can offer substantial performance advantages over traditional models. MedSapiens sets a new benchmark in anatomical landmark detection, showcasing its adaptability and strength in low-data regimes as well.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet is a framework addressing the challenge of image authenticity verification by leveraging persistent signals in latent representations for reliable generator attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise in synthetic image and deepfake production demands effective tools for source attribution and authenticity verification.

Method: Proto-LeakNet uses signal leak analysis in latent representations, partial forward diffusion simulation, and temporal attention to enable transparent attribution of image sources.

Result: Achieving a Macro AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet demonstrates robust latent geometry that remains effective under post-processing and excels at source separability.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable tools for AI-image and deepfake forensics, surpassing current methodologies.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

*Yujie Yang,Shuang Li,Jun Ye,Neng Dong,Fan Li,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, DinoGRL, for video-based visible-infrared person re-identification, focusing on modality-invariant gait features alongside appearance cues, leading to significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance cross-modal video matching by addressing the lack of focus on modality-invariant and temporally dynamic gait features in existing methods.

Method: The paper introduces DinoGRL, which utilizes DINOv2 visual priors for gait representation learning. It incorporates the SASGL model for semantically enriched silhouette and gait feature learning, alongside the PBMGE module for bidirectional multi-granularity enhancement of gait and appearance features.

Result: Experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets show DinoGRL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in person re-identification tasks.

Conclusion: DinoGRL effectively combines appearance cues with gait features to produce robust sequence-level representations, enhancing cross-modal retrieval in person re-identification tasks.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FastGS addresses training inefficiencies in 3D Gaussian splatting methods by introducing a novel acceleration framework based on multi-view consistency, achieving significant speed-ups while maintaining rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian splatting acceleration methods are inefficient due to redundant Gaussian computations during training, leading to wasted time without effectively balancing speed and quality.

Method: FastGS employs a densification and pruning strategy grounded in multi-view consistency, eliminating traditional budgeting mechanisms to optimize the importance of Gaussians.

Result: FastGS achieves training speed accelerations of 2-15.45× across multiple benchmarks and tasks, maintaining comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods. Specific results include 3.32× acceleration on Mip-NeRF 360 and 15.45× on Deep Blending datasets.

Conclusion: FastGS is a generic and efficient framework that balances training speed and rendering quality, showcasing its applicability across various reconstruction and mapping tasks, greatly optimizing the workload compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces OMPILOT, a transformer model for translating C++ to OpenMP, improving parallelization, and proposes a new evaluation metric called OMPBLEU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient code translation to enable better shared-memory parallelization, especially in translating C++ to OpenMP for legacy code migration and reducing development challenges.

Method: OMPIOL uses a domain-specific encoder-decoder transformer with custom pre-training objectives and employs both supervised and unsupervised learning to ensure robust translation of C++ to OpenMP.

Result: The model successfully translates C++ to OpenMP code at a function level, capturing wider semantic contexts and addresses limitations in prior loop-level focused transformations.

Conclusion: OMPIOL demonstrates superior performance in translating and enhancing OpenMP parallel constructs, supported by the creation of OMPBLEU metric to ensure quality and correctness.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
accelerated progress in code translation, enabling more accurate and efficient
transformation across programming languages. While originally developed for
natural language processing, LLMs have shown strong capabilities in modeling
programming language syntax and semantics, outperforming traditional rule-based
systems in both accuracy and flexibility. These models have streamlined
cross-language conversion, reduced development overhead, and accelerated legacy
code migration. In this paper, we introduce OMPILOT, a novel domain-specific
encoder-decoder transformer tailored for translating C++ code into OpenMP,
enabling effective shared-memory parallelization. OMPILOT leverages custom
pre-training objectives that incorporate the semantics of parallel constructs
and combines both unsupervised and supervised learning strategies to improve
code translation robustness. Unlike previous work that focused primarily on
loop-level transformations, OMPILOT operates at the function level to capture a
wider semantic context. To evaluate our approach, we propose OMPBLEU, a novel
composite metric specifically crafted to assess the correctness and quality of
OpenMP parallel constructs, addressing limitations in conventional translation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The distributed nature of edge devices and their limited energy resources pose challenges in power management for real-time applications. This paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: A stochastic modeling approach using Markov Chains is applied to analyze power state transitions in edge devices, with AI-based predictive power scaling strategies studied through Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analysis.

Result: The AI-based approach minimizes unnecessary transitions, improves system responsiveness, enhances energy efficiency, and optimizes workload distribution across heterogeneous edge nodes.

Conclusion: AI-powered predictive power management strategies significantly improve energy efficiency, workload distribution, and adaptability in multi-node edge computing environments.

Abstract: Edge Computing enables low-latency processing for real-time applications but
introduces challenges in power management due to the distributed nature of edge
devices and their limited energy resources. This paper proposes a stochastic
modeling approach using Markov Chains to analyze power state transitions in
Edge Computing. By deriving steady-state probabilities and evaluating energy
consumption, we demonstrate the benefits of AI-driven predictive power scaling
over conventional reactive methods. Monte Carlo simulations validate the model,
showing strong alignment between theoretical and empirical results. Sensitivity
analysis highlights how varying transition probabilities affect power
efficiency, confirming that predictive scaling minimizes unnecessary
transitions and improves overall system responsiveness. Our findings suggest
that AI-based power management strategies significantly enhance energy
efficiency by anticipating workload demands and optimizing state transitions.
Experimental results indicate that AI-based power management optimizes workload
distribution across heterogeneous edge nodes, reducing energy consumption
disparities between devices, improving overall efficiency, and enhancing

### [112] [Parallel Spawning Strategies for Dynamic-Aware MPI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04268)
*Iker Martín-Álvarez,José I. Aliaga,Maribel Castillo,Sergio Iserte*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel parallel spawning strategy for dynamic resource management in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, significantly reducing resource reconfiguration costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic resource management in HPC can improve system utilization and reduce job waiting times, but current malleability methods are limited by high reconfiguration costs and inefficient resource handling during shrinking operations.

Method: The paper introduces a parallel spawning strategy where all processes cooperate in resource redistribution, removing shrinkage limitations and optimizing the reuse of original processes during adaptation.

Result: The proposed strategy achieves at most a 1.25x overhead for expansion and reduces shrinkage costs by at least 20x. It is validated on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and supports shared-resource environments.

Conclusion: This novel approach overcomes existing limitations, enabling better resource adaptation in HPC systems, enhancing resource allocation efficiency, and reducing workload makespan.

Abstract: Dynamic resource management is an increasingly important capability of High
Performance Computing systems, as it enables jobs to adjust their resource
allocation at runtime. This capability has been shown to reduce workload
makespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system
utilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of
applications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although
beneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the
reduction of these costs an important research topic.
  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application,
which is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes.
Other MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when
shrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across
nodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system.
This work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning
strategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution,
thereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage
limitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and
reducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times
with at most a $1.25\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations
that reduce their cost by at least $20\times$. This strategy has been validated
on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and can also be applied in
shared-resource environments.

### [113] [Enabling Dynamic Sparsity in Quantized LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04477)
*Rongxiang Wang,Kangyuan Shu,Felix Xiaozhu Lin*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes techniques for making large language models (LLMs) more efficient on limited GPUs by combining dynamic sparsity with low-bit quantization, achieving faster performance without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of LLMs on end-user devices is limited by the restricted memory and computational capacity of mobile and desktop GPUs. There is a need to optimize these models for responsiveness, privacy, and cost-effectiveness while dealing with challenges like activation sparsity and quantization compatibility.

Method: The authors developed a method combining: (1) zigzag-patterned quantization layouts that align with activation sparsity, improving memory efficiency; (2) a GEMV kernel tailored for this layout to optimize parallel computing; and (3) lightweight runtime mechanisms to handle sparse indices efficiently.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrated up to 1.55x faster decoding throughput on various model scales and hardware setups while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference.

Conclusion: Structured sparsity and low-bit quantization can work well together on commodity GPUs, providing an effective way to deploy LLMs efficiently on constrained hardware without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on end-user devices is gaining
importance due to benefits in responsiveness, privacy, and operational cost.
Yet the limited memory and compute capability of mobile and desktop GPUs make
efficient execution difficult. Recent observations suggest that the internal
activations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,
only part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity
could reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,
which remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained
hardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of
techniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.
The method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes
weights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory
locality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully
utilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that
gathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and
hardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding
throughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,
showing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on
commodity GPUs.

### [114] [A New Probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure Model for Self-Protecting Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04523)
*Silvia Bonomi,Giovanni Farina,Roy Friedman,Eviatar B. Procaccia,Sebastien Tixeuil*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a probabilistic model to enhance self-protection in distributed systems against Byzantine attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed systems are vulnerable to advanced security threats, and current models do not fully reflect real-world attack dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a probabilistic Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) model integrated with MAPE-K architecture for analyzing attack dynamics and guiding reconfiguration strategies.

Result: Mathematical analysis and simulations demonstrate the system's ability to respond to Byzantine failures by considering infection spreading rates and recovery rates.

Conclusion: The proposed model improves the understanding and management of security threats in distributed systems, enhancing their resilience to evolving attacks.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems face growing security threats, as attackers
continuously enhance their skills and vulnerabilities span across the entire
system stack, from hardware to the application layer. In the system design
phase, fault tolerance techniques can be employed to safeguard systems. From a
theoretical perspective, an attacker attempting to compromise a system can be
abstracted by considering the presence of Byzantine processes in the system.
Although this approach enhances the resilience of the distributed system, it
introduces certain limitations regarding the accuracy of the model in
reflecting real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider a self-protecting
distributed system based on the \emph{Monitoring-Analyse-Plan-Execute over a
shared Knowledge} (MAPE-K) architecture, and we propose a new probabilistic
Mobile Byzantine Failure (MBF) that can be plugged into the Analysis component.
Our new model captures the dynamics of evolving attacks and can be used to
drive the self-protection and reconfiguration strategy. We analyze
mathematically the time that it takes until the number of Byzantine nodes
crosses given thresholds, or for the system to self-recover back into a safe
state, depending on the rates of Byzantine infection spreading \emph{vs.} the
rate of self-recovery. We also provide simulation results that illustrate the
behavior of the system under such assumptions.

*Petr Kuznetsov,Nathan Josia Schrodt*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper discusses dynamic concurrency in distributed computing and proposes a model to detect and manage conflicts efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce synchronization obstacles in distributed computing due to their negative impact on scalability, particularly in scenarios where conflicts occur infrequently.

Method: The introduction of dynamic concurrency, which employs strong synchronization only when necessary, based on current system states.

Result: The authors define dynamic concurrency and present a dynamically concurrent universal construction to address synchronization challenges.

Conclusion: Dynamic concurrency is shown to minimize unnecessary synchronization, enhancing scalability and efficiency in distributed computing.

Abstract: Synchronization is the major obstacle to scalability in distributed
computing. Concurrent operations on the shared data engage in synchronization
when they encounter a \emph{conflict}, i.e., their effects depend on the order
in which they are applied. Ideally, one would like to detect conflicts in a
\emph{dynamic} manner, i.e., adjusting to the current system state. Indeed, it
is very common that two concurrent operations conflict only in some rarely
occurring states. In this paper, we define the notion of \emph{dynamic
concurrency}: an operation employs strong synchronization primitives only if it
\emph{has} to arbitrate with concurrent operations, given the current system
state. We then present a dynamically concurrent universal construction.

### [116] [One Size Does Not Fit All: Architecture-Aware Adaptive Batch Scheduling with DEBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03809)
*François Belias,Naser Ezzati-Jivan,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEBA, a batch scheduler that dynamically adapts batch sizes using gradient and loss variation data, achieving significant training acceleration and accuracy improvements for certain architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive batch size methods assume uniform adaptation strategies across all architectures, which may not be effective. There is a need for an architecture-aware approach to efficiently adapt batch sizes and enhance training speed and accuracy.

Method: DEBA uses gradient variance, gradient norm variation, and loss variation as metrics to guide batch size adjustments. It includes a baseline characterization framework and emphasizes sliding window statistics and cooldown periods for adaptation.

Result: DEBA exhibited significant speedups (up to 62%) and accuracy improvements (1-7%) on lightweight/mid-depth architectures while showing varying effectiveness across other architecture types. Results highlighted that adaptation benefits depend on architecture-specific characteristics.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence that adaptive batch size methods require architecture-aware designs to achieve optimal performance, challenging the one-size-fits-all assumption in adaptive methodologies.

Abstract: Adaptive batch size methods aim to accelerate neural network training, but
existing approaches apply identical adaptation strategies across all
architectures, assuming a one-size-fits-all solution. We introduce DEBA
(Dynamic Efficient Batch Adaptation), an adaptive batch scheduler that monitors
gradient variance, gradient norm variation and loss variation to guide batch
size adaptations. Through systematic evaluation across six architectures
(ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNet-V3, ViT-B16) on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with five random seeds per configuration, we
demonstrate that the architecture fundamentally determines adaptation efficacy.
Our findings reveal that: (1) lightweight and medium-depth architectures
(MobileNet-V3, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) achieve a 45-62% training speedup
with simultaneous accuracy improvements of 1-7%; (2) shallow residual networks
(ResNet-18) show consistent gains of +2.4 - 4.0% in accuracy, 36 - 43% in
speedup, while deep residual networks (ResNet-50) exhibit high variance and
occasional degradation; (3) already-stable architectures (ViT-B16) show minimal
speedup (6%) despite maintaining accuracy, indicating that adaptation benefits
vary with baseline optimization characteristics. We introduce a baseline
characterization framework using gradient stability metrics (stability score,
gradient norm variation) that predicts which architectures will benefit from
adaptive scheduling. Our ablation studies reveal critical design choices often
overlooked in prior work: sliding window statistics (vs. full history) and
sufficient cooldown periods (5+ epochs) between adaptations are essential for
success. This work challenges the prevailing assumption that adaptive methods
generalize across architectures and provides the first systematic evidence that
batch size adaptation requires an architecture-aware design.

Motivation: Address limitations in current grass growth forecasting methods to enhance profitability and sustainability in Irish dairy farming.

Method: Development of deep learning univariate models, specifically a temporal convolutional network, tested using historical grass growth data.

Result: High forecasting performance with RMSE of 2.74 and MAE of 3.46 on 34 years of data, offering reliable and efficient models.

Conclusion: The study contributes to better grass growth forecasting, supporting sustainable practices in the Irish dairy sector.

Abstract: Grasslands, constituting the world's second-largest terrestrial carbon sink,
play a crucial role in biodiversity and the regulation of the carbon cycle.
Currently, the Irish dairy sector, a significant economic contributor, grapples
with challenges related to profitability and sustainability. Presently, grass
growth forecasting relies on impractical mechanistic models. In response, we
propose deep learning models tailored for univariate datasets, presenting
cost-effective alternatives. Notably, a temporal convolutional network designed
for forecasting Perennial Ryegrass growth in Cork exhibits high performance,
leveraging historical grass height data with RMSE of 2.74 and MAE of 3.46.
Validation across a comprehensive dataset spanning 1,757 weeks over 34 years
provides insights into optimal model configurations. This study enhances our
understanding of model behavior, thereby improving reliability in grass growth
forecasting and contributing to the advancement of sustainable dairy farming
practices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a federated learning-based framework using 2D GAF image transformations and CNNs for ECG classification in IoT healthcare, achieving high accuracy (95.18%) while preserving data privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address privacy concerns and computational challenges in ECG data classification within IoT healthcare environments, utilizing federated learning and edge devices for secure and efficient data analysis.

Method: The method involves transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D GAF images for feature extraction via CNNs, deploying federated learning across heterogeneous IoT devices, and testing the framework's feasibility by integrating edge devices and a cloud server.

Result: The framework achieves a high ECG classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly better than single-client setups, while maintaining efficient communication and resource use.

Conclusion: This framework demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for scalable IoT-based healthcare systems, merging edge and cloud resources effectively to support secure and efficient health monitoring.

Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for
privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things
(IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian
Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature
extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that
sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the
first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across
heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication
efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the
framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,
reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results
demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of
95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client
baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational
complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource
utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential
of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring,
supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.

*Xuan Ouyang,Senan Wang,Bouzhou Wang,Siyuan Xiahou,Jinrong Zhou,Yuekang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "LOLGORITHM," a system for generating diverse and culturally adaptive comments for short-video platforms, employing a modular multi-agent system and multimodal language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of creating platform-compliant yet stylistically diverse and contextually relevant comments for short-video platforms, enhancing user engagement and creativity.

Method: The proposed system, LOLGORITHM, uses multi-agent segmentation, contextual analysis, affective computing, and style prompts to generate comments in six distinct styles with the help of a multimodal large language model (MLLM).

Result: Evaluation on a bilingual dataset (Douyin and YouTube) shows LOLGORITHM outperforms baselines, with human preference rates exceeding 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on YouTube.

Conclusion: LOLGORITHM provides a scalable, adaptive framework for creative comment generation on short-video platforms, facilitating improved user engagement and cultural connectivity.

Abstract: Short-video platforms have become a central medium in the modern Internet
landscape, where efficient information delivery and strong interactivity are
reshaping user engagement and cultural dissemination. Among the various forms
of user interaction, comments play a vital role in fostering community
participation and enabling content re-creation. However, generating comments
that are both compliant with platform guidelines and capable of exhibiting
stylistic diversity and contextual awareness remains a significant challenge.
We introduce LOLGORITHM, a modular multi-agent system (MAS) designed for
controllable short-video comment generation. The system integrates video
segmentation, contextual and affective analysis, and style-aware prompt
construction. It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),
rhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content
extraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM
directly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through
explicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and
evaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin
(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy
skits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk
shows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style
conformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and
105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms
baseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on
YouTube. This work presents a scalable and culturally adaptive framework for
stylized comment generation on short-video platforms, offering a promising path
to enhance user engagement and creative interaction.

*Berk Iskar,Michael Taynnan Barros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biologically inspired anomaly detection framework using astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning for robust and adaptive detection, achieving superior performance with negligible runtime overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline-trained network anomaly detection systems are prone to concept drift and new threats like zero-day attacks, necessitating a more adaptable and robust solution.

Method: The authors combine a deep neural network (DNN) with a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator based on astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling mechanisms to enable adaptive learning.

Result: On CTU-13 network traffic dataset, the proposed model achieves ~98% accuracy, outperforming standard DNNs with reduced false positives and negatives, demonstrating effectiveness in anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The presented biologically plausible Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework provides an effective solution for adaptive streaming anomaly detection, applicable beyond cybersecurity domains.

Abstract: Network anomaly detection systems encounter several challenges with
traditional detectors trained offline. They become susceptible to concept drift
and new threats such as zero-day or polymorphic attacks. To address this
limitation, we propose a Ca$^{2+}$-modulated learning framework that draws
inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.

### [121] [What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768)
*Candace Ross,Florian Bordes,Adina Williams,Polina Kirichenko,Mark Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a benchmark, Common-O, for multimodal language models to evaluate reasoning in real-world multi-scene settings. It highlights their performance gaps despite success in perception tasks, with the best model scoring only 35%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between strong performance by multimodal language models in standard benchmarks and their hallucinations/errors in real-world reasoning tasks.

Method: Designing a novel benchmark, Common-O, with over 10.5k examples of in-the-wild scenes and cognitive-inspired tests. Evaluating leading multimodal models, including reasoning-specific ones, on this dataset.

Result: Multimodal models perform well in single-image perception tasks but struggle with reasoning across multiple scenes. Best model scores 35% on Common-O and 1% on more complex scenes.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals challenges in reasoning and hallucination in multimodal models, suggesting improvements through scaled multi-image training techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an
open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from
hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap
between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks
that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,
we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With
more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training
data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by
cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's
in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models
specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that
perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning
across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning
models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best
performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,
consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,
we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present
in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen
during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide
modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs
show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer
promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the
challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents DSRPGO, a multimodal protein function prediction method using dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training, achieving superior results in hierarchical multi-label prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of using complex multimodal protein features (from structure, sequence, attributes, and networks) to predict protein functions.

Method: DSRPGO utilizes reconstructive pre-training for fine-grained information, a Bidirectional Interaction Module for feature interaction, and a Dynamic Selection Module for hierarchical multi-label classification.

Result: DSRPGO demonstrates significant improvement in predicting BPO, MFO, and CCO on human protein datasets, surpassing benchmark models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates multimodal features and dynamically adapts to hierarchical classifications, highlighting its potential for advanced protein function prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function
prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information,
ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and
interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex
interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function
prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive
pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce
reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low
semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module
(BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features.
Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label
classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to
select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein
function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO,
MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.

*Jaden Park,Mu Cai,Feng Yao,Jingbo Shang,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new detection method for identifying contaminated Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and validates its robustness against various contamination strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns arise over inflated performance in VLMs due to test-set leakage from proprietary pretraining corpora. Current methods either decontaminate or redesign benchmarks, missing effective detection techniques for contaminated VLMs.

Method: The authors intentionally contaminate open-source VLMs with benchmark data, analyze failures in existing detection methods, and propose a novel detection method based on multi-modal semantic perturbation.

Result: The proposed method showed that contaminated VLMs fail to generalize under controlled semantic perturbations. Tests across different contamination strategies proved its robustness.

Conclusion: The study introduces a reliable detection approach for contaminated VLMs, addressing test-set leakage concerns. Public release of code and datasets ensures accessible validation and future improvements.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on numerous benchmark tasks. However, the use of
internet-scale, often proprietary, pretraining corpora raises a critical
concern for both practitioners and users: inflated performance due to test-set
leakage. While prior works have proposed mitigation strategies such as
decontamination of pretraining data and benchmark redesign for LLMs, the
complementary direction of developing detection methods for contaminated VLMs
remains underexplored. To address this gap, we deliberately contaminate
open-source VLMs on popular benchmarks and show that existing detection
approaches either fail outright or exhibit inconsistent behavior. We then
propose a novel simple yet effective detection method based on multi-modal
semantic perturbation, demonstrating that contaminated models fail to
generalize under controlled perturbations. Finally, we validate our approach
across multiple realistic contamination strategies, confirming its robustness
and effectiveness. The code and perturbed dataset will be released publicly.

*Linghui Zeng,Ruixuan Liu,Atiquer Rahman Sarkar,Xiaoqian Jiang,Joyce C. Ho,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FusionDP, a framework tailored for feature-level differential privacy to enhance model utility while preserving privacy, especially for sensitive demographic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the excessive noise and utility degradation in existing privacy-preserving methods like DP-SGD applied uniformly across all features, focusing on scenarios where only a subset of features requires privacy protection.

Method: FusionDP involves two steps: (1) using foundation models to impute sensitive features based on non-sensitive ones as external priors, and (2) employing a modified DP-SGD algorithm to train models on both original and imputed features while ensuring privacy for the sensitive ones.

Result: FusionDP significantly improves model performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy compared to traditional privacy-preserving methods, demonstrated through evaluations on sepsis prediction and clinical note classification tasks.

Conclusion: This study highlights the efficacy of foundation model-driven imputation in enhancing the privacy-utility balance for different modalities, representing a promising approach for feature-level differential privacy in machine learning.

Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in
privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy
protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU
data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due
to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally
less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features
in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility
degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model
utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages
large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive
features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates
of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model
training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models
on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of
the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a
sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note
classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving
baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model
performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the
potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility
trade-off for various modalities.

*Shivogo John*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes adaptive explanation frameworks to address challenges in credit scoring caused by evolving borrower behaviors and concept drift, improving stability and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional credit scoring explanations fail under concept drift, leading to unstable and unfair interpretations. This study aims to enhance interpretability and fairness as credit models evolve.

Method: Using a multi-year credit dataset, the paper integrates XGBoost modeling with three adaptive SHAP variants that address feature distribution shifts, rebaseline explanations, and calibrate surrogates.

Result: Adaptive methods improved temporal stability, fairness across demographic groups, and robustness under drift, without reducing predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: Adaptive explainability frameworks sustain transparency, fairness, and ethical reliability in credit scoring systems and decision models under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: Evolving borrower behaviors, shifting economic conditions, and changing
regulatory landscapes continuously reshape the data distributions underlying
modern credit-scoring systems. Conventional explainability techniques, such as
SHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their
explanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This
study addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks
that recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit
models. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via
XGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation
reweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP
rebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate
calibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked
against static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,
F1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness
(demographic parity and recalibration). Results show that adaptive methods,
particularly rebaselined and surrogate-based explanations, substantially
improve temporal stability and reduce disparate impact across demographic
groups without degrading predictive accuracy. Robustness tests, including
counterfactual perturbations, background sensitivity analysis, and
proxy-variable detection, confirm the resilience of adaptive explanations under
real-world drift conditions. These findings establish adaptive explainability
as a practical mechanism for sustaining transparency, accountability, and
ethical reliability in data-driven credit systems, and more broadly, in any
domain where decision models evolve with population change.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using routing to assign tasks to the smallest capable reasoning model, reducing computation costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning language models are effective but expensive in terms of computational resources, creating a need for more efficient deployment strategies.

Method: The authors use intermediate data representations to train lightweight predictors, which help route problems across models based on difficulty or expected accuracy.

Result: On math benchmarks, the routing approach reduces computational requirements while achieving accuracy comparable to larger models.

Conclusion: Difficulty-aware routing is an effective strategy for deploying reasoning models in a cost-efficient way.

Abstract: Reasoning language models perform well on complex tasks but are costly to
deploy due to their size and long reasoning traces. We propose a routing
approach that assigns each problem to the smallest model likely to solve it,
reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy. Using intermediate
representations from s1.1-32B, we train lightweight predictors of problem
difficulty or model correctness to guide routing across a pool of reasoning
models. On diverse math benchmarks, routing improves efficiency over random
assignment and matches s1.1-32B's performance while using significantly less
compute. Our results demonstrate that difficulty-aware routing is effective for
cost-efficient deployment of reasoning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Sketched Random Features" to overcome Graph Neural Networks' limitations like oversquashing, oversmoothing, and limited expressive power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks, such as difficulty capturing long-range dependencies and limitations in expressive power.

Method: Randomized global embeddings termed as "Sketched Random Features" are injected into GNNs to enhance their capability to manage long-range dependencies and overcome oversquashing and oversmoothing.

Result: The addition of Sketched Random Features consistently improves GNN performance in real-world tasks and complements existing methods such as graph positional encodings.

Conclusion: Injecting randomized global embeddings is an effective standalone solution and a complementary improvement for enhancing Graph Neural Networks' performance and addressing known challenges.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks learn on graph-structured data by iteratively
aggregating local neighborhood information. While this local message passing
paradigm imparts a powerful inductive bias and exploits graph sparsity, it also
yields three key challenges: (i) oversquashing of long-range information, (ii)
oversmoothing of node representations, and (iii) limited expressive power. In
this work we inject randomized global embeddings of node features, which we
term \textit{Sketched Random Features}, into standard GNNs, enabling them to
efficiently capture long-range dependencies. The embeddings are unique,
distance-sensitive, and topology-agnostic -- properties which we analytically
and empirically show alleviate the aforementioned limitations when injected
into GNNs. Experimental results on real-world graph learning tasks confirm that
this strategy consistently improves performance over baseline GNNs, offering
both a standalone solution and a complementary enhancement to existing
techniques such as graph positional encodings. Our source code is available at

*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes StratDiff, a novel method to smooth transitions from offline to online reinforcement learning by leveraging distributional structures in the offline dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition from offline to online RL is challenging due to distributional shifts between the fixed offline dataset and the policy evolving during online learning. Existing methods rarely focus on the distributional properties of offline data, leaving a gap in adapting strategies to sample types.

Method: StratDiff utilizes a diffusion model to learn prior knowledge from offline data, refining it through energy-based functions to enhance policy imitation. It stratifies training samples into offline-like and online-like subsets based on KL divergence, applying offline or online learning objectives accordingly.

Result: StratDiff, integrated with Cal-QL and IQL methods, significantly improves adaptability and stability in RL tasks, outperforming existing techniques on D4RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: StratDiff effectively tackles offline-to-online RL challenges by utilizing a distributional and stratification-based approach, advancing performance and adaptability across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses
critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior
policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning.
Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly
assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself,
leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of
samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method,
Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother
transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to
learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge
through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate
offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the
generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each
sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and
online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives,
while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL
and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and
more stable performance across diverse RL settings.

### [129] [Higher-Order Causal Structure Learning with Additive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03831)
*James Enouen,Yujia Zheng,Ignavier Ng,Yan Liu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to extend causal additive models to incorporate higher-order interactions using directed acyclic hypergraphs, providing theoretical tools, identifiability results, and an extended greedy algorithm for practical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the prevalence of higher-order mechanisms in real-world processes, existing approaches to causal structure learning focus mainly on simpler causal models, neglecting the complexity of interactions.

Method: The authors propose extending causal additive models with higher-order interactions and representing these interactions using directed acyclic hypergraphs (hyper DAGs). They also provide theoretical definitions, identifiability results, and develop a generalized CAM algorithm.

Result: The analysis shows the benefits of modeling higher-order interactions in causal discovery, yielding better empirical results under more restrictive assumptions and offering improved finite sample complexity.

Conclusion: Handling higher-order interactions in causal discovery using directed acyclic hypergraphs provides both theoretical and empirical benefits, improving structure learning in complex causal systems.

Abstract: Causal structure learning has long been the central task of inferring causal
insights from data. Despite the abundance of real-world processes exhibiting
higher-order mechanisms, however, an explicit treatment of interactions in
causal discovery has received little attention. In this work, we focus on
extending the causal additive model (CAM) to additive models with higher-order
interactions. This second level of modularity we introduce to the structure
learning problem is most easily represented by a directed acyclic hypergraph
which extends the DAG. We introduce the necessary definitions and theoretical
tools to handle the novel structure we introduce and then provide
identifiability results for the hyper DAG, extending the typical Markov
equivalence classes. We next provide insights into why learning the more
complex hypergraph structure may actually lead to better empirical results. In
particular, more restrictive assumptions like CAM correspond to easier-to-learn
hyper DAGs and better finite sample complexity. We finally develop an extension
of the greedy CAM algorithm which can handle the more complex hyper DAG search
space and demonstrate its empirical usefulness in synthetic experiments.

### [130] [Enhancing Q-Value Updates in Deep Q-Learning via Successor-State Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03836)
*Lipeng Zu,Hansong Zhou,Xiaonan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The proposed Successor-state Aggregation Deep Q-Network (SADQ) introduces a method to reduce variance in Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) updates by explicitly modeling environment dynamics and successor-state distributions for better value estimation and policy alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high variance in DQN updates caused by suboptimal policies and poorly aligned sampled transitions.

Method: The authors propose SADQ, which integrates successor-state distributions into Q-value estimation and explores efficient action selection using a stochastic transition model.

Result: SADQ demonstrates consistent superiority over DQN variants in terms of stability and learning efficiency, validated through experiments on RL benchmarks and control tasks.

Conclusion: SADQ provides unbiased value estimates with reduced training variance, addressing critical limitations of traditional DQNs and improving reinforcement learning performance.

Abstract: Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) estimate future returns by learning from transitions
sampled from a replay buffer. However, the target updates in DQN often rely on
next states generated by actions from past, potentially suboptimal, policy. As
a result, these states may not provide informative learning signals, causing
high variance into the update process. This issue is exacerbated when the
sampled transitions are poorly aligned with the agent's current policy. To
address this limitation, we propose the Successor-state Aggregation Deep
Q-Network (SADQ), which explicitly models environment dynamics using a
stochastic transition model. SADQ integrates successor-state distributions into
the Q-value estimation process, enabling more stable and policy-aligned value
updates. Additionally, it explores a more efficient action selection strategy
with the modeled transition structure. We provide theoretical guarantees that
SADQ maintains unbiased value estimates while reducing training variance. Our
extensive empirical results across standard RL benchmarks and real-world
vector-based control tasks demonstrate that SADQ consistently outperforms DQN
variants in both stability and learning efficiency.

### [131] [Conditional Score Learning for Quickest Change Detection in Markov Transition Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03953)
*Wuxia Chen,Taposh Banerjee,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel quickest change detection method for high-dimensional Markov processes with unknown transition dynamics, relying on a score-based CUSUM mechanism using conditional Hyvarinen score differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quick change detection in Markov processes is crucial but challenging, especially when transition dynamics are unknown. This paper aims to address this by leveraging score-based learning methods.

Method: The method involves estimating conditional scores from sample pairs and employing a score-based CUSUM procedure with truncated statistics to ensure bounded increments. The approach builds theoretical guarantees via Hoeffding's inequality and asymptotic delay assessments.

Result: The proposed method achieves both theoretical guarantees (exponential bounds on false alarms, asymptotic bounds on detection delay) and practical feasibility for change detection in high-dimensional Markov models.

Conclusion: The score-based CUSUM procedure provides a practical and theoretically robust framework for detecting changes in high-dimensional Markov processes, avoiding explicit likelihood evaluations.

Abstract: We address the problem of quickest change detection in Markov processes with
unknown transition kernels. The key idea is to learn the conditional score
$\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$ directly from sample pairs
$( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where both $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are
high-dimensional data generated by the same transition kernel. In this way, we
avoid explicit likelihood evaluation and provide a practical way to learn the
transition dynamics. Based on this estimation, we develop a score-based CUSUM
procedure that uses conditional Hyvarinen score differences to detect changes
in the kernel. To ensure bounded increments, we propose a truncated version of
the statistic. With Hoeffding's inequality for uniformly ergodic Markov
processes, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mean time to false alarm.
We also prove asymptotic upper bounds on detection delay. These results give
both theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility for score-based detection
in high-dimensional Markov models.

### [132] [Benchmark Datasets for Lead-Lag Forecasting on Social Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03877)
*Kimia Kazemian,Zhenzhen Liu,Yangfanyu Yang,Katie Z Luo,Shuhan Gu,Audrey Du,Xinyu Yang,Jack Jansons,Kilian Q Weinberger,John Thickstun,Yian Yin,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF) as a framework to predict delayed outcomes based on early interactions in social and collaborative platforms. It presents benchmark datasets and methodologies for LLF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of systematic treatment of LLF in time-series studies and provide datasets for the exploration of long-term dynamics in social and usage data.

Method: The authors curated high-volume benchmark datasets (arXiv and GitHub), conducted statistical and classification validation, and tested both parametric and non-parametric regression models.

Result: The study establishes two datasets (arXiv and GitHub) displaying lead-lag dynamics, documents data processing techniques, validates predictions statistically, and benchmarks regression methods.

Conclusion: LLF is presented as a new forecasting paradigm, with empirical foundations to explore social and usage data dynamics over long horizons, supported by publicly accessible datasets.

Abstract: Social and collaborative platforms emit multivariate time-series traces in
which early interactions-such as views, likes, or downloads-are followed,
sometimes months or years later, by higher impact like citations, sales, or
reviews. We formalize this setting as Lead-Lag Forecasting (LLF): given an
early usage channel (the lead), predict a correlated but temporally shifted
outcome channel (the lag). Despite the ubiquity of such patterns, LLF has not
been treated as a unified forecasting problem within the time-series community,
largely due to the absence of standardized datasets. To anchor research in LLF,
here we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations
of 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and
outline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including
Wikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),
e-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->
messages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by
capturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of
outcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all
technical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of
lead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked
parametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes
LLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its
systematic exploration in social and usage data. Our data portal with downloads
and documentation is available at https://lead-lag-forecasting.github.io/.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how the stochastic Gauss-Newton (SGN) method affects convergence and generalization in deep learning, deriving bounds on both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effects of higher-order optimization methods like SGN on generalization performance in deep neural networks.

Method: Analyzes SGN with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks using variable-metric analysis and uniform stability.

Result: Establishes finite-time convergence bounds and identifies non-asymptotic generalization bounds depending on parameters like batch size, network width, and depth.

Conclusion: SGN can achieve favorable generalization regimes, where larger minimum eigenvalues of the Gauss-Newton matrix result in tighter generalization stability bounds.

Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization
methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic
Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch
sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth
activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric
analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size,
network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds
for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing
the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization
performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime
for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along
the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DecoHD, a method for effectively compressing hyperdimensional computing with minimal accuracy loss, achieving significant memory reduction and hardware performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that reduces the memory footprint of hyperdimensional computing (HDC) without compromising accuracy and robustness.

Method: DecoHD learns directly within a decomposed HDC framework, using compact factors with per-layer channels, multiplicative binding, and a bundling head, preserving HDC's operations and allowing end-to-end training.

Result: DecoHD demonstrates extreme memory savings with slight accuracy loss (approximately 0.1-0.15% on average), resilience to noise, significant reduction in trainable parameters (up to ~97%), and substantial hardware efficiency gains in energy and speed.

Conclusion: DecoHD successfully shrinks HDC networks while balancing memory efficiency, robustness, and performance, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained applications and hardware acceleration.

Abstract: Decomposition is a proven way to shrink deep networks without changing I/O.
We bring this idea to hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where footprint cuts
usually shrink the feature axis and erode concentration and robustness. Prior
HDC decompositions decode via fixed atomic hypervectors, which are ill-suited
for compressing learned class prototypes. We introduce DecoHD, which learns
directly in a decomposed HDC parameterization: a small, shared set of per-layer
channels with multiplicative binding across layers and bundling at the end,
yielding a large representational space from compact factors. DecoHD compresses
along the class axis via a lightweight bundling head while preserving native
bind-bundle-score; training is end-to-end, and inference remains pure HDC,
aligning with in/near-memory accelerators. In evaluation, DecoHD attains
extreme memory savings with only minor accuracy degradation under tight
deployment budgets. On average it stays within about 0.1-0.15% of a strong
non-reduced HDC baseline (worst case 5.7%), is more robust to random bit-flip
noise, reaches its accuracy plateau with up to ~97% fewer trainable parameters,
and -- in hardware -- delivers roughly 277x/35x energy/speed gains over a CPU
(AMD Ryzen 9 9950X), 13.5x/3.7x over a GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090), and 2.0x/2.4x
over a baseline HDC ASIC.

*Ekin Uğurel,Cynthia Chen,Brian H. Y. Lee,Filipe Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve the inference of sociodemographic traits using innovative mobility descriptors, uncertainty metrics, and multitask learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address difficulties in inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data due to weak correlations and limited generalization.

Method: They develop higher-order mobility descriptors using directed mobility graphs, introduce metrics for uncertainty, and implement a multitask learning framework.

Result: The proposed approaches enhance prediction accuracy and generalization, particularly in limited or varied datasets.

Conclusion: The methods improve prediction accuracy, interpretability, and generalization, aiding transportation planners in leveraging mobility data effectively.

Abstract: Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the predictive performance and uncertainty calibration of deep ensemble models by investigating the benefits of jointly tuning certain parameters.

Method: Jointly tunes weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping while proposing a partially overlapping holdout strategy to balance data utilization and evaluation.

Result: Jointly tuning ensembles generally matches or improves performance, with variability depending on tasks and metrics.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of hyperparameters in deep ensembles is beneficial, and the overlapping holdout strategy is a practical tool for balancing trade-offs during training.

Abstract: Deep ensembles are a powerful tool in machine learning, improving both model
performance and uncertainty calibration. While ensembles are typically formed
by training and tuning models individually, evidence suggests that jointly
tuning the ensemble can lead to better performance. This paper investigates the
impact of jointly tuning weight decay, temperature scaling, and early stopping
on both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, we
propose a partially overlapping holdout strategy as a practical compromise
between enabling joint evaluation and maximizing the use of data for training.
Our results demonstrate that jointly tuning the ensemble generally matches or
improves performance, with significant variation in effect size across
different tasks and metrics. We highlight the trade-offs between individual and
joint optimization in deep ensemble training, with the overlapping holdout
strategy offering an attractive practical solution. We believe our findings
provide valuable insights and guidance for practitioners looking to optimize
deep ensemble models. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing real-world challenges in scenarios where data collection is limited due to cost or privacy constraints by ranking synthetic datasets based on their usefulness for real-world tasks.

Method: Develop proxy metrics and benchmarks to estimate synthetic dataset quality, including adapting distribution and diversity-based measures, and introducing LENS, a reasoning approach leveraging large language models.

Result: SynQuE proxies are shown to correlate with real task performance across diverse settings, and LENS surpasses others in complex tasks, significantly boosting task-specific performance such as in Text2SQL parsing.

Conclusion: SynQuE offers a practical way to select synthetic data under data scarcity, opens pathways for research in foundation model-based data analysis, and improves task performance in varied domains.

Abstract: We introduce and formalize the Synthetic Dataset Quality Estimation (SynQuE)
problem: ranking synthetic datasets by their expected real-world task
performance using only limited unannotated real data. This addresses a critical
and open challenge where data is scarce due to collection costs or privacy
constraints. We establish the first comprehensive benchmarks for this problem
by introducing and evaluating proxy metrics that choose synthetic data for
training to maximize task performance on real data. We introduce the first
proxy metrics for SynQuE by adapting distribution and diversity-based distance
measures to our context via embedding models. To address the shortcomings of
these metrics on complex planning tasks, we propose LENS, a novel proxy that
leverages large language model reasoning. Our results show that SynQuE proxies
correlate with real task performance across diverse tasks, including sentiment
analysis, Text2SQL, web navigation, and image classification, with LENS
consistently outperforming others on complex tasks by capturing nuanced
characteristics. For instance, on text-to-SQL parsing, training on the top-3
synthetic datasets selected via SynQuE proxies can raise accuracy from 30.4% to
38.4 (+8.1)% on average compared to selecting data indiscriminately. This work
establishes SynQuE as a practical framework for synthetic data selection under
real-data scarcity and motivates future research on foundation model-based data
characterization and fine-grained data selection.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ForecastGAN, a novel framework for multi-horizon time series forecasting that integrates numerical and categorical features and addresses shortcomings of existing models, yielding better short-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods struggle with short-term predictions and do not adequately incorporate categorical features. There is a need for a unified framework providing robust and generalizable predictions across diverse contexts.

Method: ForecastGAN combines a Decomposition Module for extracting seasonality and trends, a Model Selection Module for optimizing neural network configurations for specific horizons, and an Adversarial Training Module for robust predictions using Conditional GANs.

Result: ForecastGAN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art transformer models in short-term forecasting and remains competitive for long-term predictions across eleven benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The research presents a more adaptable and efficient framework for time series prediction, capable of handling diverse data features and forecasting scenarios without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Motivation: The paper aims to assess the efficacy of B-EPGP against CN-FEM for solving complex PDEs accurately and efficiently.

Method: A benchmarking study using a new Gaussian Process-based method (B-EPGP) alongside CN-FEM with a degrees-of-freedom matching protocol for fairness.

Result: B-EPGP demonstrates significantly lower errors, about a two-order magnitude improvement over CN-FEM in solving the wave equation.

Conclusion: B-EPGP outperforms CN-FEM in terms of accuracy for solving the wave equation, showcasing potential for higher fidelity PDE solutions.

Abstract: We present a new benchmarking study comparing a boundary-constrained
Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Process (B-EPGP) surrogate with a classical
finite element method combined with Crank--Nicolson time stepping (CN-FEM) for
solving the two-dimensional wave equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The B-EPGP construction leverages exponential-polynomial bases
derived from the characteristic variety to enforce the PDE and boundary
conditions exactly and employs penalized least squares to estimate the
coefficients. To ensure fairness across paradigms, we introduce a
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) matching protocol. Under matched DoF, B-EPGP
consistently attains lower space-time $L^2$-error and maximum-in-time
$L^{2}$-error in space than CN-FEM, improving accuracy by roughly two orders of

*Sanggeon Yun,Hyunwoo Oh,Ryozo Masukawa,Pietro Mercati,Nathaniel D. Bastian,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LogHD proposes a novel method for reducing memory cost in Hyperdimensional Computing while improving robustness and maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Hyperdimensional Computing models require significant memory storage, which is inefficient for constrained systems. Previous efforts to reduce memory weaken robustness.

Method: LogHD reduces memory usage by replacing per-class prototypes with bundle hypervectors in a logarithmic class-axis arrangement, paired with capacity-aware codebooks and profile-based decoding.

Result: LogHD achieves competitive accuracy, improved resilience against errors, energy efficiency, and speedups in comparison to previous methods and hardware platforms.

Conclusion: LogHD demonstrates promising improvements in memory efficiency, accuracy, and resilience, particularly for constrained computing systems.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) suits memory, energy, and
reliability-constrained systems, yet the standard "one prototype per class"
design requires $O(CD)$ memory (with $C$ classes and dimensionality $D$). Prior
compaction reduces $D$ (feature axis), improving storage/compute but weakening
robustness. We introduce LogHD, a logarithmic class-axis reduction that
replaces the $C$ per-class prototypes with $n\!\approx\!\lceil\log_k C\rceil$
bundle hypervectors (alphabet size $k$) and decodes in an $n$-dimensional
activation space, cutting memory to $O(D\log_k C)$ while preserving $D$. LogHD
uses a capacity-aware codebook and profile-based decoding, and composes with
feature-axis sparsification. Across datasets and injected bit flips, LogHD
attains competitive accuracy with smaller models and higher resilience at
matched memory. Under equal memory, it sustains target accuracy at roughly

*Ben Sanati,Thomas L. Lee,Trevor McInroe,Aidan Scannell,Nikolay Malkin,David Abel,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forgetting in learning algorithms is linked to a lack of self-consistency in predictions, characterized by loss of predictive information. Authors propose a general measure and validate it experimentally across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absence of a unified definition of forgetting in learning algorithms and understand its impact on learning dynamics.

Method: Authors developed a task-agnostic theory framing forgetting as inconsistent predictive distributions, validated by experiments spanning classification, regression, generative modeling, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Empirical experiments show forgetting exists across diverse learning settings and significantly impacts learning efficiency.

Conclusion: This theory provides insights into forgetting and its role in learning, paving the way to improve information retention in general learning algorithms.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their
tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this
problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades
of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the
underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic
theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a
learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a
loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure
of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a
comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,
generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate
how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant
role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a
principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and
improving the information retention capabilities of general learning
algorithms.

*Mingliang Hou,Yinuo Wang,Teng Guo,Zitao Liu,Wenzhou Dou,Jiaqi Zheng,Renqiang Luo,Mi Tian,Weiqi Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for effective data removal mechanisms in cognitive diagnosis (CD) models, introducing the "Hierarchical Importance-guided Forgetting" (HIF) method to balance privacy and model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of user demands for the "right to be forgotten" conflicts with existing CD models' lack of privacy considerations, necessitating tailored solutions for data unlearning.

Method: The proposed method, HIF, uses a smoothing mechanism leveraging individual and layer-level parameter importance to efficiently erase specific data while maintaining model performance.

Result: Experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate HIF's superior performance over existing baselines in fulfilling data unlearning requests while preserving efficiency and model utility.

Conclusion: HIF provides a pioneering solution for integrating data removal with high utility in CD models, enabling privacy-preserving AI systems.

Abstract: The need to remove specific student data from cognitive diagnosis (CD) models
has become a pressing requirement, driven by users' growing assertion of their
"right to be forgotten". However, existing CD models are largely designed
without privacy considerations and lack effective data unlearning mechanisms.
Directly applying general purpose unlearning algorithms is suboptimal, as they
struggle to balance unlearning completeness, model utility, and efficiency when
confronted with the unique heterogeneous structure of CD models. To address
this, our paper presents the first systematic study of the data unlearning
problem for CD models, proposing a novel and efficient algorithm: hierarchical
importanceguided forgetting (HIF). Our key insight is that parameter importance
in CD models exhibits distinct layer wise characteristics. HIF leverages this
via an innovative smoothing mechanism that combines individual and layer, level
importance, enabling a more precise distinction of parameters associated with
the data to be unlearned. Experiments on three real world datasets show that
HIF significantly outperforms baselines on key metrics, offering the first
effective solution for CD models to respond to user data removal requests and
for deploying high-performance, privacy preserving AI systems

*Xu Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PETRA, a model leveraging evolutionary trajectories to predict SARS-CoV-2 mutations, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SARS-CoV-2's rapid and unpredictable evolution challenges public health and vaccine development, necessitating better mutation prediction methods.

Method: PETRA uses evolutionary phylogenetic trees instead of raw RNA sequences, coupled with a weighted training framework to handle imbalanced data.

Result: PETRA significantly outperformed baselines in mutation prediction, especially for nucleotide and spike amino-acid mutations.

Conclusion: PETRA is effective for real-time SARS-CoV-2 mutation prediction, addressing sequencing noise and data imbalance issues.

Abstract: Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra

*Yuxiao Wang,Di Wu,Feng Liu,Zhimin Qiu,Chenrui Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a composable fine-tuning method combining graph structural priors and modular adapters for efficient multi-task adaptation in pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational cost and instability in adapting large-scale pre-trained models to multiple tasks while improving efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Integrates graph structural priors represented by a relation matrix with modular adapters through a low-rank mapping and pluggable mechanism for efficient cross-task composition.

Result: Tests prove improved task prediction accuracy, adapter weight allocation, computational efficiency, and consistency under structural constraints.

Conclusion: The framework enhances multi-task adaptability in lightweight models by leveraging graph priors and modular mechanisms effectively in composable fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a composable fine-tuning method that integrates graph
structural priors with modular adapters to address the high computational cost
and structural instability faced by large-scale pre-trained models in
multi-task adaptation. The method introduces a relation matrix to model
dependencies among tasks, explicitly encoding correlations between nodes and
paths into graph structural priors, which provide unified structural
constraints for adapter weight allocation and path selection. Modular adapters
are embedded into different layers through low-rank mapping and a pluggable
mechanism, enabling efficient cross-task composition and reuse under prior
guidance. This mechanism not only improves parameter efficiency and training
stability but also alleviates path conflicts and redundant computation in
multi-task scenarios. Furthermore, experiments on hyperparameter sensitivity,
environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity are conducted to systematically
analyze key factors such as routing temperature, gating thresholds, and
relation matrix regularization strength, verifying the consistency and superior
performance of the method under structural constraints. The results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances task prediction accuracy,
adapter weight allocation precision, and overall computational efficiency while
maintaining model lightweight design, highlighting the synergistic advantages
of graph priors and modular mechanisms in composable fine-tuning.

*Michael Menezes,Barbara Su,Xinze Feng,Yehya Farhat,Hamza Shili,Anastasios Kyrillidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TwIST is a distributed training framework aimed at achieving efficient sparsification of large language models (LLMs) with competitive perplexity results and practical deployment advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparsification methods for large language models often require computationally expensive post-training procedures, making practical deployment cumbersome.

Method: TwIST trains multiple subnetworks simultaneously, aggregates their parameters periodically, and resamples new subnetworks, enabling high-quality sparsification during the training process.

Result: Under aggressive sparsity settings (50%+), TwIST significantly surpasses baseline methods, achieving perplexity scores as low as 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64 PPL by prior methods. It produces structured, dense matrices suitable for commodity hardware while reducing memory and inference costs.

Conclusion: TwIST provides an efficient, training-time sparsification solution for large language models, allowing zero-cost pruning at deployment and practical usability without needing additional fine-tuning or recovery steps.

Abstract: We introduce TwIST, a distributed training framework for efficient large
language model (LLM) sparsification. TwIST trains multiple subnetworks in
parallel, periodically aggregates their parameters, and resamples new
subnetworks during training. This process identifies high-quality subnetworks
("golden tickets") without requiring post-training procedures such as
calibration or Hessian-based recovery. As a result, TwIST enables zero-cost
pruning at deployment time while achieving perplexity competitive with
state-of-the-art post-training sparsification methods. The benefits are most
pronounced under aggressive sparsity (e.g., 50%+), where TwIST significantly
outperforms baseline methods; for example, reaching 23.14 PPL compared to 31.64
for the closest prior approach. Unlike unstructured pruning, TwIST produces
structured, dense matrices that offer practical inference speedups and memory
reductions on commodity hardware (e.g., CPUs) that do not support efficient
sparse computation. TwIST provides an efficient training-time path to
deployable sparse LLMs without additional fine-tuning or recovery overhead.

*Ahmed A. Metwally,Heyjun Park,Yue Wu,Tracey McLaughlin,Michael P. Snyder*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and machine learning to identify personalized metabolic subtypes and strategies for precision diabetes prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for classifying diabetes and prediabetes oversimplify underlying metabolic issues, ignoring the nuanced roles of insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency.

Method: The research uses dynamic metabolic data from CGM, machine learning models to analyze oral glucose tolerance tests, and wearable technology to study lifestyle impacts on metabolic dysfunction.

Result: Evidence suggests that CGM provides actionable metabolic subphenotypes, with individual postprandial glycemic responses serving as biomarkers for precise interventions.

Conclusion: This approach enables tailored nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies for diabetes prevention and management via precision medicine.

Abstract: The classification of diabetes and prediabetes by static glucose thresholds
obscures the pathophysiological dysglycemia heterogeneity, primarily driven by
insulin resistance (IR), beta-cell dysfunction, and incretin deficiency. This
review demonstrates that continuous glucose monitoring and wearable
technologies enable a paradigm shift towards non-invasive, dynamic metabolic
phenotyping. We show evidence that machine learning models can leverage
high-resolution glucose data from at-home, CGM-enabled oral glucose tolerance
tests to accurately predict gold-standard measures of muscle IR and beta-cell
function. This personalized characterization extends to real-world nutrition,
where an individual's unique postprandial glycemic response (PPGR) to
standardized meals, such as the relative glucose spike to potatoes versus
grapes, could serve as a biomarker for their metabolic subtype. Moreover,
integrating wearable data reveals that habitual diet, sleep, and physical
activity patterns, particularly their timing, are uniquely associated with
specific metabolic dysfunctions, informing precision lifestyle interventions.
The efficacy of dietary mitigators in attenuating PPGR is also shown to be
phenotype-dependent. Collectively, this evidence demonstrates that CGM can
deconstruct the complexity of early dysglycemia into distinct, actionable
subphenotypes. This approach moves beyond simple glycemic control, paving the
way for targeted nutritional, behavioral, and pharmacological strategies
tailored to an individual's core metabolic defects, thereby paving the way for
a new era of precision diabetes prevention.

*Mingyu Sung,Vikas Palakonda,Suhwan Im,Sunghwan Moon,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an autoregressive-aware split computing framework to enable deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained IoT devices while addressing memory and latency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the impracticality of deploying large language models on resource-constrained IoT devices due to challenges like large parameter sizes and memory-intensive decoding.

Method: They propose a framework with three innovations: one-point split compression (OPSC) for mixed-precision quantization, a two-stage intermediate compression pipeline (TS and TAB-Q), and a unified optimization framework for optimal split point selection, quantization, and sequence length configuration.

Result: The framework outperformed existing quantization methods by achieving a 1.49 inference speedup, reduced communication overhead, and equal or better accuracy across diverse models and hardware platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances memory usage, latency, and accuracy, making LLMs more feasible for deployment on IoT devices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
quantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework
achieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead
reduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DartQuant, a method for efficient rotational calibration during model quantization, reducing computational costs and overfitting risk, and achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization is essential for speeding up inference of large models, but current methods face computational inefficiency and overfitting issues.

Method: The paper presents DartQuant, which uses distribution-aware rotational calibration with constrained distributions to reduce computational complexity and overfitting. Additionally, it proposes QR-Orth optimization for efficient computation.

Result: DartQuant achieves 47x speedup and 10x memory savings in rotational optimization for a 70B model, and enables rotational calibration on a 70B model using a single 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: DartQuant makes large-scale model quantization feasible in resource-constrained environments while improving optimization efficiency and reducing overfitting, marking a significant step in model quantization advancements.

Abstract: Quantization plays a crucial role in accelerating the inference of
large-scale models, and rotational matrices have been shown to effectively
improve quantization performance by smoothing outliers. However, end-to-end
fine-tuning of rotational optimization algorithms incurs high computational
costs and is prone to overfitting. To address this challenge, we propose an
efficient distribution-aware rotational calibration method, DartQuant, which
reduces the complexity of rotational optimization by constraining the
distribution of the activations after rotation. This approach also effectively
reduces reliance on task-specific losses, thereby mitigating the risk of
overfitting. Additionally, we introduce the QR-Orth optimization scheme, which
replaces expensive alternating optimization with a more efficient solution. In
a variety of model quantization experiments, DartQuant demonstrates superior
performance. Compared to existing methods, it achieves 47$\times$ acceleration
and 10$\times$ memory savings for rotational optimization on a 70B model.
Furthermore, it is the first to successfully complete rotational calibration
for a 70B model on a single 3090 GPU, making quantization of large language
models feasible in resource-constrained environments. Code is available at

Conclusion: A fine-tuned ResNet model can serve as an effective tool for automated appendicitis detection from pediatric ultrasound images, showcasing potential for assisting clinicians in challenging diagnostic scenarios.

Abstract: Pediatric appendicitis remains one of the most common causes of acute
abdominal pain in children, and its diagnosis continues to challenge clinicians
due to overlapping symptoms and variable imaging quality. This study aims to
develop and evaluate a deep learning model based on a pretrained ResNet
architecture for automated detection of appendicitis from ultrasound images. We
used the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset, which includes ultrasound
scans, laboratory data, and clinical scores from pediatric patients admitted
with abdominal pain to Children Hospital. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Each
subject had 1 to 15 ultrasound views covering the right lower quadrant,
appendix, lymph nodes, and related structures. For the image based
classification task, ResNet was fine tuned to distinguish appendicitis from
non-appendicitis cases. Images were preprocessed by normalization, resizing,
and augmentation to enhance generalization. The proposed ResNet model achieved
an overall accuracy of 93.44, precision of 91.53, and recall of 89.8,
demonstrating strong performance in identifying appendicitis across

TL;DR: The paper proposes the use of an automated deep learning framework, nnU-Net, for accurately segmenting the left atrium from cardiac MRI, achieving high Dice score performance and robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting the left atrium from cardiac MRI is crucial for atrial fibrillation ablation and biophysical cardiac model construction, but manual segmentation is inefficient and inconsistent.

Method: The paper utilizes the nnU-Net framework, an automated deep learning architecture, to adaptively train and evaluate segmentation performance using the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013 dataset.

Result: Using the nnU-Net model, the study achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 93.5, demonstrating accuracy and robustness compared to expert segmentations and traditional segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The nnU-Net framework effectively segments the left atrium with high accuracy and adaptability, offering enhanced performance and practicality for clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from cardiac MRI is critical
for guiding atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and constructing biophysical
cardiac models. Manual delineation is time-consuming, observer-dependent, and
impractical for large-scale or time-sensitive clinical workflows. Deep learning
methods, particularly convolutional architectures, have recently demonstrated
superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks. In this study, we
applied the nnU-Net framework, an automated, self-configuring deep learning
segmentation architecture, to the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge 2013
dataset. The dataset consists of thirty MRI scans with corresponding
expert-annotated masks. The nnU-Net model automatically adapted its
preprocessing, network configuration, and training pipeline to the
characteristics of the MRI data. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated
using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and qualitative results were
compared against expert segmentations. The proposed nnUNet model achieved a
mean Dice score of 93.5, demonstrating high overlap with expert annotations and
outperforming several traditional segmentation approaches reported in previous
studies. The network exhibited robust generalization across variations in left
atrial shape, contrast, and image quality, accurately delineating both the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of controlling and optimizing image generation in diffusion models without costly retraining.

Method: The study compares the evolutionary optimization method Sep-CMA-ES with Adam, using a weighted fitness function integrating LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 and CLIPScore on Stable Diffusion XL Turbo’s prompt embedding vector.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Sep-CMA-ES consistently outperforms Adam in improving both aesthetic quality and alignment with prompts in images.

Conclusion: Evolutionary optimization methods like Sep-CMA-ES provide an efficient, gradient-free way to enhance diffusion model controllability, offering significant potential for future research on embedding space exploration.

Abstract: Deep generative models, especially diffusion architectures, have transformed
image generation; however, they are challenging to control and optimize for
specific goals without expensive retraining. Embedding Space Exploration,
especially with Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), has been shown to be a promising
method for optimizing image generation, particularly within Diffusion Models.
Therefore, in this work, we study the performance of an evolutionary
optimization method, namely Separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (sep-CMA-ES), against the widely adopted Adaptive Moment Estimation
(Adam), applied to Stable Diffusion XL Turbo's prompt embedding vector. The
evaluation of images combines the LAION Aesthetic Predictor V2 with CLIPScore
into a weighted fitness function, allowing flexible trade-offs between visual
appeal and adherence to prompts. Experiments on a subset of the Parti Prompts
(P2) dataset showcase that sep-CMA-ES consistently yields superior improvements
in aesthetic and alignment metrics in comparison to Adam. Results indicate that
the evolutionary method provides efficient, gradient-free optimization for
diffusion models, enhancing controllability without the need for fine-tuning.
This study emphasizes the potential of evolutionary methods for embedding space
exploration of deep generative models and outlines future research directions.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores the adaptation of modern Hopfield networks for biological plausibility, focusing on memory retention via ensembles and slot-based storage akin to AI language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate biologically plausible mechanisms that mimic slot-based computation for memory and language models, bridging the gap between neuroscience and AI capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces the K-winner MHN, which uses overlapping sparse neuron ensembles for memory retention, and extends MHN to emulate slot-based computation in language models through adaptation of memory and encoding storage.

Result: The ensemble-based MHN exhibits improved memory retention under continual learning, and the adapted approach captures functional outcomes of slot-based memory in language models.

Conclusion: The extensions to modern Hopfield networks offer insights into biologically plausible mechanisms for memory and computation, advancing understanding of human-like abilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Many models used in artificial intelligence and cognitive science rely on
multi-element patterns stored in "slots" - dedicated storage locations - in a
digital computer. As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they
might achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the
neurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which
stores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose
extensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model
of memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in
contemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that
the weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated
individual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN,
extending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning
regime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as
measured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron)
MHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary
language models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs
and their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error
signals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the
learned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we
show how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional
outcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards
understanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations
that have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior
models have been able to achieve.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper extends the treatment of abstract syntax with binding for languages with second-class sorts using actegories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handle abstract syntax for programming languages like CBV and CBPV involving second-class sorts.

Method: Adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's framework, transitioning from monoids in categories to actions in actegories for second-class sorts.

Result: The adapted theory successfully proves substitution lemmata for Call-by-Value variants.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical understanding of abstract syntax in the context of programming calculi involving second-class sorts.

Abstract: We adapt Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi's treatment of abstract syntax with
binding, substitution, and holes to account for languages with second-class
sorts. These situations include programming calculi such as the Call-by-Value
lambda-calculus (CBV) and Levy's Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV). Prohibiting
second-class sorts from appearing in variable contexts changes the
characterisation of the abstract syntax from monoids in monoidal categories to
actions in actegories. We reproduce much of the development through
bicategorical arguments. We apply the resulting theory by proving substitution
lemmata for varieties of CBV.

### [159] [Dynamic Shape Control of Soft Robots Enabled by Data-Driven Model Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03931)
*Iman Adibnazari,Harsh Sharma,Myungsun Park,Jacobo Cervera-Torralba,Boris Kramer,Michael T. Tolley*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper studies dynamic shape control for soft robots, using model reduction techniques to develop linear models and evaluates them with model predictive control in simulated experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective dynamic shape control of soft robots requires accounting for their high-dimensional dynamics, but there is a lack of tools for modeling them effectively.

Method: The authors conducted comparative analysis of three data-driven model reduction techniques: eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf). They tested these models in three experiments using an eel-inspired soft robot.

Result: The LOpInf-based policies performed better by generating lower tracking errors than other model-based policies in all experiments.

Conclusion: LOpInf offers a promising method for improving dynamic shape control in soft robots, demonstrating strong performance compared to other methods.

Abstract: Soft robots have shown immense promise in settings where they can leverage
dynamic control of their entire bodies. However, effective dynamic shape
control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional
dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for
modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating
linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three
methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with
control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each
class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies
for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three
experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be
feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model
of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a
reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies
generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.

*Yushi Wang,Changsheng Luo,Penghui Chen,Jianran Liu,Weijian Sun,Tong Guo,Kechang Yang,Biao Hu,Yangang Zhang,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This work develops a reinforcement learning-based controller designed for humanoid robots in soccer, integrating visual perception and motion control for reactive and coherent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid soccer systems face challenges due to decoupled modules causing delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, alongside perceptual limitations.

Method: The paper introduces a unified reinforcement learning-based controller incorporating an encoder-decoder architecture with a virtual perception system to model real-world visual dynamics, enabling integration of perception and action.

Result: The controller performs robustly, demonstrating coherent and reactive soccer behaviors in varied scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

Conclusion: The unified controller effectively addresses dynamic challenges in humanoid soccer by integrating perception and motion control, achieving strong real-world performance.

Abstract: Humanoid soccer poses a representative challenge for embodied intelligence,
requiring robots to operate within a tightly coupled perception-action loop.
However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in
delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while
real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this
work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables
humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct
integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends
Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic
environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control.
We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception
system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to
recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active
coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller
demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust
soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.

*Chenzui Li,Yiming Chen,Xi Wu,Giacinto Barresi,Fei Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to optimize human posture in bimanual human-robot tasks, improving ergonomics and force manipulability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in prioritizing both human safety and manipulative efficiency during human-robot collaboration tasks.

Method: The joint angles of a human skeleton model are optimized, and robot end-effector poses are recalibrated using a bimanual model predictive impedance controller.

Result: Experiments show improved muscle conditions and enhanced safety and manipulative capability across various tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully improves physical ergonomics and human-robot task efficiency, validated across diverse collaboration scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
(e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
before and after optimization.

### [162] [An LLM-based Framework for Human-Swarm Teaming Cognition in Disaster Search and Rescue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04042)
*Kailun Ji,Xiaoyu Hu,Xinyu Zhang,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-based system to optimize human-UAV swarm collaboration during disaster SAR operations, emphasizing ease of task execution, reduced cognitive burden, and enhanced results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaster SAR operations face challenges with complex terrains, disrupted communications, and the difficulty of translating goals into actionable commands under pressure.

Method: The study introduces an LLM-CRF system where LLMs interpret operator intentions via voice or graphical interactions, perform task decomposition, and enable real-time feedback in a closed-loop framework.

Result: In simulated SAR scenarios, the LLM-driven system decreased task completion time by 64.2%, improved success rate by 7%, and reduced cognitive workload by 42.9%.

Conclusion: LLMs significantly improve the efficiency and intuitiveness of human-swarm collaborations, showing potential for high-stakes SAR operations.

Abstract: Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
$7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores high-performance fault-tolerant computing systems for autonomous operations in planetary exploration, showcasing major speedup in algorithm performance and introducing a fault detection mechanism (ARBITER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for onboard high-performance and fault-tolerant systems in upcoming planetary exploration missions, enabling safe and autonomous operations like guidance and navigation during mission-critical phases such as Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).

Method: The study assessed the performance of GNC and LVS algorithms on advanced processors (HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, AMD Xilinx Versal), while proposing ARBITER, a real-time fault detection and correction mechanism. Fault injection studies and experiments validated this approach.

Result: The LVS image processing showed a 15x performance increase, while GFOLD trajectory optimization saw a 250x improvement. ARBITER successfully managed fault detection and correction in both static and dynamic computational environments. Sensitive stages to errors were pinpointed, suggesting mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a robust architectural solution for planetary exploration missions with improved computational reliability, autonomy, energy efficiency, and fault resilience, addressing requirements for future missions like Mars Sample Return and Enceladus Orbilander.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration missions demand high-performance, fault-tolerant
computing to enable autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) and
Lander Vision System (LVS) operations during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL).
This paper evaluates the deployment of GNC and LVS algorithms on
next-generation multi-core processors--HPSC, Snapdragon VOXL2, and AMD Xilinx
Versal--demonstrating up to 15x speedup for LVS image processing and over 250x
speedup for Guidance for Fuel-Optimal Large Divert (GFOLD) trajectory
optimization compared to legacy spaceflight hardware. To ensure computational
reliability, we present ARBITER (Asynchronous Redundant Behavior Inspection for
Trusted Execution and Recovery), a Multi-Core Voting (MV) mechanism that
performs real-time fault detection and correction across redundant cores.
ARBITER is validated in both static optimization tasks (GFOLD) and dynamic
closed-loop control (Attitude Control System). A fault injection study further
identifies the gradient computation stage in GFOLD as the most sensitive to
bit-level errors, motivating selective protection strategies and vector-based
output arbitration. This work establishes a scalable and energy-efficient
architecture for future missions, including Mars Sample Return, Enceladus
Orbilander, and Ceres Sample Return, where onboard autonomy, low latency, and
fault resilience are critical.

*Yanbo Pang,Qingkai Li,Mingguo Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a biomimetic Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based control framework mimicking the human Central Nervous System for enhancing manipulation agility in robotic arms in dynamic and complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing control algorithms for robotic arms struggle with achieving agile and adaptable manipulation in healthcare, service, and daily life applications.

Method: The framework leverages five biomimetic SNN modules (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord) with three hierarchical control levels and two information pathways.

Result: The control framework was validated in simulations and real-world tests on robotic arms, demonstrating improved manipulation agility compared to industrial-grade position control.

Conclusion: The proposed biomimetic control approach using SNNs is effective in achieving agile and adaptable robotic arm manipulation in complex environments.

Abstract: As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into
healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to
achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic
trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper
presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),
inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in
such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules
(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three
hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two
information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented
using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module
employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust
spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module
similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a
recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing
feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in
simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and
trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BFM-Zero is a framework for humanoid robots that creates a shared latent representation of motions, goals, and rewards, enabling versatile and robust robot control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to humanoid robot control either focus on simulation or task-specific methods, lacking a unified solution for diverse tasks. The desire to create a promptable generalist policy inspired the study.

Method: The method relies on unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward models to build a shared latent space. It incorporates critical enhancements such as reward shaping, domain randomization, and asymmetric learning to adapt from simulation to real-world scenarios.

Result: BFM-Zero enabled a Unitree G1 humanoid robot to perform versatile and robust skills in the real world using various inference methods including motion tracking, goal-reaching, and reward optimization.

Conclusion: BFM-Zero represents a significant step towards scalable, generalist control models for humanoids, showing promise in unifying diverse tasks under a single framework.

Abstract: Building Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) for humanoid robots has the
potential to unify diverse control tasks under a single, promptable generalist
policy. However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on
simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as
tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared
latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common
space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks
without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables
versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real
world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal
reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation.
Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds
upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models,
which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation
of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping,
domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the
sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in
simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward
scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid
control.

*Yizhen Yin,Dapeng Feng,Hongbo Chen,Yuhua Qi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid Active SLAM framework that improves exploration speed and path optimization while ensuring efficiency and practical application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active SLAM methodologies often suffer from slow exploration and inefficient or suboptimal paths, hindering real-world usability.

Method: The authors introduce a hybrid framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning framework with a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism designed to balance travel distance and map uncertainty while curbing redundant exploration.

Result: Through experiments, the method showed reduced exploration time by up to 65%, reduced path distances by 42%, improved exploration efficiency, and ensured map completeness. It also demonstrated effective training convergence and adaptability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of previous Active SLAM methods by optimizing exploration and path efficiency, proving to be both effective in simulations and applicable in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
environments.

*Shenglin Wang,Mingtong Dai,Jingxuan Su,Lingbo Liu,Chunjie Chen,Xinyu Wu,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GraspView is an RGB-only robotic grasping system designed for cluttered environments without depth sensors, significantly outperforming RGB-D and single-view RGB systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is improving robotic grasping in cluttered environments where conventional RGB-D systems fail, especially due to occlusion, poor perception, or glossy/transparent objects.

Method: GraspView integrates scene reconstruction, active perception, and online metric alignment to reliably perform global grasping using RGB cameras.

Result: Experiments show GraspView achieves superior performance in robotic grasping under occlusion, near-field sensing, and transparent object scenarios compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: GraspView offers a practical solution to robotic grasping challenges in unstructured environments, proving versatile and reliable without dependence on depth sensors.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation, yet
remains highly challenging in cluttered environments where occlusion, poor
perception quality, and inconsistent 3D reconstructions often lead to unstable
or failed grasps. Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to
provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and
degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping
pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without
depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global
perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale
geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a
coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy,
which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii)
an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against
robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these
tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing
multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution.
Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView
significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially
under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These
results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D
pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.

*Marco Iannotta,Yuxuan Yang,Johannes A. Stork,Erik Schaffernicht,Todor Stoyanov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses sim-to-real transfer challenges in RL for robotics, introducing a context-aware approach integrated into Domain Randomization (DR) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sim-to-real transfer struggles due to discrepancies between simulated and real-world dynamics. The paper aims to enhance RL systems by conditioning policies on dynamics parameters, improving generalization.

Method: The research proposes a DR-based reinforcement learning framework with a context estimation module and compares supervision strategies systematically.

Result: Context-aware policies outperformed context-agnostic baselines across benchmarks, although task-dependent variations in supervision strategy effectiveness were noted.

Conclusion: Incorporating context into DR significantly enhances sim-to-real transfer and policy performance, highlighting the importance of tailored strategies for different tasks.

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)
for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the
real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization
(DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized
dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While
standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we
investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the
policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To
this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework
and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the
resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a
real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that
context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all
settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.

*Jinfeng Liang,Haocheng Guo,Ximin Lyu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tailsitter VTOL UAV with a reconfigurable wing design, improved rotor configuration, and swashplateless mechanism, validated by flight tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a tailsitter UAV design that addresses wind disturbance issues, enhances power efficiency, and reduces structural weight while achieving stable flight.

Method: The design includes reconfigurable wings, a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor system, and an optimized swashplateless mechanism with flapping hinges. Transition flight tests validate the performance.

Result: The UAV achieves stable flight performance across its entire flight envelope, reduces power consumption, and minimizes structural weight.

Conclusion: The proposed design demonstrates improved aerodynamic stability, optimized power efficiency, and structural simplicity, making it suitable for efficient VTOL operations.

Abstract: The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MacroNav introduces an efficient learning-based framework for autonomous navigation in unknown environments, improving success rates and path efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of autonomous navigation in partially observable and unknown environments, seeking balanced spatial representation and navigation efficiency.

Method: MacroNav employs a lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning for spatial representations, combined with a reinforcement learning policy that integrates graph-based reasoning for decision-making.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved environmental understanding, superior navigation performance, and real-world validation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in Success Rate and Success weighted by Path Length.

Conclusion: MacroNav's approach proves effective and computationally efficient, offering a robust solution for autonomous navigation with promising real-world applicability.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unknown environments requires compact yet expressive
spatial understanding under partial observability to support high-level
decision making. Existing approaches struggle to balance rich contextual
representation with navigation efficiency. We present MacroNav, a
learning-based navigation framework featuring two key components: (1) a
lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to
capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a
reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations
with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust
environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's
effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation
methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL),
while maintaining low computational cost. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

*Maëlic Neau,Zoe Falomir,Paulo E. Santos,Anne-Gwenn Bosser,Cédric Buche*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces GraSP-VLA, a neuro-symbolic framework combining symbolic and VLA models to learn tasks from human demonstrations and apply scalable long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern autonomous robots face challenges in learning new skills from demonstrations. Available approaches either lack high-level symbolic planning in vision-language models or struggle with scalability in symbolic action models.

Method: GraSP-VLA uses a Continuous Scene Graph to create symbolic representations of human demonstrations, enabling dynamic planning and coordination of low-level VLA policies for complex sequences of actions.

Result: Experiments show GraSP-VLA effectively generates planning domains from observations and scales the reproduction of actions in long-horizon tasks using its scene graph representation.

Conclusion: GraSP-VLA bridges gaps between symbolic planning and vision-language policies, enabling scalable, long-horizon autonomous task learning and execution.

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is
an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply
end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or
symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current
VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which
hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic
approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this
paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that
uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic
representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate
new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for
low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced
in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic
representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from
observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential
of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA
policies in long-horizon tasks.

*Anna Mészáros,Javier Alonso-Mora,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores how to best represent joint distributions of agents in autonomous scenes and finds that explicit modeling of interactions yields better prediction accuracy than implicit learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the prediction accuracy of scene evolution to enhance decision-making for autonomous vehicles by better representing interactions between agents.

Method: The paper examines different methods of describing interactions within a network structure and evaluates their impact on learned joint distributions.

Result: Explicitly representing interactions (e.g., defining agent pair behaviors) significantly improves performance compared to allowing implicit learning of agent interactions.

Conclusion: Explicit interaction modeling, such as using spatial and temporal human-based relations, offers a clear performance advantage over implicit learning methods.

Abstract: Effectively capturing the joint distribution of all agents in a scene is
relevant for predicting the true evolution of the scene and in turn providing
more accurate information to the decision processes of autonomous vehicles.
While new models have been developed for this purpose in recent years, it
remains unclear how to best represent the joint distributions particularly from
the perspective of the interactions between agents. Thus far there is no clear
consensus on how best to represent interactions between agents; whether they
should be learned implicitly from data by neural networks, or explicitly
modeled using the spatial and temporal relations that are more grounded in
human decision-making. This paper aims to study various means of describing
interactions within the same network structure and their effect on the final
learned joint distributions. Our findings show that more often than not, simply
allowing a network to establish interactive connections between agents based on
data has a detrimental effect on performance. Instead, having well defined
interactions (such as which agent of an agent pair passes first at an
intersection) can often bring about a clear boost in performance.

TL;DR: ForeRobo introduces a generative approach for robotic manipulation skills using simulations to autonomously learn and act based on envisioned goal states. This involves a propose-generate-learn-actuate cycle combining simulations, state generation, and classical control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge and significance of acquiring advanced robotic manipulation skills efficiently through simulations.

Method: Propose a self-guided cycle: (1) Proposing skills, (2) Generating and configuring skill-consistent goal states using ForeGen, (3) Training ForeFormer model to predict 3D goal positions, and (4) Utilizing classical control algorithms for real-world actions.

Result: ForeFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models in simulation tasks by an average of 56.32% improvement and showcased generalization abilities across robotic tasks with an average success rate of 79.28%.

Conclusion: The proposed ForeRobo framework demonstrates strong improvement and efficacy in sim-to-real robotic manipulation tasks, showcasing interpretability and execution efficiency.

Abstract: Efficiently leveraging simulation to acquire advanced manipulation skills is
both challenging and highly significant. We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a
generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously
acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of
directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative
paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a
self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first
proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation
environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to
generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the
virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed
state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise
correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the
current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,
classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world
environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared
with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior
interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer
across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and
observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state
generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different
manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than
20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits
remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of
79.28\%.

### [174] [Temporal Action Selection for Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04421)
*Yueyang Weng,Xiaopeng Zhang,Yongjin Mu,Yingcong Zhu,Yanjie Li,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Temporal Action Selector (TAS) to improve Learning from Demonstration (LfD) by enhancing reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence through dynamic action selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current limitations in action chunking for Learning from Demonstrations include compromised reactivity due to lower decision frequency, which affects adaptation to noise and environmental changes.

Method: The proposed Temporal Action Selector (TAS) uses cached action chunks from multiple timesteps and selects the optimal action dynamically with a selector network.

Result: TAS significantly improves success rates (up to a 73.3% gain) and enhances training efficiency and performance when integrated with residual reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: TAS effectively balances reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence while improving success rates and efficacy in robot simulations and physical implementations.

Abstract: Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration
(LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,
action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert
policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of
recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the
inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.
Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off
reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),
which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically
selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves
balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision
consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with
diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -
yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a
base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances
training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both
simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Evo-1 is a lightweight Vision-Language-Action model offering strong performance without pretraining on robot data and surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks in efficiency and task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models face challenges such as high computational costs, dependency on large-scale robot data, and compromised generalization due to overfitting.

Method: Evo-1 integrates a multimodal vision-language model with an innovative cross-modulated diffusion transformer and optimized integration modules. It uses a novel two-stage training paradigm to align action with perception while preserving visual-language backbone representations.

Result: Evo-1 achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like Meta-World, RoboTwin suite, and competitive performance on LIBERO, while also excelling in real-world evaluations with a 78% success rate and low memory overhead.

Conclusion: Evo-1 showcases lightweight architecture and strong performance, making it an efficient solution for multimodal robotic tasks, with practical deployment advantages and future applicability supported by open data/code release.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that
unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse
tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically
contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data
pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as
limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training
paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language
backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.
In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces
computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong
performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native
multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated
diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together
forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training
paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the
representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,
surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also
attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations,
Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory
overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model
weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.

*Phat Nguyen,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Guy Rosman,Andrew Silva,Sertac Karaman,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a high-level framework for shared autonomy in autonomous driving, leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) to combine human input and machine planning, improving decision-making in rare and ambiguous scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems struggle in rare and ambiguous situations where humans excel due to contextual reasoning. Shared autonomy addresses these issues but existing methods fail to preserve driving intent.

Method: A unified shared autonomy framework is proposed, utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) to interpret human intent and environmental cues, integrating human input with autonomous planning strategies at a semantic level.

Result: The framework showed impressive results in both simulations (perfect recall, high accuracy/precision) and human surveys with a 92% agreement rate. It also reduced collision rates and boosted performance in the Bench2Drive benchmark.

Conclusion: Integrating human input and autonomous control through semantic and language-based representations enhances shared autonomy, enabling systems to incorporate human-like reasoning and intent effectively.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.

*Kaifeng Zhang,Shuo Sha,Hanxiao Jiang,Matthew Loper,Hyunjong Song,Guangyan Cai,Zhuo Xu,Xiaochen Hu,Changxi Zheng,Yunzhu Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a simulation-based framework for evaluating robotic manipulation policies, particularly on deformable objects. It uses real-world videos and advanced rendering techniques to achieve high simulation fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluation of robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world is costly, difficult, and less reproducible, especially in tasks involving deformable objects. Simulations could enhance scalability and reproducibility but often fall short in accurately representing soft-body interactions.

Method: The proposed framework utilizes real-world videos to create soft-body digital twins and employs 3D Gaussian Splatting for photorealistic rendering of robots, objects, and environments in simulations. It specifically examines tasks involving plush toys, ropes, and blocks.

Result: Experimental validation shows strong alignment between simulated and real-world performance for deformable object tasks. The framework uncovered behavioral patterns of learned policies effectively.

Conclusion: Physics-informed simulation combined with advanced rendering provides a reproducible, scalable, and accurate approach to evaluate robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-Diffusion, a framework leveraging human video data for robot learning. It uses a noise-based approach to address mismatched embodiment for better manipulation task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human videos offer scalable training data for robots, but direct motion transfer is infeasible due to embodiment differences between humans and robots.

Method: X-Diffusion applies noise to human actions during training, blending low-level robot-executable motions with high-level guidance from human demonstrations.

Result: Experiments show a 16% higher success rate across five manipulation tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: X-Diffusion effectively utilizes noisy human data to train robot policies, improving task performance without dynamically infeasible motions.

Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that
are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,
human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and
interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion
process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade
while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a
principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages
human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first
trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or
robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after
adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.
Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low
noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at
higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under
execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion
consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves
a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website
is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.

### [179] [GentleHumanoid: Learning Upper-body Compliance for Contact-rich Human and Object Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04679)
*Qingzhou Lu,Yao Feng,Baiyu Shi,Michael Piseno,Zhenan Bao,C. Karen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents GentleHumanoid, a framework that integrates impedance control into whole-body motion tracking for more compliant interactions in humanoid robots, tested successfully in diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning policies for humanoid robots are rigid and resist external forces, which limits their ability to naturally and safely interact with human environments. There's a need to improve physical compliance in humanoid robots for better collaboration and interaction in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors propose GentleHumanoid, a framework that uses a spring-based impedance control strategy for whole-body motion tracking to achieve upper-body compliance. The control system handles both resistive and guiding contacts and enforces kinematically consistent forces across joints. Adjustable force thresholds further enhance safety.

Result: Experiments in simulation and on the Unitree G1 robot showed effectiveness in tasks like hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and manipulation. The policy achieved smoother interactions, reduced peak forces, and maintained task success better than baselines.

Conclusion: GentleHumanoid demonstrates that integrating impedance control into motion policies can enable safer, more natural interactions between humanoid robots and humans or objects, advancing their usability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme
forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a
framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking
policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based
formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing
against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human
motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across
the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse
interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable
force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,
including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object
manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak
contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more
natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots
that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in
real-world environments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of transferring software engineering research into practice and proposes the need for statistical causal inference (SCI) when controlled experiments are not feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to ensure betterment of software producers and consumers by transferring research knowledge effectively using tools, processes, and guidelines, verified through evidence-based causal relationships.

Method: The paper highlights the importance of randomized control trials and, where not feasible, the need for statistical causal inference (SCI) using observational data.

Result: It identifies the challenges of using randomized control trials in certain scenarios and advocates for reliable SCI processes in practice.

Conclusion: Statistical causal inference can provide an alternative method for deriving causal relationships in cases where controlled experiments are not viable, ensuring scientific contributions can be effectively transferred to real-world applications.

Abstract: As any scientific discipline, the software engineering (SE) research
community strives to contribute to the betterment of the target population of
our research: software producers and consumers. We will only achieve this
betterment if we manage to transfer the knowledge acquired during research into
practice. This transferal of knowledge may come in the form of tools,
processes, and guidelines for software developers. However, the value of these
contributions hinges on the assumption that applying them causes an improvement
of the development process, user experience, or other performance metrics. Such
a promise requires evidence of causal relationships between an exposure or
intervention (i.e., the contributed tool, process or guideline) and an outcome
(i.e., performance metrics). A straight-forward approach to obtaining this
evidence is via controlled experiments in which a sample of a population is
randomly divided into a group exposed to the new tool, process, or guideline,
and a control group. However, such randomized control trials may not be
legally, ethically, or logistically feasible. In these cases, we need a
reliable process for statistical causal inference (SCI) from observational
data.

### [181] [Collaborative Agents for Automated Program Repair in Ruby](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03925)
*Nikta Akbarpour,Mahdieh Sadat Benis,Fatemeh Hendijani Fard,Ali Ouni,Mohamed Aymen Saied*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RAMP is a lightweight framework for automated program repair (APR), targeting Ruby, an often overlooked language. Using collaborative agents and test-driven feedback, it surpasses previous methods without relying on heavy databases or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ruby programmers face persistent challenges while APR research largely focuses on other languages. This paper seeks to address this gap.

Method: RAMP utilizes collaborative agents that iteratively generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine fixes in Ruby. It relies on lightweight prompting instead of extensive repair databases or fine-tuning.

Result: RAMP outperforms prior methods with a pass@1 of 67% on the XCodeEval benchmark for Ruby. It converges within five iterations, ensuring efficient program repair.

Conclusion: RAMP demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-agent repair strategies in APR, particularly for improving debugging in under-studied languages like Ruby. It opens new avenues for extending LLM-based tools.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language
Models (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and
focused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web
development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received
little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel
lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven,
iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that
generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a
correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid
reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead
operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven
feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a
pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly
within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and
self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that
RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors,
and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair
strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging
tools to under-studied languages.

TL;DR: This study examines how English proficiency in prompts affects the quality of code generated by LLMs, using systematic variations and key findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether English language proficiency in prompts affects code correctness and proficiency generated by LLMs, beyond the prompt structure.

Method: This research used the HumanEval dataset and systematically varied English proficiency levels in prompts from basic to advanced for 164 programming tasks, measuring code proficiency and correctness.

Result: The study found that LLMs default to an intermediate natural language level (B2), and higher-proficiency prompts consistently produced more correct code across all tested models.

Conclusion: Natural language proficiency in prompts is critical for controlling code generation quality, enabling developers to improve AI reliability and tailor solutions.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Foundation Model (FM)-powered tools in
software engineering, the natural language prompt has become a critical
interface between developers and Large Language Models (LLMs). While much
research has focused on prompt structure, the natural language proficiency is
an underexplored factor that can influence the quality of generated code. This
paper investigates whether the English language proficiency itself independent
of the prompting technique affects the proficiency and correctness of code
generated by LLMs. Using the HumanEval dataset, we systematically varied the
English proficiency of prompts from basic to advanced for 164 programming tasks
and measured the resulting code proficiency and correctness. Our findings show
that LLMs default to an intermediate (B2) natural language level. While the
effect on the resulting code proficiency was model-dependent, we found that
higher-proficiency prompts consistently yielded more correct code across all
models. These results demonstrate that natural language proficiency is a key
lever for controlling code generation, helping developers tailor AI output and
improve the reliability of solutions.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the complexity of generating RTL code by creating a fully automated, human-free approach that improves accuracy and functionality.

Method: The method includes creating an agentic flow with multiple specialized agents incorporating Progressive Error Feedback System (PEFA) for iterative self-correction during RTL generation.

Result: Benchmarking on open-source datasets showcases improved pass rates, token efficiency, and enhanced performance using both open- and closed-source LLMs.

Conclusion: This approach sets new standards in RTL code generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance while bridging gaps between different LLM platforms.

Abstract: We present an agentic flow consisting of multiple agents that combine
specialized LLMs and hardware simulation tools to collaboratively complete the
complex task of Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation without human
intervention. A key feature of the proposed flow is the progressive error
feedback system of agents (PEFA), a self-correcting mechanism that leverages
iterative error feedback to progressively increase the complexity of the
approach. The generated RTL includes checks for compilation, functional
correctness, and synthesizable constructs. To validate this adaptive approach
to code generation, benchmarking is performed using two opensource natural
language-to-RTL datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach
implemented on an open source agentic framework, using both open- and
closed-source LLMs, effectively bridging the performance gap between them.
Compared to previously published methods, our approach sets a new benchmark,
providing state-of-the-art pass rates while being efficient in token counts.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VulInstruct is a specification-guided method for improving vulnerability detection in code by helping LLMs focus on safe behaviors rather than data patterns, significantly outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with vulnerability detection due to a lack of understanding of security specifications, which outline safe code behavior but are often missing in training datasets.

Method: VulInstruct builds a specification knowledge base using (i) general security specifications from code patches, and (ii) domain-specific specifications from violations in repositories. This helps LLMs reason about expected behaviors by referring to historical security cases.

Result: VulInstruct improves vulnerability detection, with a 32.7% higher F1-score and 50.8% improved recall over baselines on PrimeVul. It also identified a high-severity vulnerability in production code (CVE-2025-56538).

Conclusion: VulInstruct demonstrates the importance of guiding LLMs with security specifications for effective and practical vulnerability detection. Its performance highlights its potential utility for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
understanding tasks. However, they demonstrate limited performance in
vulnerability detection and struggle to distinguish vulnerable code from
patched code. We argue that LLMs lack understanding of security specifications
-- the expectations about how code should behave to remain safe. When code
behavior differs from these expectations, it becomes a potential vulnerability.
However, such knowledge is rarely explicit in training data, leaving models
unable to reason about security flaws. We propose VulInstruct, a
specification-guided approach that systematically extracts security
specifications from historical vulnerabilities to detect new ones. VulInstruct
constructs a specification knowledge base from two perspectives: (i) General
specifications from high-quality patches across projects, capturing fundamental
safe behaviors; and (ii) Domain-specific specifications from repeated
violations in particular repositories relevant to the target code. VulInstruct
retrieves relevant past cases and specifications, enabling LLMs to reason about
expected safe behaviors rather than relying on surface patterns. We evaluate
VulInstruct under strict criteria requiring both correct predictions and valid
reasoning. On PrimeVul, VulInstruct achieves 45.0% F1-score (32.7% improvement)
and 37.7% recall (50.8% improvement) compared to baselines, while uniquely
detecting 24.3% of vulnerabilities -- 2.4x more than any baseline. In pair-wise
evaluation, VulInstruct achieves 32.3% relative improvement. VulInstruct also
discovered a previously unknown high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-56538) in
production code, demonstrating practical value for real-world vulnerability
discovery. All code and supplementary materials are available at

TL;DR: AdaTaint is an LLM-driven taint analysis framework for software vulnerability detection that reduces false positives and improves recall through neuro-symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static analysis methods struggle with incomplete specifications and false positives, necessitating an improved approach.

Method: AdaTaint combines large language model (LLM) predictions with neuro-symbolic reasoning, grounding outputs in program facts and constraints.

Result: AdaTaint reduces false positives by 43.7% on average, improves recall by 11.2%, and exhibits competitive runtime performance on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM inference with symbolic validation demonstrates a viable solution for more accurate and reliable vulnerability analysis in software systems.

Abstract: Static analysis is effective for discovering software vulnerabilities but
notoriously suffers from incomplete source--sink specifications and excessive
false positives (FPs). We present \textsc{AdaTaint}, an LLM-driven taint
analysis framework that adaptively infers source/sink specifications and
filters spurious alerts through neuro-symbolic reasoning. Unlike LLM-only
detectors, \textsc{AdaTaint} grounds model suggestions in program facts and
constraint validation, ensuring both adaptability and determinism.
  We evaluate \textsc{AdaTaint} on Juliet 1.3, SV-COMP-style C benchmarks, and
three large real-world projects. Results show that \textsc{AdaTaint} reduces
false positives by \textbf{43.7\%} on average and improves recall by
\textbf{11.2\%} compared to state-of-the-art baselines (CodeQL, Joern, and
LLM-only pipelines), while maintaining competitive runtime overhead. These
findings demonstrate that combining LLM inference with symbolic validation
offers a practical path toward more accurate and reliable static vulnerability
analysis.

TL;DR: This paper develops an advanced evaluation framework and benchmark (E2EDevBench) for assessing LLM-based autonomous software development agents, revealing limitations in current architectures and highlighting critical research areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in evaluating LLM-based autonomous agents due to simplistic benchmarks and implementation variables that hinder fair comparisons.

Method: The authors created E2EDevBench to simulate dynamic and realistic development scenarios. Additionally, they developed a hybrid evaluation framework that incorporates functional assessments and requirement verification.

Result: Their study shows that current state-of-the-art agents only fulfill approximately 50% of requirements, with success heavily relying on architectural strategies for task decomposition and collaboration.

Conclusion: The findings suggest the need for improving requirement comprehension and self-verification mechanisms, providing crucial benchmarks and frameworks for further research in autonomous software agents.

Abstract: The development of LLM-based autonomous agents for end-to-end software
development represents a significant paradigm shift in software engineering.
However, the scientific evaluation of these systems is hampered by significant
challenges, including overly simplistic benchmarks and the difficulty of
conducting fair comparisons between different agent architectures due to
confounding implementation variables. To address these limitations, we first
construct a challenging and dynamically curated E2EDevBench to simulate
realistic development scenarios. Second, we propose a hybrid evaluation
framework that combines test-case-based functional assessment with
fine-grained, LLM-based requirement verification. Using this framework, we
conduct a controlled empirical study on three representative agent
architectures implemented upon a unified foundation to isolate the impact of
workflow design. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art agents can fulfill
approximately 50\% of requirements on \bench{}, but their success is critically
dependent on the architectural strategy for task decomposition and
collaboration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the primary bottleneck
is the omission of requirements and inadequate self-verification. This work
provides the community with a more realistic benchmark, a comprehensive
evaluation framework, and crucial insights into the current capabilities and
core challenges of software development agents, guiding future research toward
enhancing requirement comprehension and planning.

*Asma Yamani,Malak Baslyman,Moataz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study evaluates how Large Language Models (LLMs) align with human judgments on responsible AI values, revealing gaps between stated and applied behavior, and calls for benchmarks and oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the alignment of LLMs with human judgments on responsible AI values in software engineering tasks.

Method: The researchers evaluated 23 LLMs across four tasks relating to responsible AI values and compared their alignments with two human groups using qualitative benchmarks.

Result: LLMs aligned more closely with AI practitioners than with the general US public, showing emphasized values like fairness and privacy, but exhibited inconsistencies between claimed and applied behavior.

Conclusion: The study underscores risks in value alignment and stresses the importance of systematic benchmarking and oversight for secure AI-assisted software development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software
engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation,
raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on
responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs' value
preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample
and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key
responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3)
resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software
requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally
align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative
sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and
accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs
claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4),
revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These
findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements
engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic
approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted
software development.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAFE, an IDE plugin that uses GPT-4o to enhance the explainability of static application security testing (SAST) tool findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static application security testing tools lack effective communication due to generic warning messages, leading to poor usability for developers.

Method: The authors developed SAFE, which integrates GPT-4o to provide detailed explanations on vulnerability causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies detected by SAST tools.

Result: The study showed that SAFE significantly aids beginner to intermediate developers in comprehending and addressing security vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: SAFE successfully improves SAST tool usability and helps users address security vulnerabilities more effectively.

Abstract: The prevalence of security vulnerabilities has prompted companies to adopt
static application security testing (SAST) tools for vulnerability detection.
Nevertheless, these tools frequently exhibit usability limitations, as their
generic warning messages do not sufficiently communicate important information
to developers, resulting in misunderstandings or oversight of critical
findings. In light of recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their text generation capabilities, our work investigates a hybrid approach
that uses LLMs to tackle the SAST explainability challenges. In this paper, we
present SAFE, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugin that leverages
GPT-4o to explain the causes, impacts, and mitigation strategies of
vulnerabilities detected by SAST tools. Our expert user study findings indicate
that the explanations generated by SAFE can significantly assist beginner to
intermediate developers in understanding and addressing security
vulnerabilities, thereby improving the overall usability of SAST tools.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper proposes an auditable method using Git for asynchronous information exchange between distributed entities, emphasizing transparency, traceability, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a scalable, auditable, and loosely-coupled solution for inter-organizational and air-gapped information exchange systems.

Method: Utilizing Git as the coordination medium alongside Kubernetes Operators and Custom Resources to design a communication model.

Result: The proposed Git-based model ensures transparency, traceability, reproducibility, and maintains autonomy between participating systems.

Conclusion: Git can extend beyond infrastructure management for effective cross-domain collaboration while offering both advantages and trade-offs compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and auditable method for asynchronous
information exchange between distributed entities using Git as the coordination
medium. The proposed approach replaces traditional APIs and message brokers
with a Git-based communication model built on the principles of Kubernetes
Operators and Custom Resources (CRs). Each participating entity, designated as
a Publisher or Consumer, interacts through a shared repository that serves as a
single source of truth, where the spec field captures the desired state and the
status field reflects the observed outcome. This pattern extends GitOps beyond
infrastructure management to support cross-domain, inter-organizational, and
air-gapped collaboration scenarios. By leveraging Git native features
(versioning, commit signing, and access control) the model ensures
transparency, traceability, and reproducibility while preserving loose coupling
and autonomy between systems. The paper discusses architectural principles,
implementation considerations, and comparisons with RESTful and broker-based
integrations, highlighting both the advantages and trade-offs of adopting Git
as a declarative communication substrate.

### [191] [A Tool for Benchmarking Large Language Models' Robustness in Assessing the Realism of Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04267)
*Jiahui Wu,Chengjie Lu,Aitor Arrieta,Shaukat Ali*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DriveRLR, a benchmark tool to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing realism in driving scenarios using mutated scenarios and textual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving systems requires realistic scenario-based testing, but assessing realism in simulated scenarios is difficult. Recent advancements in LLMs suggest their capability for this task.

Method: DriveRLR uses mutated scenario variants and textual prompts to test the robustness of LLMs in evaluating scenario realism. It was validated on DeepScenario dataset with three advanced LLMs.

Result: DriveRLR successfully identified differences in robustness across GPT-5, Llama 4 Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2.

Conclusion: DriveRLR is effective for assessing realism in driving scenarios using LLMs and holds potential for integration into simulation workflows for testing autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: In recent years, autonomous driving systems have made significant progress,
yet ensuring their safety remains a key challenge. To this end, scenario-based
testing offers a practical solution, and simulation-based methods have gained
traction due to the high cost and risk of real-world testing. However,
evaluating the realism of simulated scenarios remains difficult, creating
demand for effective assessment methods. Recent advances show that Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities, suggesting their potential in assessing scenario realism through
scenario-related textual prompts. Motivated by this, we propose DriveRLR, a
benchmark tool to assess the robustness of LLMs in evaluating the realism of
driving scenarios. DriveRLR generates mutated scenario variants, constructs
prompts, which are then used to assess a given LLM's ability and robustness in
determining the realism of driving scenarios. We validate DriveRLR on the
DeepScenario dataset using three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-5, Llama 4
Maverick, and Mistral Small 3.2. Results show that DriveRLR effectively reveals
differences in the robustness of various LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness
and practical value in scenario realism assessment. Beyond LLM robustness
evaluation, DriveRLR can serve as a practical component in applications such as
an objective function to guide scenario generation, supporting simulation-based
ADS testing workflows.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates code generation tasks where large language models (LLMs) struggle, identifying recurring weaknesses and benchmark complications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limitations of LLMs in code generation tasks to drive AI development and improve model capabilities.

Method: Analysis of popular benchmarks by identifying tasks where LLMs frequently fail, examining code solution complexity, and performing systematic task inspections.

Result: The study identified four common weaknesses of LLMs and benchmark-specific complications contributing to failures in code generation tasks.

Conclusion: Benchmark evaluations should address systemic weaknesses and challenges in LLMs to enhance their performance in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation, and the race to improve their performance has become a central
focus of AI research. Benchmarks and leaderboards are increasingly popular,
offering quantitative rankings of LLMs. However, they provide limited insight
into the tasks that LLMs consistently fail to solve - information that is
crucial for understanding current limitations and guiding the development of
more capable models. To address this gap, we examined code generation tasks
across four popular benchmarks, identifying those that major LLMs are most
likely to fail. To understand the causes of these failures, we investigated
whether the static complexity of solution code contributes to them, followed by
a systematic inspection of 114 tasks that LLMs consistently struggled with. Our
analysis revealed four recurring patterns of weaknesses in LLMs, as well as
common complications within benchmark tasks that most often lead to failure.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of the LLM assistant Cursor on software development. It finds Cursor boosts development speed temporarily but increases code complexity and static warnings, which hinder long-term velocity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate claims about productivity increases expected with LLMs, especially Cursor, and provide empirical evidence of its impacts on software engineering.

Method: Used a difference-in-differences design to compare GitHub projects adopting Cursor against matched control groups that did not adopt Cursor, assessing development velocity and software quality.

Result: Cursor adoption leads to a temporary boost in development velocity and a persistent rise in static analysis warnings and code complexity, which in turn slows down long-term velocity.

Conclusion: While Cursor initially improves software development velocity, the associated increase in code complexity and warnings creates long-term drawbacks. The study suggests careful evaluation in adopting LLM agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize
the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly
gaining momentum in their application to software development, with
practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet,
empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate
the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely
Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled
by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing
Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub
projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a
significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development
velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis
warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments
estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code
complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our
study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent
assistant designers, and researchers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EDIT-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on code editing tasks using real-world user instructions and challenging contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few existing benchmarks evaluate the capability of LLMs to edit code, especially based on real-world user instructions and interactions.

Method: The authors created EDIT-Bench, a benchmark with 545 problems spanning multiple languages and use cases. They integrated real-world code contexts and user instructions to test diverse LLMs.

Result: 40 LLMs were evaluated, showing that only 5 models scored over 60% accuracy. Performance varies significantly depending on instruction categories and contextual information.

Conclusion: EDIT-Bench highlights the difficulties LLMs face when editing real-world code. Enhancing contextual understanding is essential for improving success rates.

Abstract: Instructed code editing, where LLMs directly modify a developer's existing
code based on a user instruction, is becoming a widely used interaction mode in
AI coding assistants. However, few benchmarks directly evaluate this capability
and current datasets often rely on artificial sources. We introduce EDIT-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating LLM code editing capabilities grounded in real-world
usage, i.e., user instructions and code contexts collected in the wild.
EDIT-Bench comprises of 545 problems, multiple natural and programming
languages, and a diverse set of real-world use cases, ranging from resolving
errors to adding features. EDIT-Bench introduces context-dependent problems
that require the model to understand code context, highlighted code, and cursor
position in addition to the user instruction. We evaluate 40 diverse LLMs and
observe that EDIT-Bench is a challenging set of problems where only 5 models
score over 60%. We find that model performance varies across different
categories of user instructions. Further, we find that varying levels of
contextual information greatly affect task success rate, with performance
varying up to 11%, indicating the importance of evaluating with realistic
context.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper identifies dependency issues in microservices and proposes a novel method for achieving module independence using universal interfaces within a new platform architecture called EIGHT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve dependency propagation and diffusion issues in microservices and explore solutions for highly complex systems.

Method: Using module independence calculation and a universal interface design to ensure modules are free from interdependencies.

Result: Developed the EIGHT platform architecture, showcasing dynamic module modification within a monolithic application.

Conclusion: This novel design path suggests moving beyond traditional microservice and monolithic architectures for better handling complex systems.

Abstract: Although microservices have physically isolated modules, they have failed to
prevent the propagation and diffusion of dependencies. To trace the root cause
of the inter-module coupling, this paper, starting from the impact assessment
approach for module changes, proposes a conceptual method for calculating
module independence and utilizes this method to derive the necessary conditions
for module independence. Then, a new system design philosophy and software
engineering methodology is proposed, aimed at eliminating dependencies between
modules. A specific pattern is employed to design a set of universal
interfaces, serving as a universal boundary between modules. Subsequently, this
method is used to implement a platform architecture named EIGHT, demonstrating
that, as long as module independence is guaranteed, even a monolithic
application within a single process can dynamically load, unload, or modify any
part at runtime. Finally, the paper concludes that this architecture aims to
explore a novel path for increasingly complex systems, beyond microservice and
monolithic architectures.

### [196] [Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04047)
*Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper challenges reductionist scientific methods and proposes a new brain model with dual-level laws to study consciousness and mental-physical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To counter the reductionist view that undermines macro-level phenomena like consciousness by assuming causal closure at the micro level.

Method: The authors propose a model with dual laws—macro-level psychological laws and micro-level neural laws—to explain brain operations and interactions.

Result: The new methodology supports understanding consciousness and mental-physical phenomena through interactions of macro and micro levels.

Conclusion: Rejecting reductionist assumptions enables the study of causation involving macro-level phenomena and consciousness effectively.

Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes
that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone.
This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro
phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness
suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and
reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal
closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot
be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new
methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level
phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels.
This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not
determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects
from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach
that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction
between these two sets of laws.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of deep learning models, such as biologically implausible error propagation and challenges in incremental learning, by incorporating principles from neuroscience.

Method: The research investigates brain-inspired principles like synaptic updates and error computation from biological neural networks, analyzing their implementation into deep learning frameworks.

Result: The study identifies successful adaptations of biological mechanisms in AI systems, highlighting their potential in improving learning algorithms.

Conclusion: Advances in neuroscience provide a promising direction for enhancing deep learning, emphasizing synaptic plasticity and biologically informed error propagation as key areas for future AI development.

Abstract: Inspired by key neuroscience principles, deep learning has driven exponential
breakthroughs in developing functional models of perception and other cognitive
processes. A key to this success has been the implementation of crucial
features found in biological neural networks: neurons as units of information
transfer, non-linear activation functions that enable general function
approximation, and complex architectures vital for attentional processes.
However, standard deep learning models rely on biologically implausible error
propagation algorithms and struggle to accumulate knowledge incrementally.
While, the precise learning rule governing synaptic plasticity in biological
systems remains unknown, recent discoveries in neuroscience could fuel further
progress in AI. Here I examine successful implementations of brain-inspired
principles in deep learning, current limitations, and promising avenues
inspired by recent advances in neuroscience, including error computation,
propagation, and integration via synaptic updates in biological neural
networks.

*Subati Abulikemu,Tiago Azevedo,Michail Mamalakis,John Suckling*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a graph transformer autoencoder model that generates dense functional brain graphs in a low-dimensional latent space, separating cognitive states and enabling biologically plausible synthetic graph sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the need for a unified representation of functional brain graphs that combines topological and spectral information, which has previously been treated separately, for better understanding of brain dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a graph transformer autoencoder with latent diffusion where spectral geometry provides an inductive bias. This allows for the estimation of a low-dimensional latent geometry for functional connectivity graphs.

Result: The unsupervised latent representation meaningfully differentiated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, while neural dynamics improved performance. Furthermore, the model enabled the creation of biologically plausible synthetic dense graphs.

Conclusion: The presented model offers a geometric framework for understanding and representing functional brain connectivity. This approach highlights the utility of incorporating spectral geometry and dynamics for both state separation and generation of synthetic graphs.

Abstract: Functional brain graphs are often characterized with separate graph-theoretic
or spectral descriptors, overlooking how these properties covary and partially
overlap across brains and conditions. We anticipate that dense, weighted
functional connectivity graphs occupy a low-dimensional latent geometry along
which both topological and spectral structures display graded variations. Here,
we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense
functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent
diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide
learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised,
meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with
performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics. From the
diffusion modeled distribution, we were able to sample biologically plausible
and structurally grounded synthetic dense graphs.

*Valentin Mouton,Adrien Mélot*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generative modeling approach using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to design surface topographies that produce specific friction behaviors without requiring computational contact simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge in designing frictional interfaces due to the non-uniqueness of solutions and the high computational cost of traditional simulation-based methods.

Method: They develop a generative modeling framework using VAEs, trained on a synthetic dataset of 200 million samples derived from a parameterized contact mechanics model, to efficiently generate surface topographies corresponding to target friction laws.

Result: The proposed method generates candidate surface topographies without the need for simulations, providing insights into balancing accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the design solutions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for advancing near-real-time control over frictional behavior, offering a novel approach for the inverse design of frictional interfaces.

Abstract: Designing frictional interfaces to exhibit prescribed macroscopic behavior is
a challenging inverse problem, made difficult by the non-uniqueness of
solutions and the computational cost of contact simulations. Traditional
approaches rely on heuristic search over low-dimensional parameterizations,
which limits their applicability to more complex or nonlinear friction laws. We
introduce a generative modeling framework using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
to infer surface topographies from target friction laws. Trained on a synthetic
dataset composed of 200 million samples constructed from a parameterized
contact mechanics model, the proposed method enables efficient, simulation-free
generation of candidate topographies. We examine the potential and limitations
of generative modeling for this inverse design task, focusing on balancing
accuracy, throughput, and diversity in the generated solutions. Our results
highlight trade-offs and outline practical considerations when balancing these
objectives. This approach paves the way for near-real-time control of
frictional behavior through tailored surface topographies.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bifidelity Karhunen-Loève expansion (BF-KLE) surrogate model to improve field-valued quantity predictions under uncertainties, leveraging both low and high-fidelity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address computational challenges in accurately predicting field-valued quantities under uncertain inputs, using efficient and scalable modeling techniques.

Method: The approach integrates low-fidelity simulations for dominant trends, high-fidelity simulations for bias correction, and an active learning strategy using Gaussian processes to select new high-fidelity evaluations.

Result: The method demonstrates consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency across three cases (1D benchmark, 2D convection-diffusion, and 3D turbulent jet).

Conclusion: The BF-KLE-AL framework is accurate, computationally affordable, and outperforms traditional single-fidelity and random sampling methods for surrogate construction.

Abstract: We present a bifidelity Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion (KLE) surrogate model for
field-valued quantities of interest (QoIs) under uncertain inputs. The approach
combines the spectral efficiency of the KLE with polynomial chaos expansions
(PCEs) to preserve an explicit mapping between input uncertainties and output
fields. By coupling inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) simulations that capture
dominant response trends with a limited number of high-fidelity (HF)
simulations that correct for systematic bias, the proposed method enables
accurate and computationally affordable surrogate construction. To further
improve surrogate accuracy, we form an active learning strategy that adaptively
selects new HF evaluations based on the surrogate's generalization error,
estimated via cross-validation and modeled using Gaussian process regression.
New HF samples are then acquired by maximizing an expected improvement
criterion, targeting regions of high surrogate error. The resulting BF-KLE-AL
framework is demonstrated on three examples of increasing complexity: a
one-dimensional analytical benchmark, a two-dimensional convection-diffusion
system, and a three-dimensional turbulent round jet simulation based on
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) and enhanced delayed detached-eddy
simulations (EDDES). Across these cases, the method achieves consistent
improvements in predictive accuracy and sample efficiency relative to
single-fidelity and random-sampling approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and smoothness in sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT), addressing limitations in commonly used paths.

Method: The authors propose optimization problems for tilted paths of measures in DMT, emphasizing smooth velocity objectives, and employ numerical algorithms based on Gaussian process methods for solving PDEs.

Result: The developed numerical method demonstrates capability to achieve smoother and more efficient transport models compared to approaches using conventional paths.

Conclusion: The study suggests a novel optimization framework for enhancing DMT by leveraging dynamic control and advanced numerical methods, yielding smoother transport models.

Abstract: We bring a control perspective to the problem of identifying paths of
measures for sampling via dynamic measure transport (DMT). We highlight the
fact that commonly used paths may be poor choices for DMT and connect existing
methods for learning alternate paths to mean-field games. Based on these
connections we pose a flexible family of optimization problems for identifying
tilted paths of measures for DMT and advocate for the use of objective terms
which encourage smoothness of the corresponding velocities. We present a
numerical algorithm for solving these problems based on recent Gaussian process
methods for solution of partial differential equations and demonstrate the
ability of our method to recover more efficient and smooth transport models
compared to those which use an untilted reference path.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify and improve the understanding of bounds on random kernel matrices and their applications, providing streamlined and novel results for high-dimensional data analysis under general conditions.

Method: The study utilizes decoupling results for U-statistics and the non-commutative Khintchine inequality to derive bounds, and applies these methods specifically to high-dimensional inner-product kernel matrices and kernel regression cases.

Result: The paper provides tighter approximations for kernel matrices under general conditions, simplified proofs for existing results, novel findings for anisotropic Gaussian data, and improved lower bounds for kernel regression bias.

Conclusion: This research simplifies complex mathematical arguments and provides deeper insights into kernel matrices and regression, making the bounds and their applications more accessible to users.

Abstract: We present simple, user-friendly bounds for the expected operator norm of a
random kernel matrix under general conditions on the kernel function
$k(\cdot,\cdot)$. Our approach uses decoupling results for U-statistics and the
non-commutative Khintchine inequality to obtain upper and lower bounds
depending only on scalar statistics of the kernel function and a ``correlation
kernel'' matrix corresponding to $k(\cdot,\cdot)$. We then apply our method to
provide new, tighter approximations for inner-product kernel matrices on
general high-dimensional data, where the sample size and data dimension are
polynomially related. Our method obtains simplified proofs of existing results
that rely on the moment method and combinatorial arguments while also providing
novel approximation results for the case of anisotropic Gaussian data. Finally,
using similar techniques to our approximation result, we show a tighter lower
bound on the bias of kernel regression with anisotropic Gaussian data.

Motivation: To rigorously compare Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with its variants, including the effects of momentum and adaptive step-sizes, and understand their high-dimensional behavior in improving learning dynamics.

Method: Introduces a framework to create scaling limits for SGD-M with adaptive step-sizes, applies it to Spiked Tensor PCA and Single Index Models, and evaluates their high-dimensional behaviors.

Result: Finds that SGD-M can amplify high-dimensional effects under certain settings. Adaptive step-sized online SGD exhibits improved convergence and stability, and performs better in high-dimensional learning problems.

Conclusion: Adaptive step-sizes and certain preconditioning methods significantly improve the stability and performance of SGD in high-dimensional regimes, addressing limitations of traditional online SGD.

Abstract: We develop a high-dimensional scaling limit for Stochastic Gradient Descent
with Polyak Momentum (SGD-M) and adaptive step-sizes. This provides a framework
to rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show
that the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an
appropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the
step-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify
high-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online
SGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked
Tensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD
with an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the
high-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics
admit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of
admissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These
examples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how
early preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where
online SGD fails.

### [204] [Robust inference using density-powered Stein operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03963)
*Shinto Eguchi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the $\gamma$-Stein operator based on the $\gamma$-divergence, aiming for robust inference in unnormalized probability models, and demonstrates its effectiveness via robust score matching and Bayesian methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard inference methods for unnormalized probability models often lack robustness to outliers. This motivated the authors to propose a novel operator to address this issue systematically.

Method: The $\gamma$-Stein operator is constructed using density-power weighting from $\gamma$-divergence principles, allowing for reduced influence of outliers. Two robust methods—$\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy and $\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent—are developed based on this operator.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed methods outperform standard baselines in both robustness to outliers and statistical efficiency, tested on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential models.

Conclusion: The $\gamma$-Stein operator is a promising tool for robust inference, preserving key properties of score matching while improving robustness and efficiency in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a density-power weighted variant for the Stein operator, called
the $\gamma$-Stein operator. This is a novel class of operators derived from
the $\gamma$-divergence, designed to build robust inference methods for
unnormalized probability models. The operator's construction (weighting by the
model density raised to a positive power $\gamma$ inherently down-weights the
influence of outliers, providing a principled mechanism for robustness.
Applying this operator yields a robust generalization of score matching that
retains the crucial property of being independent of the model's normalizing
constant. We extend this framework to develop two key applications: the
$\gamma$-kernelized Stein discrepancy for robust goodness-of-fit testing, and
$\gamma$-Stein variational gradient descent for robust Bayesian posterior
approximation. Empirical results on contaminated Gaussian and quartic potential
models show our methods significantly outperform standard baselines in both
robustness and statistical efficiency.

### [205] [Online Conformal Inference with Retrospective Adjustment for Faster Adaptation to Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04275)
*Jungbin Jun,Ilsang Ohn*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for online conformal inference to achieve faster adaptation to distribution shifts using retrospective adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current online conformal prediction methods adapt slowly to distribution shifts as they update predictions only in a forward manner.

Method: The proposed method uses regression approaches with leave-one-out update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions according to the latest data distribution.

Result: The method demonstrates faster coverage recalibration and improved efficiency through extensive numerical studies on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: Retrospective adjustment significantly enhances performance in online environments, addressing issues caused by evolving data distributions.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for constructing
distribution-free prediction sets with guaranteed coverage assuming only the
exchangeability assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in
online environments where data distributions evolve over time. Several recent
approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, but, typically, they
slowly adapt to distribution shifts because they update predictions only in a
forward manner, that is, they generate a prediction for a newly observed data
point while previously computed predictions are not updated. In this paper, we
propose a novel online conformal inference method with retrospective
adjustment, which is designed to achieve faster adaptation to distributional
shifts. Our method leverages regression approaches with efficient leave-one-out
update formulas to retroactively adjust past predictions when new data arrive,
thereby aligning the entire set of predictions with the most recent data
distribution. Through extensive numerical studies performed on both synthetic
and real-world data sets, we show that the proposed approach achieves faster
coverage recalibration and improved statistical efficiency compared to existing
online conformal prediction methods.

*Giovanni Barbarino,Nicolas Gillis,Subhayan Saha*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses the robustness of minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) to noise, providing theoretical guarantees for accurate recovery under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise robustness in min-vol NMF has been a long-standing challenge despite its wide application across multiple domains.

Method: Theoretical analysis is conducted to prove noise robustness, leveraging the expanded sufficiently scattered condition for well-distributed data points.

Result: The study establishes that min-vol NMF can recover groundtruth factors even in noisy conditions if the data points meet the scattering condition.

Conclusion: Min-vol NMF is robust to noise under specific data distribution conditions, enhancing its utility in diverse applications.

Abstract: Minimum-volume nonnegative matrix factorization (min-vol NMF) has been used
successfully in many applications, such as hyperspectral imaging, chemical
kinetics, spectroscopy, topic modeling, and audio source separation. However,
its robustness to noise has been a long-standing open problem. In this paper,
we prove that min-vol NMF identifies the groundtruth factors in the presence of
noise under a condition referred to as the expanded sufficiently scattered
condition which requires the data points to be sufficiently well scattered in
the latent simplex generated by the basis vectors.

### [207] [Simultaneous Optimization of Geodesics and Fréchet Means](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04301)
*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Søren Hauberg,Steen Markvorsen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the GEORCE-FM algorithm for faster and more efficient calculation of the Fréchet mean on Riemannian and Finsler manifolds, demonstrating better accuracy and runtime than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computation of the Fréchet mean, a generalization of the Euclidean mean on Riemannian manifolds, is challenging due to the need for solving complex optimization problems. The authors aim to streamline this process and address scalability concerns for large datasets.

Method: The GEORCE-FM algorithm computes both the Fréchet mean and Riemannian distances in a local chart during each iteration, which speeds up computation. It is extended to Finsler manifolds and adapted for scalability to large datasets.

Result: GEORCE-FM achieves global convergence and local quadratic convergence theoretically, and an adaptive extension ensures convergence to the Fréchet mean in expectation. Empirically, it outperforms baseline methods in accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: The GEORCE-FM algorithm is a faster, scalable, and accurate method for computing the Fréchet mean, making it a significant advancement in the field of geometric statistics.

Abstract: A central part of geometric statistics is to compute the Fr\'echet mean. This
is a well-known intrinsic mean on a Riemannian manifold that minimizes the sum
of squared Riemannian distances from the mean point to all other data points.
The Fr\'echet mean is simple to define and generalizes the Euclidean mean, but
for most manifolds even minimizing the Riemannian distance involves solving an
optimization problem. Therefore, numerical computations of the Fr\'echet mean
require solving an embedded optimization problem in each iteration. We
introduce the GEORCE-FM algorithm to simultaneously compute the Fr\'echet mean
and Riemannian distances in each iteration in a local chart, making it faster
than previous methods. We extend the algorithm to Finsler manifolds and
introduce an adaptive extension such that GEORCE-FM scales to a large number of
data points. Theoretically, we show that GEORCE-FM has global convergence and
local quadratic convergence and prove that the adaptive extension converges in
expectation to the Fr\'echet mean. We further empirically demonstrate that
GEORCE-FM outperforms existing baseline methods to estimate the Fr\'echet mean
in terms of both accuracy and runtime.

### [208] [Online Bayesian Experimental Design for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04403)
*Sara Pérez-Vieites,Sahel Iqbal,Simo Särkkä,Dominik Baumann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework for Bayesian experimental design (BED) tailored for dynamical systems with partial observability, leveraging nested particle filters for efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BED approaches struggle with dynamical systems which involve noisy, incomplete observations and require efficient online computation, making them inadequate for many real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose new estimators for the expected information gain (EIG) and its gradient, marginalizing latent states using nested particle filters for scalable optimization in nonlinear state-space models.

Result: The framework demonstrates effectiveness and scalability when applied to realistic models like the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and a moving source location task.

Conclusion: Their approach addresses challenges such as partial observability and online computation, enabling BED to be applied in complex, real-world dynamical systems.

Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for
optimizing data collection, but existing approaches do not apply to crucial
real-world settings such as dynamical systems with partial observability, where
only noisy and incomplete observations are available. These systems are
naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the
link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus
information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) --
intractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online
algorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially
in a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving
new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent
states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our
approach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online
inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such
as the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task,
show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and
online computation.

### [209] [Riesz Regression As Direct Density Ratio Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04568)
*Masahiro Kato*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the connection between Riesz regression and direct density-ratio estimation (DRE), discussing their equivalence and mutual benefits for causal and structural parameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to bridge Riesz regression and DRE to enhance methodologies for causal and structural parameter estimation, addressing limitations and leveraging existing theoretical results.

Method: The study establishes the equivalence of Riesz regression and least-squares importance fitting (LSIF) in DRE, importing convergence-rate analyses, loss function selection techniques, and regularization methods.

Result: The equivalence allows mutual benefit: Riesz regression provides general applications, while DRE insights improve debiased machine learning contexts and broaden its scope.

Conclusion: Insights from this equivalence strengthen analytical tools in both debiased machine learning and DRE models, enhancing flexibility and theoretical applications for problems such as average treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Riesz regression has garnered attention as a tool in debiased machine
learning for causal and structural parameter estimation (Chernozhukov et al.,
2021). This study shows that Riesz regression is closely related to direct
density-ratio estimation (DRE) in important cases, including average treat-
ment effect (ATE) estimation. Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz
regression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF,
Kanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz
regression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer
estimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to
directly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including
convergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via
Bregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible
models, such as neural networks. Conversely, insights about the Riesz
representer in debiased machine learning broaden the applications of direct
density-ratio estimation methods. This paper consolidates our prior results in
Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).

*Zhuo Zhang,Xiong Xiong,Sen Zhang,Yuan Zhao,Xi Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inefficiency of traditional numerical methods for PDE-solving across parameter spaces and explores recent advancements in machine learning such as PINNs and neural operators to achieve faster and more generalized solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency of traditional numerical methods for solving parametric PDEs due to the need to repeatedly solve for varying parameters, which limits exploration of parameter spaces in science and engineering.

Method: The paper examines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (e.g., DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator) as two machine learning paradigms for solving parametric PDEs, comparing their approaches, theoretical foundations, and computational performance.

Result: Neural operators outperform traditional solvers with speedups of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times in multi-query scenarios, maintaining comparable accuracy across fields like fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and electromagnetics.

Conclusion: By providing comparative guidance, theoretical insights, and identifying challenges, the paper establishes a framework for parametric PDE solving using operator learning and highlights critical areas for future development.

Abstract: PDEs arise ubiquitously in science and engineering, where solutions depend on
parameters (physical properties, boundary conditions, geometry). Traditional
numerical methods require re-solving the PDE for each parameter, making
parameter space exploration prohibitively expensive. Recent machine learning
advances, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural
operators, have revolutionized parametric PDE solving by learning solution
operators that generalize across parameter spaces. We critically analyze two
main paradigms: (1) PINNs, which embed physical laws as soft constraints and
excel at inverse problems with sparse data, and (2) neural operators (e.g.,
DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operator), which learn mappings between
infinite-dimensional function spaces and achieve unprecedented generalization.
Through comparisons across fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, heat transfer, and
electromagnetics, we show neural operators can achieve computational speedups
of $10^3$ to $10^5$ times faster than traditional solvers for multi-query
scenarios, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We provide practical guidance
for method selection, discuss theoretical foundations (universal approximation,
convergence), and identify critical open challenges: high-dimensional
parameters, complex geometries, and out-of-distribution generalization. This
work establishes a unified framework for understanding parametric PDE solvers
via operator learning, offering a comprehensive, incrementally updated resource
for this rapidly evolving field

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper addresses RL model fitting for multi-armed bandit environments by proposing a novel convex optimization approach, outperforming benchmarks in speed while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and accessibility of RL model fitting for behavioral data, aiding scientific research on human and animal decision-making behavior.

Method: Developed a mathematical formulation of RL model fitting, analyzed theoretical convexity properties, and introduced a convex relaxation-based optimization method, evaluated using simulated environments.

Result: The proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly reduces computation time.

Conclusion: The method enhances RL model fitting efficiency and usability, backed by an open-source Python package for broader accessibility.

Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to
some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models
have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and
animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization
problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that
appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed
theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical
results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL
models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then
evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some
benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate
that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while
significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python
package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the
analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex
optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The U.S. construction industry struggles with persistent cost overruns and schedule deviations, revealing limitations in traditional deterministic approaches.

Method: The paper combines BIM with advanced AI technologies, including natural language processing for cost mapping, computer vision for progress tracking, Bayesian probabilistic updating for CPM, and deep reinforcement learning for resource leveling.

Result: Implementation on a mid-rise project achieved a 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization while finishing on time within 128 days with P50-P80 confidence.

Conclusion: Integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL improves forecasting precision, transparency, and resilience in construction management, establishing a pathway for adaptive and auditable workflows.

Abstract: Persistent cost and schedule deviations remain a major challenge in the U.S.
construction industry, revealing the limitations of deterministic CPM and
static document-based estimating. This study presents an integrated 4D/5D
digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with
natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision

deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case
implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable
gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6%
reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an
on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin
sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the impact of Hacker News (HN) exposure on GitHub star growth for open-source projects, using a reproducible system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the immediate impact of Hacker News exposure on GitHub star growth for open-source AI and LLM tools, addressing a challenge in gauging the effectiveness of news platform launches.

Method: The paper uses data from public APIs to analyze 138 repository launches from 2024-2025 while employing machine learning models like Elastic Net and Gradient Boosting to predict growth. It also conducts timing analysis for launches.

Result: Repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars in 48 hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Posting timing is a key factor, while the 'Show HN' tag shows no advantage when controlling for other factors.

Conclusion: HN exposure significantly drives GitHub repository growth, with optimal launch timing being crucial. The framework is highly reproducible, enabling extensions to other platforms and offering actionable insights for researchers and developers.

Abstract: Social news platforms have become key launch outlets for open-source
projects, especially Hacker News (HN), though quantifying their immediate
impact remains challenging. This paper presents a reproducible demonstration
system that tracks how HN exposure translates into GitHub star growth for AI
and LLM tools. Built entirely on public APIs, our pipeline analyzes 138
repository launches from 2024-2025 and reveals substantial launch effects:
repositories gain an average of 121 stars within 24 hours, 189 stars within 48
hours, and 289 stars within a week of HN exposure. Through machine learning
models (Elastic Net) and non-linear approaches (Gradient Boosting), we identify
key predictors of viral growth. Posting timing appears as key factor--launching
at optimal hours can mean hundreds of additional stars--while the "Show HN" tag
shows no statistical advantage after controlling for other factors. The
demonstration completes in under five minutes on standard hardware,
automatically collecting data, training models, and generating visualizations
through single-file scripts. This makes our findings immediately reproducible
and the framework easily be extended to other platforms, providing both
researchers and developers with actionable insights into launch dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Generative Bayesian Filtering, a simulation-based method for posterior inference in complex state-space models using deep neural networks, outperforming existing approaches in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address posterior inference challenges in nonlinear and non-Gaussian state-space models, particularly when observation or transition densities are intractable.

Method: Generative Bayesian Filtering extends Generative Bayesian Computation to dynamic settings. It uses deep neural networks for simulation-based inference and introduces the Generative-Gibbs sampler for parameter learning without explicit density evaluation.

Result: The proposed Generative Bayesian Filtering method demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing likelihood-free approaches, especially in intractable state-space model scenarios.

Conclusion: Generative Bayesian Filtering and the Generative-Gibbs sampler effectively enable posterior inference in complex and analytically intractable models, showing promise for wide applicability in hierarchical Bayesian settings.

Abstract: Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF) provides a powerful and flexible
framework for performing posterior inference in complex nonlinear and
non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach extends Generative Bayesian
Computation (GBC) to dynamic settings, enabling recursive posterior inference
using simulation-based methods powered by deep neural networks. GBF does not
require explicit density evaluations, making it particularly effective when
observation or transition distributions are analytically intractable. To
address parameter learning, we introduce the Generative-Gibbs sampler, which
bypasses explicit density evaluation by iteratively sampling each variable from
its implicit full conditional distribution. Such technique is broadly
applicable and enables inference in hierarchical Bayesian models with
intractable densities, including state-space models. We assess the performance
of the proposed methodologies through both simulated and empirical studies,
including the estimation of $\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models. Our
findings indicate that GBF significantly outperforms existing likelihood-free
approaches in accuracy and robustness when dealing with intractable state-space
models.

### [216] [Geometric Decomposition of Statistical Inference through Gradient Flow and Co-Monotonicity Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04599)
*Pawel Gajer,Jacques Ravel*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for analyzing feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data, focusing on context-dependent patterns using geometric decomposition methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard analysis methods fail to capture context-dependent variations in high-dimensional data where associations differ across subpopulations.

Method: The framework incorporates two strategies: Gradient flow decomposition using discrete Morse theory to partition samples into monotonic basins, and Co-monotonicity decomposition leveraging association structures to create Riemannian graphs for biclustering coherent regions and feature modules.

Result: Both strategies enable better interpretation and statistical power, especially in multi-modal data integration, and provide Bayesian posterior sampling for credible intervals.

Conclusion: The geometric decomposition framework addresses limitations of conventional methods by revealing complex, context-dependent feature-outcome relationships in diverse datasets.

Abstract: Understanding feature-outcome associations in high-dimensional data remains
  challenging when relationships vary across subpopulations, yet standard
  methods assuming global associations miss context-dependent patterns,
reducing
  statistical power and interpretability. We develop a geometric decomposition
  framework offering two strategies for partitioning inference problems into
  regional analyses on data-derived Riemannian graphs. Gradient flow
  decomposition uses path-monotonicity-validated discrete Morse theory to
  partition samples into basins where outcomes exhibit monotonic behavior.
  Co-monotonicity decomposition leverages association structure: vertex-level
  coefficients measuring directional concordance between outcome and features,
  or between feature pairs, define embeddings of samples into association
space.
  These embeddings induce Riemannian k-NN graphs on which biclustering
  identifies co-monotonicity cells (coherent regions) and feature modules. This
  extends naturally to multi-modal integration across multiple feature sets.
  Both strategies apply independently or jointly, with Bayesian posterior
  sampling providing credible intervals.

TL;DR: This paper introduces HACI, a web-based educational tool using haptic and audio feedback to aid visually impaired students in programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide equitable programming education opportunities for visually impaired students by addressing the lack of visual cues in the learning process.

Method: The HACI system integrates a web application for programming with an Arduino-powered glove equipped with haptic motors for tactile feedback, and it was evaluated via a pilot study with computer science undergraduates.

Result: The system improved non-visual code interaction but faced challenges with feedback consistency and lack of advanced features.

Conclusion: HACI has significant potential to enhance STEM education accessibility for visually impaired students, showcasing the value of integrating haptic and audio feedback in educational tools.

Abstract: This thesis introduces the Haptic-Audio Code Interface (HACI), an educational
tool designed to enhance programming education for visually impaired (VI)
students by integrating haptic and audio feedback to compensate for the absence
of visual cues. HACI consists of a non-resource-intensive web application
supporting JavaScript program development, execution, and debugging, connected
via a cable to an Arduino-powered glove with six integrated haptic motors to
provide physical feedback to VI programmers. Motivated by the need to provide
equitable educational opportunities in computer science, HACI aims to improve
non-visual code navigation, comprehension, summarizing, editing, and debugging
for students with visual impairments while minimizing cognitive load. This work
details HACI's design principles, technical implementation, and a preliminary
evaluation through a pilot study conducted with undergraduate Computer Science
students. Findings indicate that HACI aids in the non-visual navigation and
understanding of programming constructs, although challenges remain in refining
feedback mechanisms to ensure consistency and reliability, as well as
supplementing the current functionality with a more feature-reach and
customizable accessible learning experience which will allow visually impaired
students to fully utilize interleaved haptic and audio feedback. The study
underscores the transformative potential of haptic and audio feedback in
educational practices for the visually impaired, setting a foundation for
future research and development in accessible programming education. This
thesis contributes to the field of accessible technology by demonstrating how
tactile and auditory feedback can be effectively integrated into educational
tools, thereby broadening accessibility in STEM education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capability of large language models in promoting computational thinking through adaptive and context-sensitive scaffolding in gamified programming environments.

Method: The study implemented MazeMate in a 3D maze programming game and conducted a classroom test with 247 undergraduates, gathering feedback and performing thematic analysis of its impact.

Result: Students found MazeMate moderately helpful, especially for maze solving. It supported CT processes like decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking but faced limitations in maze design, including mismatched suggestions and fabricated solutions.

Conclusion: LLM-based scaffolding can aid CT development, but further refinement is needed to improve its efficacy and usability for design tasks in educational environments.

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) is a foundational problem-solving skill, and
gamified programming environments are a widely adopted approach to cultivating
it. While large language models (LLMs) provide on-demand programming support,
current applications rarely foster CT development. We present MazeMate, an
LLM-powered chatbot embedded in a 3D Maze programming game, designed to deliver
adaptive, context-sensitive scaffolds aligned with CT processes in maze solving
and maze design. We report on the first classroom implementation with 247
undergraduates. Students rated MazeMate as moderately helpful, with higher
perceived usefulness for maze solving than for maze design. Thematic analysis
confirmed support for CT processes such as decomposition, abstraction, and
algorithmic thinking, while also revealing limitations in supporting maze
design, including mismatched suggestions and fabricated algorithmic solutions.
These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based scaffolding to support CT
and underscore directions for design refinement to enhance MazeMate usability
in authentic classrooms.

### [219] [Protein aggregation in Huntington's disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04174)
*Guylaine Hoffner,Philippe Djian*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This study investigates the stabilization of protein aggregates in Huntington's disease and their implications for therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of bonds stabilizing protein aggregates in Huntington's disease is crucial for developing effective therapies.

Method: Analyzed protein aggregation mechanisms, namely polar-zipper hydrogen bonding and transglutaminase-catalyzed covalent bonding, in cell culture models.

Result: Cell culture models showed that hydrogen bonding plays a major role in aggregate stabilization, but covalent bonding is also likely.

Conclusion: The nature of aggregate bonds in Huntington's disease patient brains remains unknown and is a critical factor for therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function
in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is
likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation
have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent
bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of
Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but
covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of
the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with
Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the
aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would
condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.

### [220] [evomap: A Toolbox for Dynamic Mapping in Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04611)
*Maximilian Matthe*

Main category: cs.MS

TL;DR: Evomap is a Python package for dynamic mapping, extending static methods to analyze evolving relationships among objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mapping methods are limited to static representations, making it difficult to analyze how object relationships change over time.

Method: Evomap adapts static methods for dynamic analyses, integrating tools like MDS, Sammon Mapping, and t-SNE alongside utilities for preprocessing and evaluation.

Result: Evomap demonstrates a robust framework supporting dynamic mapping across disciplines, showcased with a usage example.

Conclusion: The package addresses the need for dynamic mapping capabilities, enabling deeper insights into evolving relationships among objects.

Abstract: This paper presents evomap, a Python package for dynamic mapping. Mapping
methods are widely used across disciplines to visualize relationships among
objects as spatial representations, or maps. However, most existing statistical
software supports only static mapping, which captures objects' relationships at
a single point in time and lacks tools to analyze how these relationships
evolve. evomap fills this gap by implementing the dynamic mapping framework
EvoMap, originally proposed by Matthe, Ringel, and Skiera (2023), which adapts
traditional static mapping methods for dynamic analyses. The package supports
multiple mapping techniques, including variants of Multidimensional Scaling
(MDS), Sammon Mapping, and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
It also includes utilities for data preprocessing, exploration, and result
evaluation, offering a comprehensive toolkit for dynamic mapping applications.
This paper outlines the foundations of static and dynamic mapping, describes
the architecture and functionality of evomap, and illustrates its application
through an extensive usage example.

### [221] [Secure Code Generation at Scale with Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03898)
*Arup Datta,Ahmed Aljohani,Hyunsook Do*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study evaluates the security in code generation using five instruction-tuned LLMs and assesses their performance through metrics like Repair and NetGain. Reflexion prompts improve security across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the widespread use and potential security risks in code generated by LLMs, the study aims to address how secure these models can be in automating code generation.

Method: The study employs the Instruct Prime approach, avoids contamination of prompts, and uses the Insecure Code Detector on five LLMs with zero-shot/reference baselines and reflexion prompting for security evaluation.

Result: Initial findings showed 25-33% of programs insecure at baseline, with Python performing best for secure coding and C/C# the worst. Reflexion prompting improved average model security from 70.74% to 79.43%, with diminishing returns after multiple rounds.

Conclusion: Code security in LLMs improves notably with reflexion prompting, especially in early rounds; two rounds yield significant benefits warranting further exploration in secure programming approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used to draft and refactor code,
but code that works is not necessarily secure. We evaluate secure code
generation using the Instruct Prime, which eliminated compliance-required
prompts and cue contamination, and evaluate five instruction-tuned code LLMs
using a zero-shot baseline and a three-round reflexion prompting approach.
Security is measured using the Insecure Code Detector (ICD), and results are
reported by measuring Repair, Regression, and NetGain metrics, considering the
programming language and CWE family. Our findings show that insecurity remains
common at the first round: roughly 25-33% of programs are insecure at a
zero-shot baseline (t0 ). Weak cryptography/config-dependent bugs are the
hardest to avoid while templated ones like XSS, code injection, and hard-coded
secrets are handled more reliably. Python yields the highest secure rates; C
and C# are the lowest, with Java, JS, PHP, and C++ in the middle. Reflexion
prompting improves security for all models, improving average accuracy from
70.74% at t0 to 79.43% at t3 , with the largest gains in the first round
followed by diminishing returns. The trends with Repair, Regression, and
NetGain metrics show that applying one to two rounds produces most of the
benefits. A replication package is available at

### [222] [Exploratory Analysis of Cyberattack Patterns on E-Commerce Platforms Using Statistical Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03020)
*Fatimo Adenike Adeniya*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms are more severe during holiday shopping periods. A hybrid framework using statistical models and machine learning detects and predicts these threats effectively, achieving up to 85.29% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the growing complexity and frequency of cyberattacks targeting e-commerce platforms, which undermine consumer trust and disrupt operations.

Method: The study combines statistical methods like Auto ARIMA, Mann-Whitney U tests, and ANOVA with machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) to analyze and predict cyberattack patterns using the VCDB dataset.

Result: The analysis identified recurrent spikes in cyberattacks during high-risk periods, such as Black Friday, with CatBoost achieving the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1: 0.2254, ROC AUC: 0.8247).

Conclusion: The integrated framework is effective for anticipating temporal risks and classifying breach types, providing actionable insights for allocating cybersecurity resources during critical periods.

Abstract: Cyberattacks on e-commerce platforms have grown in sophistication,
threatening consumer trust and operational continuity. This research presents a
hybrid analytical framework that integrates statistical modelling and machine
learning for detecting and forecasting cyberattack patterns in the e-commerce
domain. Using the Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, the study
applies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting and significance testing, including
a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2579981.5, p = 0.0121), which confirmed that holiday
shopping events experienced significantly more severe cyberattacks than
non-holiday periods. ANOVA was also used to examine seasonal variation in
threat severity, while ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and
CatBoost) were employed for predictive classification. Results reveal recurrent
attack spikes during high-risk periods such as Black Friday and holiday
seasons, with breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
exhibiting elevated threat indicators. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the
highest performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1 score = 0.2254, ROC AUC = 0.8247).
The framework uniquely combines seasonal forecasting with interpretable
ensemble learning, enabling temporal risk anticipation and breach-type
classification. Ethical considerations, including responsible use of sensitive
data and bias assessment, were incorporated. Despite class imbalance and
reliance on historical data, the study provides insights for proactive
cybersecurity resource allocation and outlines directions for future real-time
threat detection research.

### [223] [Scalable Domain-decomposed Monte Carlo Neutral Transport for Nuclear Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04489)
*Oskar Lappi,Huw Leggate,Yannick Marandet,Jan Åström,Keijo Heljanko,Dmitriy V. Borodin*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo (DDMC) neutral transport solver in a new open-source code, Eiron, addressing limitations in EIRENE regarding memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIRENE's lack of domain decomposition prevents simulations on large grids due to memory constraints.

Method: Development of a domain-decomposed Monte Carlo algorithm in Eiron, alongside comparisons with EIRENE's parallel algorithms using strong and weak scaling tests.

Result: DDMC outperforms other algorithms in strong scaling tests and demonstrates scalable efficiency on up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests.

Conclusion: Adopting the DDMC algorithm in EIRENE would enhance performance and allow simulations previously restricted by memory constraints.

Abstract: EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the
fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it
impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one
compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte
Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code,
Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in
Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests,
with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases.
On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids
that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also
scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency
of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a
low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this
domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable
simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.

*Angelos Alexopoulos,Agorakis Bompotas,Nikitas Rigas Kalogeropoulos,Panagiotis Kechagias,Athanasios P. Kalogeras,Christos Alexakos*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a platform that automates Digital Twin generation and deployment in manufacturing, enhancing flexibility and reconfiguration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to support modern manufacturing's need for flexibility and reconfigurability while streamlining production line design and adaptation.

Method: The paper proposes a platform that utilizes AutomationML-based factory plans to generate Digital Twins, coupled with GAI-powered simulation scenario generation and physical line reconfiguration.

Result: The platform automates key manufacturing processes, improving the efficiency and adaptability of production lines.

Conclusion: The approach enhances manufacturing dynamics by combining automated Digital Twin creation, real-time monitoring, simulations, and physical line adjustments.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing demands high flexibility and reconfigurability to adapt
to dynamic production needs. Model-based Engineering (MBE) supports rapid
production line design, but final reconfiguration requires simulations and
validation. Digital Twins (DTs) streamline this process by enabling real-time
monitoring, simulation, and reconfiguration. This paper presents a novel
platform that automates DT generation and deployment using AutomationML-based
factory plans. The platform closes the loop with a GAI-powered simulation
scenario generator and automatic physical line reconfiguration, enhancing
efficiency and adaptability in manufacturing.

### [225] [Overview and Performance Evaluation of Supervisory Controller Synthesis with Eclipse ESCET v4.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04370)
*Dennis Hendriks,Michel Reniers,Wan Fokkink,Wytse Oortwijn*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper discusses advances in a toolkit (ESCET) for creating supervisory controllers using synthesis-based engineering (SBE) and provides a detailed overview of CIF's algorithms, benchmark models, and performance evaluations, with the goal of improving synthesis of complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the design and implementation of supervisory controllers for cyber-physical systems, ensuring safety and correctness while automating the process through synthesis-based engineering (SBE).

Method: The authors focus on CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis algorithm and assess it through detailed descriptions, industrial/academic benchmark models, recent performance improvements between ESCET versions, and an exploration of multi-level synthesis.

Result: The study documents improvements in synthesis performance between different ESCET versions using the CIF benchmark models and highlights the potential benefits of multi-level synthesis, albeit noting that further optimization is required for handling complex models effectively.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates how advancements in ESCET and CIF contribute to enhanced tools for supervisory controller synthesis. While progress has been made, continued development is needed, particularly for synthesizing more complex models.

Abstract: Supervisory controllers control cyber-physical systems to ensure their
correct and safe operation. Synthesis-based engineering (SBE) is an approach to
largely automate their design and implementation. SBE combines model-based
engineering with computer-aided design, allowing engineers to focus on 'what'
the system should do (the requirements) rather than 'how' it should do it
(design and implementation). In the Eclipse Supervisory Control Engineering
Toolkit (ESCET) open-source project, a community of users, researchers, and
tool vendors jointly develop a toolkit to support the entire SBE process,
particularly through the CIF modeling language and tools. In this paper, we
first provide a description of CIF's symbolic supervisory controller synthesis
algorithm, and thereby include aspects that are often omitted in the
literature, but are of great practical relevance, such as the prevention of
runtime errors, handling different types of requirements, and supporting input
variables (to connect to external inputs). Secondly, we introduce and describe
CIF's benchmark models, a collection of 23 freely available industrial and
academic models of various sizes and complexities. Thirdly, we describe recent
improvements between ESCET versions v0.8 (December 2022) and v4.0 (June 2024)
that affect synthesis performance, evaluate them on our benchmark models, and
show the current practical synthesis performance of CIF. Fourthly, we briefly
look at multi-level synthesis, a non-monolithic synthesis approach, evaluate
its gains, and show that while it can help to further improve synthesis
performance, further performance improvements are still needed to synthesize
complex models.

### [226] [BTTDA: Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis for Brain-Computer Interfacing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04292)
*Arne Van Den Kerchove,Hakim Si-Mohammed,François Cabestaing,Marc M. Van Hulle*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel tensor-based feature extraction method that improves EEG classification accuracy for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tensor-based approaches for EEG classification lack flexibility to fully capture neural activity complexity, necessitating improved dimensionality reduction methods.

Method: The study proposes Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA), which extends Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA) by utilizing interpretable forward models and a deflation scheme to extract discriminant features iteratively.

Result: Benchmarking against ERP and MI EEG datasets showed BTTDA significantly outperforms traditional HODA in ERP decoding (ROC-AUC = 91.25%) and moderately improves MI decoding accuracy.

Conclusion: BTTDA provides an efficient, interpretable technique for EEG dimensionality reduction in BCIs, demonstrating adaptability and strong classification potential.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain
and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record
neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are
essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including
event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current
tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack
the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study
introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel
tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance
classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality
reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a
novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme
to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature
representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant
PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and
MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework.
Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the
traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art
performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and
PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52%
> 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more
efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power.
This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI
and broader neuroimaging applications.
