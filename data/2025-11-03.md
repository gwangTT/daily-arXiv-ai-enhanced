### [1] [CATArena: Evaluation of LLM Agents through Iterative Tournament Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26852)
*Lingyue Fu,Xin Ding,Yaoming Zhu,Shao Zhang,Lin Qiu,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai,Jiaxin Ding,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel evaluation framework for LLM agents called CATArena, which focuses on iterative and competitive peer-learning in dynamic, open-ended game scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on fixed scenarios, leading to score saturation and limited evaluation of learning abilities. The paper aims to address these issues by emphasizing learning ability to drive agent evolution toward human-level intelligence.

Method: The proposed method involves an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework with agents refining their strategies via repeated interactions and feedback. CATArena, a tournament-style platform with open-ended scoring board and card games, is introduced for dynamic evaluation.

Result: Experimental results show that CATArena offers reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for agent abilities, especially learning and strategy development, using both basic and commercial code agents.

Conclusion: CATArena introduces a dynamic evaluation paradigm, overcoming limitations in current benchmarks and enabling robust assessment of LLM agents' learning and strategy-formulation capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

### [2] [Inverse Knowledge Search over Verifiable Reasoning: Synthesizing a Scientific Encyclopedia from a Long Chains-of-Thought Knowledge Base](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26854)
*Yu Li,Yuan Huang,Tao Wang,Caiyu Fan,Xiansheng Cai,Sihan Hu,Xinzijian Liu,Cheng Shi,Mingjun Xu,Zhen Wang,Yan Wang,Xiangqi Jin,Tianhan Zhang,Linfeng Zhang,Lei Wang,Youjin Deng,Pan Zhang,Weijie Sun,Xingyu Li,Weinan E,Linfeng Zhang,Zhiyuan Yao,Kun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to decompress scientific reasoning by creating a verified Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base, facilitating trustworthy and detailed scientific synthesis in a scalable encyclopedia format, SciencePedia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific materials are often compressed, omitting reasoning chains that prevent verification and hinder cross-domain connections. This paper aims to remedy these issues by enabling explicit, step-by-step justifications.

Method: The framework employs a Socratic agent to generate millions of first-principle questions, filtered through solvers and cross-model consensus. A Brainstorm Search Engine retrieves derivations, and the Plato synthesizer constructs coherent articles, creating SciencePedia entries from verified reasoning.

Result: SciencePedia consists of 200,000 detailed entries across disciplines with higher knowledge density and lower error rates compared to baselines. Evaluations reveal reliable synthesis and derivations powered by the verified LCoT knowledge base.

Conclusion: The scalable, reasoning-centric approach creates an expandable and trustworthy scientific encyclopedia, addressing verification and cross-domain integration challenges by leveraging a verified knowledge base.

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Denario is an AI multi-agent system for scientific research, conducting tasks from idea generation to paper drafting and evaluation across numerous scientific disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for AI tools to assist in complex, interdisciplinary scientific research processes.

Method: Modular architecture enabling both individual task execution and end-to-end scientific analysis, with Cmbagent as a deep-research backend.

Result: Demonstrated capabilities by generating papers in diverse fields and combining interdisciplinary approaches; validated by expert evaluations.

Conclusion: Denario exhibits significant potential in aiding research processes, presenting opportunities and ethical discussions in AI-driven science, while highlighting current limitations.

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a
scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such
as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,
writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a
scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle
specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end
scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we
describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by
presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different
scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical
informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,
neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from
different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies
methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We
report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who
provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the
strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we
discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such
technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code
at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run
directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and
the full app will be deployed on the cloud.

### [4] [Cognition Envelopes for Bounded AI Reasoning in Autonomous UAS Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26905)
*Pedro Antonio Alarcón Granadeno,Arturo Miguel Bernal Russell,Sofia Nelson,Demetrius Hernandez,Maureen Petterson,Michael Murphy,Walter J. Scheirer,Jane Cleland-Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The abstract proposes 'Cognition Envelopes,' a framework ensuring error mitigation in decisions made by AI models, enhancing the autonomy of cyber-physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address errors like hallucinations, overgeneralizations, and context misalignments in decisions made by advanced AI models, which can lead to flawed operations in cyber-physical systems.

Method: The authors introduce 'Cognition Envelopes,' a concept establishing reasoning boundaries for AI-generated decisions. These are designed to enhance decision safety alongside meta-cognition and traditional safety measures.

Result: The abstract suggests that Cognition Envelopes serve as a complementary mechanism to mitigate AI errors, thereby aiding systematic assurance and validation in cyber-physical systems.

Conclusion: Cognition Envelopes are proposed as a necessary addition to existing safety frameworks to better manage reasoning errors and improve the reliability of AI in cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy
through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models
also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations,
overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and
flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition
Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,
validation, and assurance.

### [6] [Causal Masking on Spatial Data: An Information-Theoretic Case for Learning Spatial Datasets with Unimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27009)
*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the effectiveness of causal masking in language models on spatial data, using chess as a study domain. Models trained on spatial representations outperform sequential ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if causal masking, traditionally used for sequential data, is effective on spatial data, notably in domains that support both spatial and sequential representations.

Method: Language models were trained on chess data using both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) representations, with bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms.

Result: Models trained on spatial representations, even with causal masking, showed stronger chess playing performance compared to models trained on sequential data.

Conclusion: Causal masking can be successfully applied to spatial data, making it a valid and sometimes preferable method for training models on spatial domains.

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

### [7] [e1: Learning Adaptive Control of Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27042)
*Michael Kleinman,Matthew Trager,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Effort Control, a method for dynamically adjusting the reasoning effort of AI models via a user-specified fraction of processing effort, improving task-specific performance and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users require mechanisms to customize AI reasoning effort to balance accuracy, latency, and costs effectively, especially since current solutions lack precise control or demand prior knowledge of problem difficulty.

Method: A reinforcement learning-based Adaptive Effort Control is proposed, where models adaptively allocate reasoning based on a relative effort criterion specified by the user, eliminating specific tuning requirements.

Result: This approach achieves a 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving accuracy, providing a superior cost-accuracy tradeoff across models of various sizes.

Conclusion: Adaptive Effort Control allows dynamic adjustment of AI reasoning with improved efficiency and performance, making adaptive resource allocation proportional to task complexity feasible across different model scales.

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

### [8] [Adaptive Data Flywheel: Applying MAPE Control Loops to AI Agent Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27051)
*Aaditya Shukla,Sidney Knowles,Meenakshi Madugula,Dave Farris,Ryan Angilly,Santiago Pombo,Anbang Xu,Lu An,Abhinav Balasubramanian,Tan Yu,Jiaxiang Ren,Rama Akkiraju*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper details NVIDIA's use of a data flywheel in their AI agent NVInfo AI to systematically improve accuracy and reduce latency using human-in-the-loop feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise AI must adapt to evolving user needs while addressing technical challenges like accuracy, latency, and alignment issues.

Method: Operationalize a MAPE-driven data flywheel to create a closed-loop system that integrates feedback and improves retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.

Result: Targeted improvements including fine-tuning models; the routing system achieved 96% accuracy with reduced latency and smaller model size, while query rephrasal improved accuracy and reduced latency.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop feedback structured in a data flywheel creates self-improving enterprise AI systems; this approach offers a scalable blueprint for adaptive AI agent development.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

*Hamed Mahdavi,Pouria Mahdavinia,Alireza Farhadi,Pegah Mohammadipour,Samira Malek,Majid Daliri,Pedram Mohammadipour,Alireza Hashemi,Amir Khasahmadi,Vasant Honavar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how well state-of-the-art LLMs can grade proofs beyond binary correctness, finding reliability in detecting errors but calibration issues for assigning partial credit. A proposed agentic grading workflow enhances grading accuracy and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs advancing in solving challenging mathematical problems, understanding how well they perform in grading proofs is crucial for applications in education and automated evaluation.

Method: The study involves analyzing 90 solutions generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro and MathArena IMO/USAMO sets, manually annotated, alongside introducing new grading workflows that automate reference extraction and rubric creation.

Result: LLMs reliably detect incorrect solutions but struggle with assigning partial credit appropriately. The proposed grading workflows improve human-grade alignment and consistency in partial credit allocation.

Conclusion: Enhanced workflows significantly improve grading accuracy and handling of partial credit, offering a promising approach to automated proof evaluation. Supporting resources are shared for further research.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Glia, an AI system employing large language models in a multi-agent workflow, autonomously designs mechanisms for networked systems and achieves human expert-level quality while offering insights into workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI can autonomously design complex networked systems with creativity and reasoning akin to human experts.

Method: Glia employs a multi-agent architecture combining LLMs for reasoning, experimentation, and analysis. It incorporates an evaluation framework to anchor abstract reasoning within empirical validations.

Result: Glia successfully generates high-quality interpretable designs for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling, matching human experts' performance and uncovering novel workload insights.

Conclusion: The study illustrates AI's potential to creatively and transparently solve complex systems challenges by integrating reasoning models with empirical experimentation.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for
complex systems problems.

### [11] [From product to system network challenges in system of systems lifecycle management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27194)
*Vahid Salehi,Josef Vilsmeier,Shirui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the shift from isolated product life cycle models to interconnected system-of-systems (SoS) lifecycle management using MBSE, PLM, CAD-CAE, and digital twin technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper emphasizes the need for a new framework due to the increasing complexities of networked system nodes and their interoperability issues.

Method: The paper proposes four key principles and a three-step roadmap for transitioning to network-centric development.

Result: The suggested approach leads to benefits like improved robustness, reuse, shorter throughput times, and informed sustainability decisions.

Conclusion: It provides actionable guidelines for practitioners to manage complexity and scale SoS value streams effectively.

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

### [12] [LAFA: Agentic LLM-Driven Federated Analytics over Decentralized Data Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18477)
*Haichao Ji,Zibo Wang,Cheng Pan,Meng Han,Yifei Zhu,Dan Wang,Zhu Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAFA introduces a system integrating large language models (LLMs) with federated analytics (FA), enabling privacy-preserving, natural language-based data analytics across distributed sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-agent-based frameworks lack privacy features for centralized data access, while federated analytics supports distributed sources but not natural language input.

Method: LAFA employs a hierarchical multi-agent system to transform natural language queries into optimized FA workflows using planners, optimizers, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

Result: LAFA achieves higher execution plan success rates and reduces resource-heavy operations compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates how privacy-preserving, natural language analytics can be effectively implemented in federated settings using a novel multi-agent framework.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

*Kounianhua Du,Jianxing Liu,Kangning Zhang,Wenxiang Jiao,Yuan Lu,Jiarui Jin,Weiwen Liu,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for adapting large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences, focusing on challenges like dynamic user patterns and data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing need for personalized large language models, which struggle with adaptability and data efficiency in dynamic environments.

Method: A novel framework that generates sample-level interference vectors dynamically from user data. These vectors are injected into the model during its forward pass using two key components: fine-grained steering (utilizing activations) and input-aware aggregation (contextual synthesis).

Result: The approach effectively enhances personalization performance across scenarios such as text generation and web function calling, especially in fast-changing and sparse data environments, demonstrating high flexibility and compatibility.

Conclusion: The method improves personalization in LLMs, providing robustness in diverse environments while being compatible as a plug-in with existing personalization techniques.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

*Tao Liu,Chongyu Wang,Rongjie Li,Yingchen Yu,Xuming He,Bai Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces "GUI-Rise," a novel framework for GUI navigation agents that integrates reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization. It achieves state-of-the-art results, especially in cross-domain scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cross-domain generalization and effective history utilization limitations in GUI navigation agent models.

Method: The framework incorporates structured reasoning (Chain-of-Thought analyses), action prediction, history summarization, and trains using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (GRPO). Specialized rewards such as history-aware objectives enhance performance.

Result: It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks with strong results in out-of-domain tests, proving robust reasoning and generalization abilities.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enhances reasoning and improves cross-domain generalization in GUI navigation tasks, demonstrating significant advancements and practical application.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

### [15] [Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Unordered Tasks: From Boolean to Coupled Reward Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27329)
*Kristina Levina,Nikolaos Pappas,Athanasios Karapantelakis,Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of reward machines (RMs) in long-horizon problems by introducing three generalizations and proposes a new algorithm, Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM), which scales better for tasks with unordered subtasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the inefficiency of reward machines in learning long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks, as traditional RMs struggle with an exponential increase in learning complexity.

Method: The authors introduce three types of generalized reward machines: Numeric RMs (compact task expression), Agenda RMs (tracking subtasks in an agenda), and Coupled RMs (states tied to subtasks). Additionally, they propose Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM) as a new learning algorithm.

Result: Experiments indicate that CoRM performs better than existing RM algorithms for scaled long-horizon tasks with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that augmenting reward machines and introducing CoRM helps overcome scalability challenges in long-horizon non-Markovian task learning.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

*Ali Norouzifar,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve process discovery by distinguishing between desirable and undesirable process executions, grouping them, and creating focused models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of generic process models that fail to capture distinctions between desirable and undesirable executions, impacting conformance checking and performance analysis.

Method: The method involves learning discriminative rules over control-flow features, grouping traces based on desirability, and applying process discovery separately within each group.

Result: The approach leads to interpretable and focused process models, effectively isolating and visualizing critical patterns in real-life event logs.

Conclusion: A more outcome-aware process discovery improves understanding of drivers behind process executions, enhancing analysis and yielding actionable insights into both desirable and undesirable behaviors.

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

### [17] [An In-depth Study of LLM Contributions to the Bin Packing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27353)
*Julien Herrmann,Guillaume Pallez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reassesses claims that LLMs could contribute to mathematical discovery through heuristics for bin packing problems, proposing simpler and more efficient algorithms as better alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the validity of claims that LLM-guided genetic algorithms contribute to mathematical discovery in solving online bin packing problems.

Method: Detailed analysis of LLM-generated heuristics and comparison with newly proposed tailored algorithms for online bin packing problems.

Result: Proposed algorithms are simpler, more efficient, interpretable, and generalizable compared to LLM-generated heuristics, indicating simpler problem instances.

Conclusion: The study questions LLMs' contribution to mathematical discovery in this context and stresses the importance of thorough validation and contextualization of LLM-generated outputs.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

*Mengjie Deng,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolScope, a framework for multimodal large language models, improves efficiency in reasoning tasks with external tools, achieving up to +6.69% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show great promise in problem-solving but face challenges in multimodal reasoning due to complex, varied information.

Method: ToolScope uses a three-part framework: Global Navigator for strategic guidance, Agentic Executor for tool integration, and Response Synthesizer for coherent outputs.

Result: ToolScope enhances multimodal reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolScope efficiently integrates external tools in multimodal contexts, boosting problem-solving capabilities and generalization performance of MLLMs.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

### [19] [Realistic pedestrian-driver interaction modelling using multi-agent RL with human perceptual-motor constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27383)
*Yueyang Wang,Mehmet Dogar,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model that incorporates human visual and motor constraints to improve the realism of pedestrian-driver interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the modelling of interactions between pedestrians and drivers by incorporating sensory and motor constraints, addressing the limitations of current rule-based, game-theoretic, or 'black-box' machine learning models.

Method: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework is proposed, which integrates visual and motor constraints. Four model variants, with and without constraints, are evaluated using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised pedestrian crossing.

Result: The model incorporating both visual and motor constraints performs the best, resulting in smoother movements, cautious behaviour, and better adaptations to perceptual uncertainty. It surpasses a supervised behavioural cloning model, even in a data-limited environment.

Conclusion: Multi-agent reinforcement learning with human-like constraints is an effective approach for simulating realistic pedestrian-driver interactions and accounts for individual differences via population-level distribution parameters.

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

*Jianwen Sun,Yukang Feng,Yifan Chang,Chuanhao Li,Zizhen Li,Jiaxin Ai,Fanrui Zhang,Yu Dai,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of the 'intention expression gap' in human-AI collaboration and proposes a new agent, Nous, with a training framework based on information theory to enhance user intent understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to overcome the 'intention expression gap'—the difficulty humans face when conveying high-dimensional thoughts to AI—leading to inefficient interactions.

Method: The authors introduced Nous, an agent trained with an inquiry policy using an information-theory-based framework. Information gain from dialogue serves as an intrinsic reward signal, measured by reductions in Shannon entropy.

Result: The authors validated their method with a simulation pipeline for scientific diagram generation, showing Nous achieves high efficiency, quality of outputs, and robustness across varying user expertise.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the proposed framework is a scalable, adaptive approach to resolving user intent uncertainty, with potential application across domains beyond diagram generation.

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

*Tian Liang,Wenxiang Jiao,Zhiwei He,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepCompress, a framework improving both accuracy and efficiency of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by employing an adaptive length reward mechanism that adjusts reasoning paths based on problem complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from addressing cognitive inefficiencies in LRMs, such as overthinking simple problems and underthinking complex ones, while aiming to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.

Method: DeepCompress dynamically classifies problems as "Simple" or "Hard" and uses an adaptive reward system. It encourages shorter reasoning paths for simple problems and longer explorative paths for complex ones, adjusting the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process accordingly.

Result: DeepCompress achieves superior accuracy and improved token efficiency in experiments conducted on challenging mathematical benchmarks, outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances the cognitive efficiency of LRMs without compromising their accuracy, offering a significant improvement in handling problems of varying complexity.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

*Yuhao Zhang,Dingxin Hu,Tinghao Yu,Hao Liu,Yiting Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoFM, a new method for synthesizing high-fidelity geometric data using formal languages, addressing limitations in current synthetic geometric data generation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating synthetic geometric data are limited by lack of diversity, noise, and reduced authenticity, hindering effective mathematical geometric reasoning in multi-modal large language models.

Method: GeoFM employs formal languages and symbolic engines to explore condition combinations in metric spaces, producing diverse and accurate geometric problems.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate performance improvements, with models trained using GeoFM-generated data outperforming GPT-4o by over 18% on MathVista and over 16% on GeoQA.

Conclusion: GeoFM offers a superior approach to generating synthetic geometric data, improving multi-modal large language models' capabilities in geometry problem-solving tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

### [23] [Mechanics of Learned Reasoning 1: TempoBench, A Benchmark for Interpretable Deconstruction of Reasoning System Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27544)
*Nikolaus Holzer,William Fishell,Baishakhi Ray,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TempoBench, a novel benchmark to evaluate the multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs through temporal trace evaluation (TTE) and temporal causal evaluation (TCE). Results show that while LLMs have a basic understanding of the tasks (65.6% on TCE-normal), performance drops significantly as system complexity increases (7.5% on TCE-hard).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the gap in existing methodologies for evaluating reasoning abilities of LLMs. Existing approaches either rely on ad-hoc datasets with potential bias or use formal proof systems like Lean that lack real-world alignment for agentic decision chains. There is a need for a formally grounded yet practically useful reasoning benchmark.

Method: The authors developed a new diagnostic benchmark, TempoBench, which systematically evaluates LLM reasoning abilities through two key tests: Temporal Trace Evaluation (TTE) for reasoning simulation and Temporal Causal Evaluation (TCE) for multi-step causal reasoning. The benchmark also parametrizes task difficulty to test performance across complexity levels.

Result: The results demonstrate that LLMs perform relatively well under standard complexity settings (65.6% accuracy on TCE-normal) but struggle significantly with higher complexity tasks (7.5% accuracy on TCE-hard), indicating a performance drop as reasoning complexity increases.

Conclusion: TempoBench is the first of its kind to provide a formally grounded and verifiable diagnostic reasoning benchmark for LLMs, bridging the trade-offs between mathematical proof systems and real-world reasoning tasks. The poor performance on higher complexity tasks highlights areas for improvement in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our

TL;DR: SIGMA is a new framework employing multi-agent systems for improved mathematical reasoning, with results showing enhanced accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with integrating information from multiple sources and lack flexibility in search strategies for mathematical reasoning tasks.

Method: SIGMA uses specialized agents that independently reason, search, and integrate information through a moderation mechanism to achieve context-sensitive and efficient knowledge synthesis.

Result: SIGMA outperformed state-of-the-art systems on benchmarks like MATH500, AIME, and GPQA, achieving a 7.4% performance improvement.

Conclusion: This multi-agent approach provides a scalable, efficient solution for complex reasoning and problem-solving, highlighting its potential for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate AI agents performing realistic, end-to-end research tasks using large language models, as current benchmarks are narrowly focused and simplified.

Method: InnovatorBench consists of diverse tasks requiring runnable artifacts, assessed for correctness, performance, and quality. ResearchGym provides a research environment to test agents with complex actions and long-term operations. They tested these using a ReAct agent with reasoning and executable planning capability.

Result: Frontier AI models show potential but face challenges in complex decision-making, algorithm-based tasks, and resource management. Agents require extensive runtime (over 11 hours) to achieve performance benchmarks.

Conclusion: InnovatorBench is a promising next-generation benchmark for code-based research, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of current AI models and accelerating the development of capable research agents.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

TL;DR: VeriMoA is a training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework that enhances automated RTL HDL design generation using Large Language Models, achieving 15-30% improvements without costly training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in automating RTL design through HDL generation, specifically targeting the limitations of LLMs like domain-specific constraints and restricted reasoning capabilities.

Method: The proposed VeriMoA framework integrates two innovations: a quality-guided caching mechanism for ranking intermediate outputs and a multi-path generation strategy using C++ and Python intermediate representations.

Result: VeriMoA significantly improves LLM performance on VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks, achieving 15–30% better Pass@1 scores across different LLMs.

Conclusion: VeriMoA enhances computational design processes, enables smaller models to match larger ones, and eliminates the need for expensive LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal and analyze potential security risks in MLLM-based embodied agents, specifically visual backdoor vulnerabilities.

Method: BEAT framework designs a diverse training set and applies a two-stage training involving supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) to handle object triggers effectively.

Result: BEAT achieved up to 80% attack success rates, generalizing effectively to out-of-distribution environments, and demonstrated a significant improvement in backdoor activation with CTL.

Conclusion: The study highlights a critical security vulnerability in MLLM-based embodied agents, emphasizing the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms before real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

### [28] [Validity Is What You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27628)
*Sebastian Benthall,Andrew Clark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new definition for Agentic AI, positioning it as autonomous software akin to SaaS and emphasizes the importance of validation by end-users and stakeholders, suggesting that simpler models can sometimes replace LLMs if they fulfill application needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine Agentic AI in practical terms as autonomous software applications, emphasizing their reliance on user and stakeholder validation rather than solely on foundational AI models.

Method: The paper analyzes the distinction between Agentic AI applications and foundational AI models, introducing a realist definition and exploring how validation measures influence model selection in complex enterprise systems.

Result: It highlights that the success of Agentic AI relies on validation measures that ensure application usability and effectiveness. In some cases, simpler interpretable models suffice over complex foundation models like LLMs.

Conclusion: Validation and practical performance are key for Agentic AI's success, often overshadowing the need for advanced models like LLMs in real-world, complex enterprise settings.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

TL;DR: Apollo framework enables efficient training of large language models on long-horizon, domain-specific tasks by combining human guidance with action-level data filtering, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of training LLMs for long-horizon, domain-specific tasks where traditional methods are either too expensive or prone to collapse.

Method: Apollo uses asynchronous human guidance for interventions during drift and applies supervision control to filter sub-optimal actions, ensuring effective data collection.

Result: Applied to the GLM-4.5 model using InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves a 50% performance improvement over the untrained baseline and a 28% improvement compared to training without human interaction.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop processes and Apollo's robust framework are pivotal for enhancing LLM performance on challenging long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MolChord, a novel framework integrating text and structural data for improved structure-based drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in aligning protein and molecular structural representations with text descriptions, ensuring generated drugs meet pharmacological properties.

Method: MolChord utilizes NatureLM as a molecule generator, diffusion-based encoders for structural alignment, and refines the process with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) via property-aware datasets.

Result: MolChord achieves state-of-the-art results on key metrics evaluated with the CrossDocked2020 dataset, confirming alignment and effectiveness.

Conclusion: MolChord shows significant promise in structure-based drug discovery, offering a practical and high-performing tool by aligning multimodal data and molecular properties.

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate
molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively
aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and
ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological
properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we
propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and
molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential
representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we
leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and
proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure
encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a
property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment
process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on
CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a
practical tool for SBDD.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Choreographer is a simulation framework that evaluates fine-grained accelerators for latency-sensitive tasks, emphasizing accurate cache modeling and hardware-software interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of accurate system-level evaluation tools to study fine-grained accelerator performance, especially for latency-sensitive applications.

Method: Choreographer integrates a gem5 hardware stack and Linux-based software stack, with coherent hub interface networks and detailed cache modeling capabilities. It allows modular C++ configurations for prototyping and testing.

Result: Through case studies, Choreographer demonstrated speedups of 1.08x to 1.88x for prefetchers and over 2x for a quicksort accelerator, highlighting its ability to optimize hardware-software interactions.

Conclusion: Choreographer offers a robust simulation framework for evaluating and optimizing fine-grained accelerators, advancing the study of cache impacts and hardware/software interplay.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Choreographer, a simulation framework that
enables a holistic system-level evaluation of fine-grained accelerators
designed for latency-sensitive tasks. Unlike existing frameworks, Choreographer
captures all hardware and software overheads in core-accelerator and
cache-accelerator interactions, integrating a detailed gem5-based hardware
stack featuring an AMBA coherent hub interface (CHI) mesh network and a
complete Linux-based software stack. To facilitate rapid prototyping, it offers
a C++ application programming interface and modular configuration options. Our
detailed cache model provides accurate insights into performance variations
caused by cache configurations, which are not captured by other frameworks. The
framework is demonstrated through two case studies: a data-aware prefetcher for
graph analytics workloads, and a quicksort accelerator. Our evaluation shows
that the prefetcher achieves speedups between 1.08x and 1.88x by reducing
memory access latency, while the quicksort accelerator delivers more than 2x
speedup with minimal address translation overhead. These findings underscore
the ability of Choreographer to model complex hardware-software interactions
and optimize performance in small task offloading scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern systems lack native mechanisms to propagate high-level program semantics, creating a gap between hardware and software that affects security and efficiency.

Method: The paper provides a systematic survey of descriptor-based memory systems, introduces foundational concepts, and proposes a taxonomy for descriptor addressing modes to analyze implementations.

Result: Descriptor-based memory systems holistically address challenges in memory protection, management, and processing. A unified analysis reexamines the CentroID model as a practical solution.

Conclusion: Cross-layer communication of object semantics is key to future innovations in cache hierarchies, unified virtual memory, and 128-bit systems.

Abstract: The security and efficiency of modern computing systems are fundamentally
undermined by the absence of a native architectural mechanism to propagate
high-level program semantics, such as object identity, bounds, and lifetime,
across the hardware/software interface. This paper presents a comprehensive
survey of the architectural paradigm designed to bridge this semantic gap:
descriptor-based, object-aware memory systems. By elevating the descriptor to a
first-class architectural abstraction, this paradigm enables hardware to
dynamically acquire and enforce the rich semantics of software-defined objects.
This survey systematically charts the evolution and current landscape of this
approach. We establish the foundational concepts of memory objects and
descriptors and introduce a novel taxonomy of descriptor addressing modes,
providing a structured framework for analyzing and comparing diverse
implementations. Our unified analysis reveals how this paradigm holistically
addresses the intertwined challenges of memory protection, management, and
processing. As a culminating case study, we re-examine the CentroID model,
demonstrating how its hybrid tagged-pointer encoding and descriptor processing
mechanisms embody the path toward practical and efficient object-aware designs.
Finally, we outline how the explicit cross-layer communication of object
semantics provides a foundational research direction for next-generation cache
hierarchies, unified virtual memory, and even 128-bit architectures.

Method: A two-stage hierarchical retrieval architecture combining approximate retrieval for candidate generation and precise retrieval using pre-selected document embeddings.

Result: Simulation results show nearly 50% reduction in memory access, 75% reduction in computation, and energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 μJ/query under TSMC 28nm technology.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively improves energy efficiency and retrieval accuracy in edge RAG systems, making them more viable for medical AI applications.

Abstract: With powerful and integrative large language models (LLMs), medical AI agents
have demonstrated unique advantages in providing personalized medical
consultations, continuous health monitoring, and precise treatment plans.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates personal medical documents into
LLMs by an external retrievable database to address the costly retraining or
fine-tuning issues in deploying customized agents. While deploying medical
agents in edge devices ensures privacy protection, RAG implementations impose
substantial memory access and energy consumption during the retrieval stage.
This paper presents a hierarchical retrieval architecture for edge RAG,
leveraging a two-stage retrieval scheme that combines approximate retrieval for
candidate set generation, followed by high-precision retrieval on pre-selected
document embeddings. The proposed architecture significantly reduces energy
consumption and external memory access while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
Simulation results show that, under TSMC 28nm technology, the proposed
hierarchical retrieval architecture has reduced the overall memory access by
nearly 50% and the computation by 75% compared to pure INT8 retrieval, and the
total energy consumption for 1 MB data retrieval is 177.76 {\mu}J/query.

Method: The paper analyzes sequential and parallel integrations of SSM and attention layers, and proposes a continual paraphrase-augmented training approach to improve model performance.

Result: Parallel hybrids excel in longer contexts, sequential hybrids perform better on shorter contexts, and the paraphrase-augmented training approach generalizes well, enhancing recall and preserving other functionalities.

Conclusion: Hybrid SSM-attention models can be optimized for various tasks by selecting appropriate architectural designs and applying data-centric training methods, yielding insights for practical implementation.

Abstract: Hybrid models that combine state space models (SSMs) with attention
mechanisms have shown strong performance by leveraging the efficiency of SSMs
and the high recall ability of attention. However, the architectural design

their effectiveness. We first examine the distinction between sequential and
parallel integration of SSM and attention layers. Our analysis reveals several
interesting findings, including that sequential hybrids perform better on
shorter contexts, whereas parallel hybrids are more effective for longer
contexts. We also introduce a data-centric approach of continually training on
datasets augmented with paraphrases, which further enhances recall while
preserving other capabilities. It generalizes well across different base models
and outperforms architectural modifications aimed at enhancing recall. Our
findings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and
offer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to various use

Result: The methodology achieves a precision of 0.726 in detecting reports of violence, validated through manual evaluation by linguists.

Conclusion: The approach is efficient, adaptable, and contributes to ethical and explainable uses of NLP in public health surveillance across diverse contexts.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the

fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient NLP systems and lightweight language models driven by the demand and drawbacks of manual design or training-centered NAS methods.

Method: W-PCA uses parameter count and principal components as evaluation proxies, eliminating gradient computations to enhance efficiency in evaluating lightweight models.

Result: Significant reduction in training time and improved testing scores on GLUE and SQuAD datasets. Superior ranking correlation in FlexiBERT search space compared to other zero-shot NAS methods.

Conclusion: W-PCA proves effective for optimizing lightweight language models with reduced computational complexity and improved evaluation performance.

Abstract: The demand for efficient natural language processing (NLP) systems has led to
the development of lightweight language models. Previous work in this area has
primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search
(NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for
evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing
approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation
metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce
weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored
for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies:
the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative
contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer.
Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize
the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating
lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and
SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our
method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and
achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous
state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking
evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach
exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared
to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOPSIDED, a privacy agent framework for safeguarding sensitive PII in conversational AI by pseudonymizing and depseudonymizing data while preserving semantic integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing use of conversational AI poses risks of privacy leaks from shared sensitive personal data and PII exposing individuals to security issues like identity theft.

Method: The presented framework, LOPSIDED, pseudonymizes sensitive PII entities in user inputs while maintaining semantic consistency. It ensures improved privacy without degrading response quality, and depseudonymizes responses for the end-user.

Result: Evaluation using real-world data from ShareGPT demonstrated that LOPSIDED reduced semantic utility errors compared to baseline methods by a factor of 5 while improving data privacy.

Conclusion: LOPSIDED offers significant improvement in securing sensitive user data in conversational AI systems, ensuring both privacy and contextual correctness in interactions.

Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a token-specific cascading method for test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) using guidance from a smaller aligned model, aiming to address the high computational costs associated with scaling LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to meet downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, but the computational cost of alignment increases significantly with scaling.

Method: The authors introduce a proxy-based test-time alignment approach utilizing a smaller aligned model for guidance. They propose a token-specific cascading method based on a 0-1 knapsack problem and derive primal and dual approximations for optimal deferral decisions.

Result: Experimental studies validate the proposed method's benefits in improving task performance and speculative decoding speed.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that proxy-based test-time alignment with token-specific cascading offers an effective solution to reduce computational expenses while achieving improved results in LLM task alignment.

Abstract: Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation
capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during
pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to
downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired
properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost
of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment,
i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described
as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is
reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual
approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the
benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.

TL;DR: This study introduces a sexism detection dataset for the low-resource Hausa language, highlighting cultural and linguistic challenges in identifying sexism using computational approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of computational sexism detection models for low-resource languages like Hausa and understand how sexism is expressed in culturally specific ways.

Method: The study developed a dataset using community engagement, qualitative coding, data augmentation, and a two-stage user study. Machine learning classifiers and multilingual language models were tested for sexism detection.

Result: Challenges include cultural nuances affecting sexism detection, particularly idiomatic and clarification-seeking expressions. Several false positives were observed in identifying sexism.

Conclusion: Detecting sexism in Hausa remains challenging due to cultural and linguistic complexities, but this dataset provides a foundation for further advancements in low-resource language sexism detection.

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

### [44] [Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049)
*Ponrawee Prasertsom,Andrea Silvi,Jennifer Culbertson,Moa Johansson,Devdatt Dubhashi,Kenny Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the optimization of numeral systems by integrating regularity and processing complexity using the Minimum Description Length approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Past attempts to show why natural numeral systems optimize a trade-off struggled due to neglecting the regularity aspect central to human grammar.

Method: The authors employ the Minimum Description Length approach to measure regularity and processing complexity, improving the analysis of natural and unnatural numeral systems.

Result: The MDL-based measures distinguish natural numeral systems and support why ad-hoc constraints are unnecessary by explaining them through regularity.

Conclusion: Regularity should be integrated into studies of numeral system optimality, as it provides a natural explanation for constraints without relying on ad-hoc methods.

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

*Ashley Lewis,Andrew Perrault,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VISTA is a framework developed to improve hallucination detection in conversational AI by verifying factuality through claim-level analysis and sequential consistency tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of hallucination in conversational AI systems, which undermines their factual reliability, particularly in multi-turn dialogues.

Method: VISTA decomposes assistant responses into atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue history, then categorizes unverifiable statements.

Result: VISTA outperforms current baselines (FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge) in hallucination detection, validated through human evaluations.

Conclusion: VISTA enhances factuality evaluation with improved human alignment and transparency, fostering reliable conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

*Xiaofan Guo,Yaxuan Luan,Yue Kang,Xiangchen Song,Jinxu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel confidence control method for improving retrieval-augmented generation in complex knowledge environments by integrating memory indexing with uncertainty estimation, achieving superior performance in various metrics and enhancing reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle issues such as insufficient coverage, unstable results, and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation when dealing with complex knowledge environments.

Method: The method involves creating a hierarchical memory structure for multi-granularity indexing combined with uncertainty estimation to filter low-confidence paths during generation. Optimization objectives include generation loss, entropy constraints, and variance regularization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments confirm the method's stability and robustness, outperforming existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves reliability and controllability in complex contexts and offers a new pathway for retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDeC is a method to detect training contamination in large language models by analyzing in-context learning effects on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a practical method to detect and quantify training contamination in large language models.

Method: CoDeC assesses contamination by observing how in-context examples affect model confidence, specifically identifying memorization disruption patterns.

Result: CoDeC produces interpretable contamination scores that differentiate between seen and unseen datasets, uncovering signs of memorization in open-weight models.

Conclusion: CoDeC is straightforward, automated, and compatible across models and datasets, offering a practical solution for contamination detection in benchmarking setups.

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fine-tuning method combining contrastive distillation and noise-robust training to improve language model alignment and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety alignment and robustness limitations in large-scale language models.

Method: The method uses contrastive distillation to transfer knowledge boundaries alongside noise-robust constraints during training, forming a unified optimization framework.

Result: The proposed approach improves semantic alignment, robustness, and safety outperforming baseline models across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The work offers a parameter-efficient fine-tuning solution enhancing language model safety and trustworthiness.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

*Adel Khorramrouz,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies biases in the safety guardrails of large language models (LLMs) that lead to selective refusal of content generation, varying across demographic groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and address biases in LLM safety measures that could inadvertently reinforce inequities across demographic groups.

Method: The study examines refusal rates, response types, and generated refusal lengths for individual and intersectional demographic groups, and tests indirect attacks on groups previously refused.

Result: The study found evidence of selective refusal biases in LLMs across gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and religion attributes.

Conclusion: The findings stress the importance of improving LLM safety guardrails to ensure equitable and bias-free performance across diverse demographic groups.

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

### [50] [Rating Roulette: Self-Inconsistency in LLM-As-A-Judge Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27106)
*Rajarshi Haldar,Julia Hockenmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM judges for NLG evaluation show inconsistency in scores across runs, indicating unreliable assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating NLG reliably as LLM-based metrics have gained traction for aligning better with human preferences.

Method: Experiments were conducted to analyze the intra-rater reliability of LLM judges in scoring NLG tasks and benchmarks.

Result: Low intra-rater reliability in LLM judges was observed, leading to inconsistent ratings across runs.

Conclusion: While LLM judges exhibit inconsistency, careful and guided use could still make them viable for NLG evaluation.

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper characterizes the probability distributions that transformer language models can express.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the expressivity of transformer language models when used autoregressively and probabilistically, which aligns with their practical use.

Method: The authors analyze the functions and distributions that transformers can express when used autoregressively and probabilistically.

Result: The expressivity of transformer models increases with autoregression, and probabilistic modeling alters equivalences present in non-probabilistic setups.

Conclusion: Transformer models gain unique expressive capabilities when applied probabilistically and autoregressively into their common practical usage.

Abstract: Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers
(which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as
language models (which generate strings autoregressively and
probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that
transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper enhances the URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base by addressing data sparsity issues, introducing new features, and improving coverage and imputation quality for better multilingual research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data sparsity in URIEL+, which limits its utility in cross-lingual transfer and low-resource language support.

Method: The paper introduces script vectors, integrates additional language data from Glottolog, and expands lineage imputation to propagate features across genealogies.

Result: It reduced feature sparsity by 14%, expanded language coverage by up to 19,015 languages (a 1,007% increase), and improved imputation quality by up to 33%. Cross-lingual task benchmarking showed performance gains up to 6% in some setups.

Conclusion: These enhancements make URIEL+ more comprehensive and inclusive, benefiting multilingual research, especially for low-resource languages.

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemeArena, a framework improving the evaluation of multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) in understanding harmful memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of nuanced evaluation for mLLMs in interpreting multimodal harmfulness, beyond binary classification tasks.

Method: The framework simulates diverse interpretive contexts for analysis, incorporates multiple viewpoints, and fosters consensus among evaluators for unbiased assessments.

Result: Experiments show MemeArena reduces bias in evaluation and aligns judgment results with human preferences.

Conclusion: MemeArena offers a reliable, unbiased approach to evaluating mLLMs' ability to interpret harmful memes, enhancing multimodal harmfulness understanding.

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

*Yulin Ou,Yu Wang,Yang Xu,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method (APS) to detect periodic patterns in the information density of natural language, uncovering structured and long-distance factors causing periodicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether and to what degree natural language demonstrates periodic patterns in its encoded information, building on advancements in information density theory.

Method: Introduced the AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS) method, which applies a periodicity detection algorithm to analyze surprisal sequences in text and confirms results with harmonic regression modeling.

Result: Found that natural language exhibits strong periodic patterns in information, with some unexpected periods beyond typical structural boundaries, verified via modeling.

Conclusion: Periodic information patterns in language are influenced by structured and long-distance factors, and APS can be advantageous for tasks like LLM-generation detection.

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

*Mohammad Tavakoli,Alireza Salemi,Carrie Ye,Mohamed Abdalla,Hamed Zamani,J Ross Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current benchmarks for evaluating long-context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by introducing a new benchmark (BEAM) and a memory-enhancing framework (LIGHT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for testing long-context reasoning in LLMs lack narrative coherence, cover limited domains, and are confined to simple recall tasks.

Method: The authors developed BEAM, a benchmark consisting of 100 diverse and coherent conversations with 2,000 validated questions targeting various memory abilities. They also introduced LIGHT, a framework that equips LLMs with episodic, short-term, and scratchpad memory systems.

Result: Experiments show LLMs struggle with increasing dialogue length, even with large token context windows. However, applying the LIGHT framework improved model performance by 3.5%-12.69%, depending on the backbone LLM.

Conclusion: Using BEAM and LIGHT significantly enhances the evaluation and performance of LLMs in long-context reasoning tasks, highlighting the potential of memory systems in improving model capabilities.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLINK, a method to improve bilingual language model performance without changing the tokenizer or retraining the decoder, focusing on low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuned LLMs underperform with low-resource, non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer issues and weak cross-lingual alignment, highlighting the need for effective methods to address these limitations.

Method: LLINK uses a frozen multilingual encoder aligned to the decoder's latent space via a contrastive projector and expands the vector into soft slots, enabling efficient signal use by the frozen decoder.

Result: LLINK achieves significant improvements in bilingual retrieval, showing strong model preference over baseline and fine-tuned models, while highlighting reduced tokenization inflation and enhanced cross-lingual alignment.

Conclusion: Treating low-resource languages as a modality provides a practical and lightweight approach for enhancing cross-lingual alignment in LLMs, despite residual shortcomings in numeric fidelity.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need improved quantitative reasoning abilities to assist clinical decision-making, which is underexplored in existing benchmarks.

Method: This paper presents MedCalc-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark, and MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement learning environment for training LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-32B within MedCalc-Env achieved state-of-the-art performance in medical calculations, with marked improvements in accuracy and reasoning.

Conclusion: MedCalc provides a robust framework for testing and improving LLMs in medical calculations, though challenges like multi-condition logic remain.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks
evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking
quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets
like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world
computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical
calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based
(e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar,
Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal
medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more
challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement
learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step
clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this
environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable
gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness.
Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and
contextual understanding.

*Deokhyung Kang,Seonjeong Hwang,Daehui Kim,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and addresses multilingual reasoning gaps in language models caused by failures in understanding multilingual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the causes of the multilingual reasoning gap in language models and identify ways to mitigate it.

Method: Evaluating methods for detecting understanding failures in multilingual inputs, proposing Selective Translation to address them efficiently.

Result: Selective Translation reduces the multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only 20% of inputs.

Conclusion: Understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap, and selective detection/translation can effectively mitigate it, promoting equitable multilingual reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) operate via specialized modules or a unified resource for judgment. It identifies a dominant dimension, the Valence-Assent Axis (VAA), that governs evaluative judgment and influences reasoning, even leading to biases and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address whether judgments in LLMs rely on modular specialization or a unified system of representation. This question is key for understanding systemic biases and reasoning fidelity in artificial intelligence.

Method: The authors analyze diverse LLMs and identify a central axis (Valence-Assent Axis), which jointly encodes subjective valence and factual assent. They use direct interventions to show how this axis influences generative processes and reasoning outcomes.

Result: The study finds that the Valence-Assent Axis is a unified mechanism in LLMs that governs evaluative judgments, impacting reasoning outputs and driving biases such as justification over accuracy.

Conclusion: The Valence-Assent Axis drives the judgment and reasoning process in LLMs, creating systemic issues such as hallucinations and biases, which stem from prioritizing coherent judgments over faithful reasoning.

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

### [60] [TransAlign: Machine Translation Encoders are Strong Word Aligners, Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27337)
*Benedikt Ebing,Christian Goldschmied,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransAlign, a novel word aligner leveraging multilingual machine translation (MT) models for enhanced label projection in token classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-lingual transfer (XLT) faces challenges due to limited training data in most world languages, and the paper aims to improve label projection methods used for translation-based strategies.

Method: The methodology centers around TransAlign, which utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT model to improve word alignment and label projection.

Result: TransAlign achieves superior word alignment (WA) performance compared to existing popular WAs and non-WA-based label projection methods for token classification tasks.

Conclusion: TransAlign is a significant advancement in label projection techniques, providing improved XLT performance and showcasing the utility of multilingual MT model encoders in such tasks.

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label
projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.

TL;DR: This paper presents ThoughtProbe, a framework that uses hidden reasoning features in LLMs to enhance reasoning performance through tree exploration and branch aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the hidden reasoning signals of LLMs as discriminative features for improving reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Utilizing LLMs' hidden representations alongside classifiers to score and prioritize tree node expansion, followed by branch aggregation to identify optimal answers.

Result: ThoughtProbe significantly enhances inference performance across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks by finding valid reasoning chains.

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe improves reasoning performance of LLMs through better exploration and aggregation of reasoning paths, showcasing the potential of hidden features.

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive systematic survey of the application of natural
language processing (NLP) along the entire battery life cycle, instead of one
stage or method, and introduce a novel technical language processing (TLP)
framework for the EU's proposed digital battery passport (DBP) and other

assessed 274 scientific papers before the critical review of the final 66
relevant papers. We publicly provide artifacts of the review for validation and
reproducibility. The findings show that new NLP tasks are emerging in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving neural network architecture for translation tasks by optimizing evaluation metrics beyond BLEU scores.

Method: A multi-objective genetic algorithm with Transformer architecture, using perplexity and BLEU scores as evaluation metrics.

Result: The identified neural networks outperform baseline models, with improved results due to incorporating auxiliary evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating perplexity along with BLEU scores enhances neural architecture search performance and translation model quality.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer
architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for
different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for
neural network structures with better translation results, we considered
perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to
BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the
population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show
that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the

### [64] [Balancing Knowledge Updates: Toward Unified Modular Editing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27400)
*Jiahao Liu,Zijian Wang,Kuo Zhao,Dong Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces IntAttn-Edit, a novel method for efficient knowledge editing in large language models by updating both MLP and attention modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the imbalance in existing knowledge editing methods that primarily focus on MLP modules, neglecting attention (Attn) modules as significant contributors to factual knowledge storage and retrieval.

Method: The authors developed IntAttn-Edit, which uses a knowledge balancing strategy to proportionally update MLP and Attn modules based on their contributions to knowledge storage.

Result: IntAttn-Edit demonstrated superior performance in terms of edit success, generalization, and knowledge preservation compared to existing methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The novel knowledge balancing strategy ensures optimal editing performance across various scenarios by effectively leveraging both MLP and attention modules.

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

*Ashwin Kumar,Yuzi He,Aram H. Markosyan,Bobbie Chern,Imanol Arrieta-Ibarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores biases, specifically prefix bias, in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) reward models and suggests mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and measure biases, particularly prefix bias, in reward models trained on human preference data in reinforcement learning systems.

Method: Developed novel methods to detect and evaluate prefix bias in reward models, analyzed biases across racial and gender dimensions, and proposed a data augmentation strategy for bias mitigation.

Result: Identified significant gender and racial biases in reward models across datasets, demonstrated the persistence of this issue irrespective of model architecture, and showed that data augmentation strategies reduce prefix bias.

Conclusion: Bias-aware dataset design, evaluation, and mitigation are critical for building fair and reliable reward models to enhance fairness in AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tamazight is underrepresented in digital spaces, having limited computational resources and facing data scarcity, prompting the need for community-driven language technology initiatives.

Method: The awaldigital.org platform was launched to gather translation and speech data from native speakers, emphasizing collaboration to contribute resources for Tamazight NLP.

Result: Over 18 months, the platform achieved 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of speech data, but participation primarily came from linguists and activists due to sociolinguistic challenges.

Conclusion: Community crowdsourcing efforts for Tamazight require adaptation due to engagement barriers and linguistic complexities to truly scale and provide substantial language resources.

Abstract: This paper presents Awal, a community-powered initiative for developing
language technology resources for Tamazight. We provide a comprehensive review
of the NLP landscape for Tamazight, examining recent progress in computational
resources, and the emergence of community-driven approaches to address
persistent data scarcity. Launched in 2024, awaldigital.org platform addresses
the underrepresentation of Tamazight in digital spaces through a collaborative
platform enabling speakers to contribute translation and voice data. We analyze
18 months of community engagement, revealing significant barriers to
participation including limited confidence in written Tamazight and ongoing
standardization challenges. Despite widespread positive reception, actual data
contribution remained concentrated among linguists and activists. The modest
scale of community contributions -- 6,421 translation pairs and 3 hours of
speech data -- highlights the limitations of applying standard crowdsourcing
approaches to languages with complex sociolinguistic contexts. We are working
on improved open-source MT models using the collected data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a memory management system using Bayesian-inspired principles to address challenges in memory redundancy and staleness for personalized AI agents. The presented approach improves personalized services by optimizing memory updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in personalized agent systems, such as memory redundancy, staleness, and poor integration, by introducing a more effective memory management system.

Method: The authors employ a Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm leveraging memory entropy to dynamically update memory vectors, reducing global entropy and enhancing personalization.

Result: Experimental results show this system excels in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies confirm its effectiveness in reducing memory bloat.

Conclusion: The proposed system improves personalized services for AI agents and offers new insights into designing long-term memory systems by addressing memory update challenges.

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new
research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized
external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face
challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context
integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during
interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system
designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired
memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent
to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by
minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better
evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a
benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects.
Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance
in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in
alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of
long-term memory systems.

### [68] [VCORE: Variance-Controlled Optimization-based Reweighting for Chain-of-Thought Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27462)
*Xuan Gong,Senmiao Wang,Hanbo Huang,Ruoyu Sun,Shiyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VCORE, a novel framework to enhance reasoning in large language models by addressing limitations in token supervision during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models, which are hindered by the uniform supervision of tokens in long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories, leading to suboptimal generalization in complex tasks.

Method: The proposed method, VCORE (Variance-Controlled Optimization-based REweighting), reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization problem to allocate supervision adaptively across tokens for robust reasoning generalization.

Result: Empirical testing shows that VCORE outperforms other token reweighting methods across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks in mathematical and coding tasks. It demonstrated substantial performance improvements using Qwen3 series and LLaMA-3.1 models.

Conclusion: VCORE not only enhances reasoning in LLMs but also serves as a better initialization step for subsequent reinforcement learning, paving the way for further advancements in model reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient collaborative reasoning framework combining diffusion language models (DLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for improved reasoning task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning task accuracy while reducing the computational overhead caused by the autoregressive generation paradigm in LLMs.

Method: A collaborative reasoning framework where DLMs generate candidate reasoning steps efficiently, and LLMs evaluate their quality.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrated strong performance across diverse benchmarks in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The research shows that integrating DLMs with LLMs delivers promising improvements in reasoning capabilities with reduced computational costs, providing direction for further advancements.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: This study compares GloVe and BERT embeddings with human semantic judgments, highlighting BERT's superior capture of compositional semantics in compound word processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the alignment between computational embeddings and human semantic judgments in English compound word processing.

Method: The study uses psycholinguistic metrics (Lexeme Meaning Dominance and Semantic Transparency) derived from computational embeddings of GloVe and BERT, compared against human data through correlation and regression analyses.

Result: BERT embeddings perform better than GloVe in capturing compositional semantics. Predictability ratings are strong predictors for semantic transparency.

Conclusion: BERT embeddings offer more accurate semantic modeling, advancing computational psycholinguistics by revealing the mechanisms underlying compound word processing.

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses distribution shifts in low-resource language tasks by implementing two distinct causal domain generalization techniques: counterfactual data augmentation and invariant causal representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge that arises due to distributional shifts between training and test data, especially in low-resource environments, and to improve model robustness across domains.

Method: The study explores casual data augmentation (CDA) by generating counterfactual examples for sentimental classification and invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) using the DINER framework in multilingual settings.

Result: Counterfactual data augmentation consistently improves cross-domain accuracy in sentiment classification. DINER enhances out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis with varying gains across languages.

Conclusion: Both approaches demonstrated success in improving robustness to unseen domains, showcasing their potential in addressing distributional shifts in low-resource natural language tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer-based models struggle with scalability for long documents due to their quadratic complexity.

Method: The framework integrates sparse attention to focus on relevant inputs, adaptive spans to adjust attention ranges dynamically, and bilinear attention for modeling complex token interactions.

Result: BiSparse-AAS achieves remarkable ROUGE score improvements: 68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining high performance on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets.

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS addresses computational and scalability challenges with a unified framework, providing practical advancements for text summarization in real-world applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for human-interpretable and generalizable methods to analyze text-to-SQL benchmarks and model performance.

Method: The authors developed SQLSpace as a compact representation derived with little human intervention. They applied SQLSpace to benchmark analysis, model performance evaluation, and targeted query rewriting.

Result: SQLSpace highlighted compositional differences in benchmarks, revealed nuanced performance patterns, and enhanced model performance via corrected query rewriting.

Conclusion: SQLSpace proves to be an effective tool in analyzing benchmarks, understanding model behavior, and improving query processing.

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to develop Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS) for clinical use, utilizing patient and clinician inputs, and evaluates the ability of open-source large language models to achieve human-level performance in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The focus is to shift AI-generated clinical summaries towards patient-centered care by emphasizing patient preferences, values, and concerns, addressing the limitation of existing summaries that focus on biology alone.

Method: The framework included insights from patient/clinician interviews, development of annotation guidelines, gold-standard PCS creation, prompt refinement, and testing open-source LLMs using various evaluation metrics.

Result: Patients prioritized personal, psychosocial, and lifestyle elements, while clinicians preferred concise functional and contextual data. Among LLMs, Mistral-8B and Llama-3.1-8B achieved better performances but human-generated summaries excelled in correctness and patient-centeredness.

Conclusion: The study highlights that while LLMs show promise, they still lag behind human-created PCS in capturing nuanced, patient-centered aspects and encourage further refinement and development in AI summarization methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

*Malik H. Altakrori,Nizar Habash,Abdelhakim Freihat,Younes Samih,Kirill Chirkunov,Muhammed AbuOdeh,Radu Florian,Teresa Lynn,Preslav Nakov,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DialectalArabicMMLU is a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate large language models' performance across five major Arabic dialects, addressing the underrepresentation of these dialects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic dialects are prevalent in daily communication but lack representation in current LLM evaluation benchmarks, which mainly focus on Modern Standard Arabic.

Method: The benchmark adapts and manually translates 3K question-answer pairs into five Arabic dialects, resulting in 15K QA pairs across multiple domains, extending existing frameworks.

Result: Evaluation of 19 open-weight LLMs revealed significant performance variations across dialects and gaps in dialectal generalization.

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU is the first unified resource designed to improve LLM evaluation in Arabic dialects, supporting more inclusive model developments.

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive
evaluation and future model development.

*Yinghao Luo,Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Klaske Vliegenthart Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates improving medical NLP performance in low-resource languages (Dutch, Romanian, Spanish) by using domain-specific further pre-training and highlights the benefits of cross-lingual transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of domain-specific NLP tools for low-resource languages in multilingual healthcare applications and explore how further pre-training on medical domain-specific corpora impacts task performance.

Method: The authors performed four experiments to create medical domain-adapted models through further pre-training. These models were then fine-tuned on three medical NLP tasks: patient screening in Dutch clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian, and Spanish clinical notes.

Result: The results show that domain adaptation significantly improved task performance, particularly when differentiating between clinical and general biomedical domains. The clinical domain-adapted models outperformed the general biomedical models, and evidence of cross-lingual transferability was also found.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation improves medical NLP in low-resource languages. Cross-lingual transferability contributes to performance gains and the study gives meaningful insights for developing multilingual medical NLP systems in low-resource settings.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

### [77] [Data-Efficient Domain Adaptation for LLM-based MT using Contrastive Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27556)
*Inacio Vieira,Antonio Castaldo,James O'Doherty,Sheila Castilho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) for data-efficient domain adaptation of large language models, showing significant performance gains with fewer samples compared to supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain adaptation for LLMs often requires costly supervised fine-tuning, and the paper seeks to introduce a more data-efficient approach.

Method: The method uses CPO by synthesizing preference pairs, treating the model's output as rejected and human-approved data as chosen, to guide adaptation.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that using only 14.7k preference pairs, performance approaches models trained on 160k+ samples via SFT.

Conclusion: CPO is highly effective for domain adaptation in machine translation and other generative tasks, achieving similar results to SFT with reduced data requirements.

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

### [78] [MARAG-R1: Beyond Single Retriever via Reinforcement-Learned Multi-Tool Agentic Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27569)
*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Yuxin Wang,Tingshuo Fan,Yuan Li,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models inherently suffer from factual inaccuracies due to their static pretraining data. MARAG-R1, a multi-tool Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, leverages multiple retrieval mechanisms to dynamically enhance information access, substantially improving corpus-level reasoning tasks' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static nature of pretraining data limits LLMs' factual accuracy and adaptability to new information, creating a bottleneck in retrieval-augmented generation systems, especially for tasks requiring extensive external knowledge.

Method: The paper proposes MARAG-R1, a framework integrating four retrieval tools—semantic search, keyword search, filtering, and aggregation—learned through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experimental results on benchmarks like GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA show MARAG-R1 achieving new state-of-the-art performance in corpus-level reasoning tasks, addressing limitations of single-retriever RAG systems.

Conclusion: MARAG-R1 effectively addresses the static and restrictive aspect of traditional RAG systems by dynamically coordinating multiple retrieval tools, substantially enhancing LLMs' ability in corpus-level synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are
inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual
inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

### [79] [SpecAttn: Speculating Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27641)
*Harsh Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecAttn enhances inference efficiency of LLMs by exploiting draft model computations to identify important tokens, achieving sparse attention and reducing computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational cost of self-attention, especially with large context lengths in LLMs, becomes prohibitive and requires efficient solutions for better scalability.

Method: SpecAttn introduces a training-free method leveraging speculative decoding by reusing draft model attention weights and implementing three techniques: KL divergence layer alignment, sorting-free top-p token selection, and dynamic key-value cache pruning.

Result: SpecAttn reduces key-value cache accesses by over 75% while maintaining output quality with a small perplexity increase of 15.29% on the PG-19 dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SpecAttn demonstrates that speculative execution frameworks can enhance inference efficiency in LLMs, achieving significant computational reductions with minimal impact on output quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

*Caleb Ziems,William Held,Jane Yu,Amir Goldberg,David Grusky,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces "CultureCartography," a collaborative methodology using LLMs to identify gaps in cultural knowledge and fill them interactively with human guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global LLMs require culture-specific knowledge, which is often missing from pre-training. The goal is to identify and fill these knowledge gaps using collaboration between humans and LLMs.

Method: Proposing a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography, where LLMs identify low-confidence knowledge areas and humans refine these gaps interactively in real-time. Implemented as a tool named CultureExplorer.

Result: CultureExplorer effectively identifies missing cultural knowledge in advanced models (e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1) and significantly improves accuracy on cultural benchmarks for Llama-3.1-8B after fine-tuning (+19.2%).

Conclusion: Mixed human-LLM collaboration allows for better identification and enrichment of specific cultural knowledge, improving AI model performance on related tasks.

Abstract: To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific
knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such
knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The
most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define
challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or
users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge
extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,
where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs
steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's
goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.
Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has
low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps
therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model
towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a
tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer
LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces
knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even
with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B
by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

### [81] [Continuous Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27688)
*Chenze Shao,Darren Li,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM introduces a new approach to improve large language models efficiency through continuous next-vector prediction, reducing generative steps and computational cost significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency in current large language models caused by sequential token-by-token generation.

Method: Introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM) using a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress K tokens into a single vector and develop a likelihood-free framework for training and sampling.

Result: CALM achieves comparable performance to strong discrete baselines but at a lower computational cost, providing a promising direction for scalable language models.

Conclusion: Next-vector prediction within CALM presents a scalable and efficient pathway for advancing language models.

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench evaluates visual measurement reading using real-world and synthetic data, exposing challenges for current vision-language models in spatial grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the surprising difficulty current vision-language models face in interpreting measurement gauges accurately.

Method: Created a benchmark, MeasureBench, with real-world and synthesized images, plus a pipeline for procedurally generating gauges and conducting model evaluations.

Result: Leading vision-language models struggle with indicator localization, displaying significant failures in reading measurements accurately due to spatial grounding issues.

Conclusion: MeasureBench reveals fundamental limitations in VLMs' spatial grounding, aiming to inspire advancements in visually grounded numeracy and measurement understanding.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a domain-adaptive framework for automated segmentation in quantitative computed tomography (QCT) images to address domain shift challenges, ensuring reliable cross-institutional applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome domain shift in QCT image analysis caused by differences in scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics across institutions, which hinder automated segmentation models.

Method: The paper employs a domain-adaptive transformer framework based on a 3D TransUNet backbone. The framework includes adversarial alignment using a Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) and statistical alignment with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to tackle domain shifts.

Result: The model was trained and validated on a large dataset containing 1,024 QCT scans from one institution and 384 scans from another, achieving enhanced alignment across institutions and maintaining anatomical detail.

Conclusion: The proposed dual mechanism approach enables scanner-agnostic feature learning, improves prediction reliability, and aids multi-center osteoporosis research while preserving anatomical accuracy.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The research enhances Adaptive Density Control (ADC) in 3D Gaussian Splatting by incorporating directional consistency, leading to fewer primitives and better reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve ADC in 3D Gaussian Splatting by addressing its limitations in structural alignment and redundant primitive splitting.

Method: Incorporating Directional Consistency (DC) into ADC through the analysis of angular coherence of gradients, optimizing both splitting necessity and placement.

Result: The approach reduces the number of primitives by up to 30% and significantly improves reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Directional Consistency-driven Adaptive Density Control (DC4GS) effectively improves both efficiency and fidelity in 3D Gaussian Splatting compared to the conventional ADC.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel training strategy called Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) for lung nodule detection in chest CT, particularly focusing on achieving robust results under data-limited scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges arise in deploying deep learning for lung nodule detection with limited annotated data in clinical settings.

Method: The proposed SACL dynamically adjusts training curriculum design based on data scale by employing adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization.

Result: SACL demonstrated significant performance improvements under data-limited conditions on the LUNA25 dataset, using YOLOv11 as the base detector, achieving up to 4.6% improvement versus baseline methods.

Conclusion: SACL offers a robust and adaptable training solution for scenarios with varying amounts of available data, helping healthcare systems implement lung nodule detection despite limited resources.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid framework for deepfake detection that combines forensic features with deep learning representations, achieving high accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progression of GANs and diffusion models has made synthetic media highly realistic, leading to concerns over misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust, which necessitates more effective deepfake detection methods.

Method: The study proposed a hybrid framework that integrates forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors) with deep learning models like CNNs and ViTs for deepfake detection.

Result: The hybrid model outperformed single-method baselines and existing state-of-the-art hybrid approaches on benchmark deepfake detection datasets, achieving high F1-scores and robustness against distortions and unseen manipulations.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining forensic features with deep learning provide an effective and transparent solution for resilient deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive framework for automated multi-modal brain lesion segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address challenges in clinical neuroimaging, particularly the limitations of current deep learning models that lack generalization and exhibit high performance variance.

Method: The paper proposes SYNAPSE-Net, combining multi-stream CNN encoders, Swin Transformer bottleneck, CMAF mechanism, hierarchical gated decoder, and a variance reduction training strategy.

Result: SYNAPSE-Net demonstrated superior performance: DSC of 0.831 in WMH dataset, best boundary accuracy in ISLES 2022 (HD95 = 9.69), and DSC of 0.8651 for tumor core region in BraTS 2020.

Conclusion: SYNAPSE-Net provides a robust and generalized solution for automated brain lesion segmentation, enhancing clinical feasibility. Code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source

### [88] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SFAT model for generating live video stream comments, emphasizing semantic relevance through frame prioritization and multimodal data integration. It also presents a large-scale English-language dataset from Twitch for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to prioritize semantically relevant video frames for generating contextually appropriate comments. This gap limits viewer engagement and the effectiveness of live commenting systems.

Method: The SFAT model leverages CLIP's multimodal visual-text knowledge to weight video frames based on semantic relevance. It uses a weighted sum technique for prioritization, and the comment decoder integrates cues from video and chats using cross-attention mechanisms.

Result: SFAT effectively generates live video stream comments by focusing on relevant frames and multimodal integration, outperforming existing methods. A novel English Twitch dataset was built for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed SFAT model improves contextually appropriate comment generation by integrating frame prioritization and multimodal context. The English Twitch dataset adds diversity and broader applicability for research in this area.

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores Incremental HOI Detection (IHOID) for dynamic environments through an exemplar-free framework that mitigates forgetting and improves generalization on zero-shot HOIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evolving HOI scenarios in open-world environments, which cannot be handled by conventional models.

Method: The paper proposes the Incremental Relation Distillation (IRD) framework with exemplar-free learning, decoupling object and relation learning, and leveraging unique distillation losses for invariant relation features.

Result: Experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show improved performance in mitigating forgetting, handling interaction drift, and generalizing zero-shot HOIs compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The IRD framework offers an effective solution for IHOID, showcasing the ability to handle dynamic HOI scenarios superior to state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

*Mario Camarena,Het Patel,Fatemeh Nazari,Evangelos Papalexakis,Mohamadhossein Noruzoliaee,Jia Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AD-SAM, an improved vision model for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, surpassing prior methods in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing models for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, which face challenges in handling spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes.

Method: AD-SAM features a dual-encoder (Vision Transformer and CNN-based backbone) and a deformable decoder using multi-stage refinement. It employs hybrid losses to enhance optimization and segmentation performance.

Result: AD-SAM achieves higher accuracy than SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3, with mIoU scores of 68.1 on Cityscapes and 59.5 on BDD100K, demonstrating superior performance, faster learning speed, and higher data efficiency.

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and optimization improvements in foundation models, like AD-SAM, significantly enhance reliable and scalable autonomous driving perception.

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiT, an unsupervised hierarchical neural field for 3D shape representations, enabling flexible and data-driven hierarchical segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that learns general hierarchies of 3D shapes across diverse categories in an unsupervised manner, overcoming limitations of fixed structure hierarchy models.

Method: A hierarchical transformer (HiT) is proposed, which uses a compressed codebook to learn parent-child relationships and infer hierarchical structures directly from data without constraining to fixed binary hierarchies.

Result: HiT achieves effective unsupervised shape segmentation across all 55 ShapeNet categories, demonstrating the ability to segment shapes into multilevel granularities.

Conclusion: The model provides significant advancements in flexible and generalizable learning of hierarchical 3D shape structures, outperforming previous methods in segmentation tasks.

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZEBRA, a zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that reconstructs visual experiences from fMRI data without requiring subject-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject-specific models or fine-tuning methods limit scalability and practical application in neural decoding from fMRI data.

Method: ZEBRA decomposes fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components using adversarial training. It isolates subject-invariant, semantic-specific features to enable generalization to unseen subjects without additional data or retraining.

Result: ZEBRA significantly outperforms other zero-shot baselines and achieves comparable performance to fully fine-tuned models across various metrics.

Conclusion: ZEBRA is an innovative and scalable neural decoding framework, enhancing universal decoding capabilities across subjects without requiring customization.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

*Zhicong Sun,Jacqueline Lo,Jinxing Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WildfireX-SLAM, a synthetic dataset tailored for SLAM research in wildfire and forest environments, addressing the gap in high-quality datasets for large-scale outdoor scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing 3DGS-based SLAM for large-scale forest environments is hindered by the lack of a high-quality, comprehensive dataset, which holds potential for wildfire emergency response and forest management.

Method: The authors leveraged Unreal Engine 5 to create a synthetic dataset with aerial and ground views, ground-truth camera poses, and flexible controls over environmental factors like light and wildfire conditions.

Result: The output is the WildfireX-SLAM dataset, consisting of 5.5k RGB-D aerial images over a 16 km² synthetic forest environment, accompanied by benchmarks showcasing the challenges and opportunities in this field.

Conclusion: The WildfireX-SLAM dataset aids in advancing SLAM research for forest mapping and wildfire management, with tools provided for various environmental controls and future improvements identified.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MMDiT introduces a lightweight multimodal diffusion model with 304M parameters for efficient and high-quality image generation. The model is trained on limited resources and achieves competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image generation often require extensive training data and computational power or suffer from high computational latency due to their complex structure. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The paper introduces E-MMDiT, implementing token reductions through a compressive visual tokenizer and multi-path compression for compact token representation. It also enhances efficiency with mechanisms like Position Reinforcement, Alternating Subregion Attention, and AdaLN-affine modules.

Result: E-MMDiT, with only 304M parameters, achieves a score of 0.66 on GenEval on 512px images, trained with 25M data in 1.5 days on 8 AMD MI300X GPUs. Post-training techniques further improved its score to 0.72.

Conclusion: E-MMDiT sets a new benchmark for efficient image synthesis with minimal resource usage. Its efficient architecture and competitive results highlight its potential in democratizing generative AI research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

*Xingtao Ling Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CVCAM and MHSAM to improve cross-view object geo-localization by enabling better feature exchange and representation while addressing challenges such as edge noise. Additionally, it provides a new dataset, G2D, for the 'Ground-to-Drone' localization task, and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object geo-localization that suffers from ineffective cross-view information transfer, spatial feature refinement issues, and noise interference affecting localization accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes CVCAM for iterative cross-view interaction and MHSAM for multi-scale spatial feature extraction. It also introduces the G2D dataset for 'Ground-to-Drone' localization tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrated superior localization accuracy of the proposed approach, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods on the CVOGL and G2D datasets.

Conclusion: CVCAM and MHSAM enhance cross-view object geo-localization by addressing spatial dependencies and edge noise, facilitating more accurate and robust localization. Additionally, G2D enriches existing datasets for 'Ground-to-Drone' tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiGS, a hierarchical framework for generating 3D scenes iteratively with user input and peripheral area generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in balancing scene complexity with minimal user input in 3D scene generation.

Method: The authors propose HiGS, supported by PHiSSG, to enable multi-step associative semantic and spatial composition, ensuring spatial and semantic consistency through recursive optimization.

Result: HiGS achieves better layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference compared to single-stage methods.

Conclusion: HiGS provides a controllable and extensible approach to 3D scene generation, offering enhanced user interaction and efficient scene construction.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFM-Net integrates CNNs for local textures and a novel Mamba branch for global modeling to address remote sensing image classification efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics in remote sensing images make scene classification challenging.

Method: AFM-Net employs two pathways: hierarchical visual priors with CNNs and efficient global sequence modeling using a Mamba branch. It fuses features dynamically using a Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism and routes them adaptively for fine-grained scene recognition.

Result: AFM-Net achieves accuracy rates of 93.72% (AID), 95.54% (NWPU-RESISC45), and 96.92% (UC Merced), outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The AFM-Net efficiently integrates local and global feature modeling, achieving remarkable accuracy with balanced performance and computational efficiency for remote sensing classification challenges.

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

TL;DR: This study examines the use of deep learning models to replicate the Banff Classification for renal transplant biopsies and finds both successes and limitations in current AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of semi-quantitative, complex, and subjective evaluation methods in the Banff Classification for renal transplant biopsies, seeking computational approaches for accurate grading.

Method: A modular, rule-based framework was developed to map deep learning model outputs to Banff lesion scores, decomposing Banff indicators into components and aligning them with expert guidelines for evaluation.

Result: The study found both partial successes in aligning deep learning outputs with expert annotations and critical failure modes, including omissions, hallucinations, and detection ambiguities.

Conclusion: Current AI models show potential but are not yet sufficient for expert-level grading of renal biopsies, emphasizing the need for modular evaluation and a computational grading standard to guide advancements.

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline to create detailed captions for high-resolution images using combined methods from vision-language models, large language models, and object detection systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models often lack the ability to generate detailed captions for high-resolution images due to pre-training on low-resolution inputs, leading to loss of visual details and omitted objects.

Method: The method involves a multi-stage process: generating initial captions using a VLM, identifying key objects with LLMs, predicting co-occurring objects, verifying predictions with object detection systems, and performing focused, region-specific captioning for newly detected objects.

Result: The proposed method produces detailed and reliable image captions, significantly reducing hallucinations in descriptions, as evidenced by quantitative evaluations and hallucination detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating vision-language models with large language models and object detection systems improves caption accuracy and detail for high-resolution images while minimizing hallucinations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

TL;DR: This paper introduces M³Detection, a framework for multi-frame 3D object detection, combining data from camera and 4D imaging radar to improve spatiotemporal feature fusion and enable state-of-the-art detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in existing single-frame camera-radar fusion methods, which struggle with incomplete scene information, image degradation, and radar sparsity, and explores how multi-frame fusion can offer enhanced perception but faces challenges in feature fusion and computational efficiency.

Method: M³Detection conducts multi-level feature fusion on multi-frame data from cameras and 4D imaging radar by integrating object trajectories from a tracker, global inter-object feature aggregation, local inter-grid feature expansion, and multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning.

Result: Experiments on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that M³Detection achieves superior performance in 3D detection tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: M³Detection demonstrates the value of multi-frame camera-4D imaging radar fusion in 3D detection tasks, improving both computational efficiency and detection accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

### [103] [DANCER: Dance ANimation via Condition Enhancement and Rendering with diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27169)
*Yucheng Xing,Jinxing Yin,Xiaodong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DANCER, a diffusion model-based framework for realistic single-person dance video generation with innovative modules to enhance appearance and pose guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in generating realistic dance videos using video diffusion models, which need high-quality generation and continuity, especially for human motions with high degrees of freedom.

Method: The framework incorporates an Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) for detailed reference image processing and a Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to extend motion guidance. Additionally, it uses a newly collected dataset, TikTok-3K, for training.

Result: Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets show DANCER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dance video generation.

Conclusion: DANCER enhances video diffusion models for realistic dance synthesis while maintaining video continuity and quality, providing open datasets and codes for further research after acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

*Mingyu Sung,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces H2-Cache, a hierarchical caching mechanism to accelerate diffusion models with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational costs due to their iterative denoising process, making practical deployment challenging.

Method: A hierarchical caching mechanism leveraging a dual-threshold system that separates denoising into structure-defining and detail-refining stages, paired with Pooled Feature Summarization (PFS) for efficient similarity estimation.

Result: H2-Cache achieves up to 5.08x acceleration while maintaining image quality nearly identical to the baseline, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: H2-Cache effectively tackles the speed-quality trade-off in diffusion models, lowering computational barriers for real-world applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

### [105] [SilhouetteTell: Practical Video Identification Leveraging Blurred Recordings of Video Subtitles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27179)
*Guanchong Huang,Song Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SilhouetteTell, a new video identification attack method that utilizes subtitle silhouette information to predict videos watched silently and even at a distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video identification can expose private user views and habits, possibly leading to cyberbullying, privacy breaches, and discrimination. Existing methods depend on analyzing network traffic; hence, a non-network-based method was needed.

Method: The authors leveraged the spatial shape and timing (temporal difference) between subtitle silhouettes captured on videos to correlate them with subtitle files for video identification. They used smartphones for this process.

Result: Experimental evaluations showed SilhouetteTell to be highly effective, accurately identifying videos from distances up to 40 meters.

Conclusion: Subtitle-based video identification exploits both spatial and temporal information, posing significant risks to privacy even without accessing network traffic. This highlights the need for better video privacy safeguards.

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

*Guozheng Zheng,Jian Guan,Mingjie Xie,Xuanjia Zhao,Congyi Fan,Shiheng Zhang,Pengming Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery by proposing a dual-level progressive hardness-aware reweighting strategy (DPHR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to overcome challenges posed by severe viewpoint gaps and hard negatives in cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery.

Method: Introduces DPHR with two components: Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware module for sample-level weighting and Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting mechanism for batch-level refinement during training.

Result: DPHR demonstrates improved performance and robustness on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DPHR effectively addresses noisy gradients and unstable convergence during cross-view geo-localization, leading to consistent advancements in accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

### [107] [Sparse Model Inversion: Efficient Inversion of Vision Transformers for Data-Free Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27186)
*Zixuan Hu,Yongxian Wei,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Lei Li,Chun Yuan,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles inefficiencies in model inversion for high-resolution images using Vision Transformers by introducing a sparse inversion strategy that focuses on semantic foregrounds, offering faster performance with enhanced utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense model inversion methods suffer from inefficiency due to reconstructing entire image areas, including noisy backgrounds and spurious correlations. This is particularly problematic in high-resolution image inversion.

Method: The authors propose a sparse model inversion (SMI) strategy that selectively focuses on inverting semantic foreground regions and avoids reconstruction of noisy backgrounds and spurious correlations. This approach can be applied as an extension without altering existing loss functions.

Result: The proposed SMI approach accelerates inversion by up to 3.79x while maintaining or enhancing downstream tasks like data-free model quantization and knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: Sparse inversion significantly improves inversion efficiency and utility, making it a promising addition to current methods. The method can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks with minimal adjustments.

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

*John Won,Kyungmin Lee,Huiwon Jang,Dongyoung Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUST, a framework enhancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model performances by efficiently addressing modality conflicts via a dual-stream multimodal transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve robotic policy learning in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by addressing challenges in jointly predicting next-state observations and actions.

Method: Proposes the Dual-Stream Diffusion Transformer (DUST) for separating and coordinating vision and action modalities. Utilizes independent noise perturbations and decoupled flow-matching loss for bidirectional joint distribution learning.

Result: DUST achieves up to 6% enhancement over baselines in simulated benchmarks, and a 13% improvement in real-world robotic tasks. Test-time scaling adds a further 2-5% boost.

Conclusion: DUST effectively resolves modality mismatches in VLAs, improves task performance significantly, and shows promise for large-scale pretraining using action-free videos.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

*Caixin Kang,Yifei Huang,Liangyang Ouyang,Mingfang Zhang,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of automatic deception detection in conversations using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by introducing a new task and dataset based on the social game Werewolf.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance AI systems with robust social intelligence, particularly in discerning truth from deception, which is vital in human interactions.

Method: A new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and a dataset from Werewolf game including synchronized video, text, and ground-truth labels were created for evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, were tested and showed significant performance gaps in reliably distinguishing truth from falsehood.

Conclusion: MLLMs struggle to integrate visual social cues and textual data for deception detection, mandating novel strategies for creating more socially adept AI systems.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

*Jiaxin Zhang,Zehong Zhu,Junye Deng,Yunqin Li,and Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model to analyze village spatial morphology efficiently using multimodal data, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and fusion capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of urbanization leading to spatial homogenization in villages and the limitations of single-disciplinary qualitative analysis methods due to lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data.

Method: The paper proposes an HGNN model combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It uses input and communication nodes, static and dynamic edges, and a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, it introduces a relational pooling mechanism and joint training strategy across 17 subtypes for morphologic analysis.

Result: The HGNN model demonstrated superior performance, significantly enhancing mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 to 0.82/0.90, showing a notable gain for parcel classification tasks by 6% and improving multimodal fusion and classification capabilities.

Conclusion: The method provides robust scientific evidence for exploring spatial patterns and generative logic in villages, addressing research limitations and surpassing previous analysis methods.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for multi-window chest CT images to ensure data privacy and overcome domain shift challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving robust and generalizable models for medical image diagnosis is difficult due to limited annotated datasets and domain shifts. In chest CT, domain shifts stem from differing window settings catering to specific clinical needs.

Method: The method incorporates continual pretraining on unlabeled images with a latent replay-based mechanism, mitigating catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts and ensures data privacy. It also includes a feature distillation approach combining Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE).

Result: The proposed method successfully learns domain-shift-robust representations on chest CT images from two different window settings, outperforming other approaches.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in privacy and domain shifts, achieving superior results in medical image analysis.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecAware introduces a novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model addressing multi-sensor learning challenges in HSI mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of hyperspectral imaging models that struggle with multi-sensor training and overlook sensor meta-attributes, aiming for improved generalizability.

Method: Developed SpecAware, with a meta-content aware module and HyperEmbedding module for adaptive encoding, combined with the newly constructed Hyper-400K benchmark dataset.

Result: Demonstrated high performance across six datasets in tasks like land-cover segmentation, classification, and change detection.

Conclusion: SpecAware provides a unified framework for multi-sensor HSI mapping, enhancing transferability and versatility in hyperspectral imaging applications.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

Abstract: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are
critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering
actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling up models improves performance, but further scaling in 3D geometry reconstruction is challenging due to complex geometric supervision and diverse data.

Method: They propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to route features dynamically to task-specific experts, include a confidence-based depth refinement module, and utilize tailored loss functions.

Result: MoRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and supports efficient downstream applications without extra computation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively scales and adapts 3D models for diverse and robust applications, advancing performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the

3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

Result: Evaluations on RetargetMe benchmark showcase Object-IR's state-of-the-art performance, achieving better quantitative and visual quality, with fast real-time processing.

Conclusion: The self-supervised Object-IR framework offers an efficient and improved methodology for image retargeting, eliminating the need for annotated datasets and providing high performance in preserving object and geometric integrity.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FuseCPath, a framework to effectively fuse heterogeneous foundational models (FMs) in whole slide image (WSI) analysis for computational pathology, delivering superior ensemble performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundational models (FMs) show significant variability due to differences in training datasets and network architectures, leading to inconsistent performance in downstream tasks.

Method: The proposed FuseCPath includes three main components: multi-view clustering for filtering discriminative patches, cluster-level re-embedding for fusing patch-level FMs, and collaborative distillation for fusing slide-level FMs.

Result: FuseCPath demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks using datasets for lung, bladder, and colorectal cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Conclusion: FuseCPath effectively harnesses the strengths of multiple heterogeneous pathological foundational models to achieve superior performance in computational pathology applications.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

*Alik Pramanick,Mayank Bansal,Utkarsh Srivastava,Suklav Ghosh,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using two-phase training and a novel denoising strategy incorporating spatial and frequency domain techniques to defend deep neural networks against adversarial attacks, significantly improving classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their reliability in security-critical applications.

Method: The two-phase method involves training a denoising network integrating spatial and frequency domain strategies (using Discrete Wavelet Transform and transformers), followed by retraining the classifier with denoised images.

Result: The proposed approach boosts classification accuracy effectively against adversarial attacks across datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST.

Conclusion: The denoising strategy coupled with retraining enhances the robustness of deep neural networks, highlighting its potential in combating adversarial vulnerabilities.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method using contrastive learning to improve deep neural network robustness against adversarial attacks by training with clean and perturbed images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep neural networks, causing incorrect predictions with minor image perturbations, thus challenging robust system deployment.

Method: Contrastive learning is employed in conjunction with a contrastive loss function, training using clean and adversarial images to enhance model robustness and improve feature resilience.

Result: Experimental findings demonstrate substantial improvements in defending against various adversarial perturbations, showing the effectiveness of contrastive learning in enhancing feature robustness.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning is effective for adversarial defense, providing more robust and informative feature extraction, advancing the field of deep-learning adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

*Yehna Kim andYoung-Eun Kim,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances Vision-Language Models by using web-crawled descriptions and a spatio-temporal interaction module, resulting in improved zero-shot action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models struggle in zero-shot action recognition due to the reliance on action classes alone, which can cause semantic ambiguities, especially with multi-semantic words.

Method: The proposed approach employs web-crawled descriptions processed by a large-language model to extract relevant keywords, reducing the need for human annotation. Additionally, it introduces a spatio-temporal interaction module to align descriptions with video content.

Result: The model achieves notable zero-shot accuracies of 81.0% on UCF-101, 53.1% on HMDB-51, and 68.9% on Kinetics-600, demonstrating improved performance and adaptability.

Conclusion: The approach reduces dependency on manual annotations and enhances the semantic understanding and alignment of Vision-Language Models, making them more effective for zero-shot action recognition across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the
model's adaptability and effectiveness across various downstream tasks.

*Yinglu Li,Zhiying Lu,Zhihang Liu,Chuanbin Liu,Hongtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG shifts retrieval focus from the document level to region-level, improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency for multi-modal RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RAG methods retrieve entire visual documents, leading to irrelevant and redundant content that reduces model efficiency and performance.

Method: RegionRAG employs a hybrid supervision strategy during training to identify relevant regions and a dynamic grouping pipeline during inference to assemble semantic regions from salient patches.

Result: RegionRAG achieves a 10.02% improvement in retrieval accuracy (R@1) and a 3.56% increase in question answering accuracy, while using fewer visual tokens (71.42%) compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: RegionRAG enhances retrieval accuracy and question answering efficiency by introducing region-level retrieval, reducing irrelevant contextual distractions and focusing on concise, relevant content.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

*Raza Imam,Hu Wang,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces T^3 and T^3_B, frameworks which adaptively merge vision-language models for improved accuracy and reliability in medical imaging, addressing modality-specific challenges and improving over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to resolve the duality in medical imaging models: pretrained networks lack modality-specific features while fine-tuned models struggle with modality shift.

Method: The paper proposes Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), an approach using Jensen-Shannon divergence for dynamic model interpolation on a per-sample basis. For efficiency, T^3_B extends this method for batch-wise computation.

Result: T^3 consistently improves Top-1 accuracy and reduces error in diverse medical imaging modalities, outperforming baselines. The approach is validated across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: This framework facilitates adaptive use of vision-language models in clinical settings, balancing precision and robustness while ensuring computational efficiency.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperClick introduces a framework for enhancing GUI agents by focusing on accurate grounding and confidence calibration for user command execution in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues in GUI agents where overconfidence and unreliable predictions arise due to misalignment between confidence and accuracy, leading to task failures.

Method: The proposed HyperClick framework employs a dual reward mechanism involving binary correctness and spatial confidence modeling through truncated Gaussian distributions calibrated with the Brier score.

Result: HyperClick demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on seven benchmarks and produces calibrated confidence, reducing task failures in GUI automation.

Conclusion: HyperClick improves reliability in GUI grounding by introducing calibrated confidence and self-critical evaluation, setting a new standard for autonomous GUI agent performance.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

### [123] [FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280)
*Zirui Zhu,Hailun Xu,Yang Luo,Yong Liu,Kanchan Sarkar,Zhenheng Yang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free keyframe selection module, FOCUS, that improves efficiency and accuracy for multimodal language models processing long videos by selecting the most relevant video frames under token budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is addressing the challenges of scaling multimodal large language models from single images to long videos, where token budgets and inference costs become prohibitively high while attempting to maintain accuracy.

Method: The proposed method, FOCUS, is a frame selection module utilizing a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) framework from multi-armed bandits to select query-relevant frames. It combines empirical means and a confidence radius for choosing the most informative frames by identifying high-value temporal regions first and then selecting specific frames based on scores.

Result: FOCUS demonstrates substantial accuracy improvements on two long-video question-answering benchmarks, processing only 2% of video frames. On videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% accuracy improvement on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides a model-agnostic, training-free solution for efficient and accurate long video analysis in multimodal large language models, significantly reducing the token budget while maximizing informative frame selection.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Concept erasure in diffusion models aims to unlearn undesirable content to minimize sensitive outputs. The study introduces S-GRACE, a semantics-guided method to efficiently improve erasure and preserve non-target concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers aim to reduce risks associated with sensitive content generation in diffusion models. Existing methods are limited due to neglecting conceptual semantics, leading to insufficient mitigation of sensitive content.

Method: S-GRACE employs semantics guidance within the concept space to generate better-fitted adversarial samples. It integrates these samples in erasure training to improve sensitivity reduction.

Result: S-GRACE achieves a 26% improvement in erasure performance, better preserves unrelated concepts, and reduces training time by 90%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic guidance in concept erasure significantly enhances performance in diffusion models, addressing issues in adversarial techniques and improving efficiency.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy through medical image super-resolution while addressing challenges in long-range anatomical structure modeling and fine-grained frequency details with minimal computational load.

Method: The paper proposes FGMamba with two innovations: 1) GASM integrates efficient state-space modeling with spatial and channel attention, and 2) PFFM leverages FFT-guided fusion for high-frequency detail enhancement across resolutions.

Result: FGMamba demonstrates superior PSNR/SSIM metrics across five medical imaging modalities (Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, Endoscopic) and maintains a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M), outperforming CNN- and Transformer-based methods.

Conclusion: The study establishes that frequency-aware state-space modeling is effective for scalable and accurate medical image super-resolution, making it a compelling tool for medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate

TL;DR: This study introduces CASR-Net, an enhanced pipeline for coronary artery segmentation that significantly improves accuracy in clinical diagnosis through advanced preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of CAD is vital for reducing mortality and aiding effective treatment planning. Current angiographic methods face challenges due to poor image quality, necessitating improved segmentation techniques.

Method: CASR-Net employs a three-stage pipeline: multichannel preprocessing (combining CLAHE and Ben Graham methods), a segmentation network using a DenseNet121-based UNet with Self-ONN decoder, and a contour refinement module.

Result: CASR-Net achieved impressive results with IoU of 61.43%, DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36% after being evaluated on two public datasets using 5-fold cross-validation. It outperformed state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CASR-Net offers a robust and effective solution for automated coronary artery segmentation, assisting clinicians in improving CAD diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD), tackling the challenge of knowledge consolidation across tasks in IOD with adaptive and constrained updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incremental object detection faces challenges like the co-occurrence of unlabeled objects and catastrophic forgetting from previous tasks in detection scenarios.

Method: The paper uses parameterized prompts employing neural networks to adaptively consolidate task knowledge and introduces a fusion strategy to constrain updates.

Result: Experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets show that P$^2$IOD achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses knowledge retention and adaptation issues in IOD, marking an advancement in model performance for incremental detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

*Wenfeng Huang,Xiangyun Liao,Yinling Qian,Hao Liu,Yongming Yang,Wenjing Jia,Qiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGS, a framework for improving surgical tissue visualization and reconstruction using adaptive techniques to address challenges in deformable tissue movement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance visualization quality and reconstruction efficiency of dynamic tissues in robot-assisted surgery that are impacted by movement causing artifacts and aliasing.

Method: Proposed SAGS, a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting approach, with an attention-driven 4D deformation decoder, leveraging smoothing and Mip filters for better detail and less artifact disruption.

Result: SAGS outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks across metrics PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, delivering improved visualization quality.

Conclusion: The SAGS framework successfully addresses aliasing and artifacts in deformable tissue reconstruction and sets a new standard for visualization in surgical robotics.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

*Weiming Chen,Yijia Wang,Zhihan Zhu,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper tackles ultra-low bit rate visual communication by integrating image generation with deep image compression to achieve high-quality reconstruction and analysis accuracy in challenging, limited-bandwidth scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of effective visual communication and analysis in bandwidth-constrained scenarios, such as deep space exploration and battlefield conditions, where current coding methods fail to provide efficient solutions.

Method: The authors combine semantic text descriptions and coding latent, integrating them into a rectified flow model, achieving accurate image reconstruction with deep compression while transmitting data at ultra-low bit rates.

Result: Their method demonstrates comparable image quality and vision analysis performance to existing techniques but with significantly reduced bandwidth usage.

Conclusion: The proposed technique enables efficient and precise visual scene reconstruction and analysis in low-bandwidth scenarios, advancing communication for applications like remote analysis and human interactions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the significance of robust methods for breast cancer detection, sharing a clinically relevant solution to contribute to large-scale screening improvements.

Abstract: The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast

*Yijia Wang,Yiqing Shen,Weiming Chen,Zhihai He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method called CIELR for complex image editing by converting user instructions into simpler editing actions, avoiding joint fine-tuning of language and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods struggle with complex editing instructions due to the need for computationally expensive fine-tuning of large models.

Method: CIELR employs structured semantic representation using foundation models and iterative refinement to perform complex image editing tasks without joint fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments show CIELR significantly outperforms previous methods in maintaining consistency and is demonstrated on a new benchmark, CIEBench.

Conclusion: CIELR provides an efficient approach for complex image editing, achieving superior performance while reducing computational costs, along with the introduction of a new dataset and benchmark.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RzenEmbed, a unified framework for creating embeddings across diverse modalities, outperforming prior methods in video and visual document retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus mainly on natural images and lack effective handling of videos and visual documents in retrieval tasks.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage training strategy: foundational multimodal retrieval in the first stage, and an improved InfoNCE loss with prioritization of challenging samples and mitigation of false negatives in the second stage.

Result: RzenEmbed achieves state-of-the-art results on the MMEB benchmark, performing best in video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RzenEmbed significantly advances multimodal retrieval capabilities and demonstrates its efficacy across multiple modalities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available
in https://huggingface.co/qihoo360/RzenEmbed.

*Kenneth Yang,Wen-Li Wei,Jen-Chun Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Feedforward-based Parameter Selection (FPS), a memory-efficient approach to fine-tune large-scale pre-trained models without the need for gradients, outperforming state-of-the-art memory efficiency and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches either increase inference latency or retain high memory usage due to full backward passes. This motivates the need for a strategy that combines efficiency, simplicity, and practicality.

Method: FPS selects an optimal parameter subset without gradients, utilizing a parameter ranking based on the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations during a single forward pass.

Result: On 24 visual tasks, FPS matches state-of-the-art performance while achieving 9x lower peak memory usage and 2x faster parameter selection.

Conclusion: FPS demonstrates a practical, memory-efficient solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. It balances performance, resource efficiency, and implementation simplicity.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for adapting video diffusion transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes from small datasets, achieving domain transfer efficiently and producing high-quality, stable sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient fine-tuning of video diffusion models for diverse cinematic domains using small datasets, addressing the challenges in visual style and motion complexity.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) Fine-tuning visual style with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and (2) Generating coherent video sequences with a video decoder while employing parallelization and partitioning strategies.

Result: The pipeline demonstrated improvements in cinematic fidelity, temporal stability, and stylistic consistency, supported by quantitative metrics and expert user study.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully adapts video diffusion transformers for cinematic production, offering reproducible methods and practical advancements in video synthesis.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

*Wu Wei,Xiaomeng Fan,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Pengxiang Li,Yunde Jia,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called Alignment across Trees to improve modality alignment in vision-language models by creating hierarchical tree-like features for images and texts, aligning them through hyperbolic manifolds for better integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models face challenges in effectively aligning hierarchical text features with image features, as images are represented by single features which causes asymmetry and limits integration.

Method: The method constructs tree-like hierarchical features for both modalities. It utilizes semantic-aware visual feature extraction with cross-attention driven by text and projects these features into hyperbolic manifolds of differing curvatures, aligning them through a KL distance measure and minimizing this distance by an optimal intermediate manifold.

Result: Experiments on open-set taxonomic classification tasks across multiple image datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method compared to strong baselines under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves modality alignment in VLMs, proving its effectiveness for tasks requiring hierarchical representation and alignment, and consistently outperforms existing methods under challenging settings.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study audits fairness in tumor segmentation datasets focusing on age, ethnicity, and data source bias, revealing intrinsic age biases and site-specific ethnic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked fairness evaluation in segmentation tasks in deep learning healthcare systems and prevent disparities in care.

Method: The authors conducted an audit on segmentation labels in the MAMA-MIA breast cancer dataset and analyzed segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source.

Result: They found intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients and site-specific ethnic biases when aggregating data from multiple sources.

Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of granular analysis to mitigate biases in segmentation datasets and ensure fairness across populations.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) by developing techniques to preserve semantic relationships in text and disentangle hierarchical video representations, enhancing retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address semantic collapse issues in text and video embeddings in PRVR, where diverse events within videos are poorly handled by existing methods.

Method: The paper introduces Text Correlation Preservation Learning to maintain semantic relationships in text queries and proposes Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA) with additional adaptive techniques to improve video embedding alignment.

Result: The proposed framework prevents semantic collapse and significantly enhances retrieval performance, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: This paper provides an effective solution to mitigate semantic collapse in PRVR, improving the handling of diverse video content for better video retrieval accuracy.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DeblurSDI, a self-supervised, zero-shot framework for blind image deconvolution, which uses a reverse self-diffusion process and does not rely on prior training or external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging inverse problem as both the latent sharp image and blur kernel are unknown. Traditional methods rely heavily on priors or large training datasets, limiting adaptability to real-world variations.

Method: DeblurSDI uses a reverse self-diffusion process beginning with noise, iteratively refining the solution through two random neural networks guided by a data consistency objective and L1-norm sparsity for the kernel. It incorporates a noise scheduling mechanism for stabilization.

Result: DeblurSDI demonstrates superior performance in recovering both sharp images and blur kernels, even under highly degraded conditions, as shown by extensive experimental validation.

Conclusion: The study concludes that DeblurSDI's self-diffusion approach and dynamic, instance-specific priors provide robust, accurate blind deconvolution without relying on traditional pre-training or external datasets.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: The redesign of Vision Transformers, as exemplified by CoMViT, can yield efficient and interpretable models suitable for medical imaging in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VisPainter, a modular framework for scientific illustrations that provide element-level control and post-editability, paired with VisBench for systematic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models fail to provide both high information density and intuitive editability for scientific illustrations, limiting efficiency and flexibility.

Method: The paper proposes VisPainter, a multi-agent system consisting of Manager, Designer, and Toolbox modules to collaboratively create editable vector graphics. It also introduces VisBench as a benchmark with seven evaluation metrics.

Result: VisPainter enables element-level manipulation and edits of scientific illustrations. Extensive experiments validate its architecture and reliability, ranking vision-language models and analyzing their capabilities.

Conclusion: VisPainter and VisBench close the gap in scientific illustration tools, fulfilling the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iteration in creation and evaluation.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework to improve school mapping accuracy by combining machine learning, satellite imagery, and human validation, focusing on developing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and updated records of educational facilities are often lacking in developing regions, posing challenges for planning and resource allocation.

Method: The framework employs a machine learning analysis of population density, land cover, and infrastructure, alongside satellite imagery and deep learning models, coupled with a human-in-the-loop interactive validation interface.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show that the approach is scalable, cost-effective, and successfully improves the process of mapping educational infrastructure.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the accessibility and reliability of school location data, offering a practical solution for better educational planning in underserved areas.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Motivation: Deepfakes generated by advanced generative models pose significant threats, and current audiovisual deepfake detection methods struggle to generalize to unknown manipulations.

Method: Referee leverages one-shot speaker-specific identity cues and aligns identity-related queries between reference and target content into cross-modal features, focusing on audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on datasets such as FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate Referee's state-of-the-art effectiveness in cross-dataset and cross-language scenarios.

Conclusion: Cross-modal identity verification is emphasized as critical for advancing future deepfake detection methods, with Referee showcasing enhanced detection performance.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal

which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data
and models are available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/NAUTILUS.

### [144] [Towards Universal Video Retrieval: Generalizing Video Embedding via Synthesized Multimodal Pyramid Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27571)
*Zhuoning Guo,Mingxin Li,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Xiaowen Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in current video retrieval methods and introduces a novel framework that includes a new universal benchmark, scalable data synthesis, and an advanced training curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval models are limited because they rely on narrow benchmarks and single-task training, which restricts their ability to generalize across multiple dimensions.

Method: The authors propose the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a set of 16 datasets for diagnostic evaluation. They also generate 1.55 million high-quality data pairs and create a training curriculum using a Modality Pyramid to develop a General Video Embedder (GVE).

Result: The General Video Embedder (GVE) achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on their newly introduced universal benchmark, UVRB. The analysis shows traditional benchmarks fail to predict generalization effectively and identify issues in partially relevant retrieval scenarios.

Conclusion: This framework enhances the generalization capabilities of video retrieval systems and provides a structured approach to achieving universal video retrieval, moving beyond the limitations of existing models.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

*Jiawei Gu,Yunzhuo Hao,Huichen Will Wang,Linjie Li,Michael Qizhe Shieh,Yejin Choi,Ranjay Krishna,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThinkMorph is a multimodal reasoning model that iteratively combines language and vision to improve understanding, showcasing significant performance on benchmarks and emergent reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance multimodal reasoning by meaningful integration of language and vision, enabling complementary reasoning across modalities.

Method: Developed ThinkMorph, a unified model fine-tuned on high-quality, interleaved text-image reasoning traces across diverse tasks.

Result: ThinkMorph achieves significant performance improvements (34.7% on vision-centric benchmarks), generalizes to out-of-domain tasks, and demonstrates novel multimodal reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Unified multimodal models like ThinkMorph display emergent intelligence and open new avenues for understanding multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

### [147] [Deep Neural Watermarking for Robust Copyright Protection in 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27533)
*Khandoker Ashik Uz Zaman,Mohammad Zahangir Alam,Mohammed N. M. Ali,Mahdi H. Miraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep neural watermarking framework for 3D point clouds using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and PointNet++ to protect intellectual property against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing use of 3D content, traditional watermarking methods fail due to 3D point clouds' vulnerability to geometric and non-geometric distortions.

Method: The method embeds binary watermarks using SVD in 3D point clouds and employs PointNet++ for robust extraction after various data attacks.

Result: Experimental results show that this approach outperforms traditional SVD methods, achieving higher accuracy (0.83) and IoU (0.80) even under severe attacks like cropping.

Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based framework ensures robust copyright protection and reliable watermark recovery for 3D content under challenging geometric distortions.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

*Xue Xia,Randall Balestriero,Tao Zhang,Yixin Zhou,Andrew Ding,Dev Saini,Lorenz Hurni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapSAM2 is a novel framework that automates the segmentation and linking of historical map images across time series using few-shot fine-tuning and pseudo time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of annotated training data and the stylistic variability of historical maps make their automated analysis challenging and time-intensive, especially for creating linked spatio-temporal datasets.

Method: MapSAM2 uses a visual foundation model with few-shot fine-tuning and treats historical maps and time series as videos. This approach incorporates contextual cues via memory attention for improved accuracy and includes pseudo time series generation to reduce annotation costs.

Result: MapSAM2 successfully learns temporal associations, accurately segments, and links buildings in historical map time series with limited supervision or pseudo videos.

Conclusion: MapSAM2 enhances historical map image analysis with improved segmentation and time series linking, and its dataset and code will be released for further research.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Hervé Goëau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple and unified hashing framework for efficient large-scale retrieval by enforcing cross-view binary code alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the computational challenges of large-scale retrieval in high-dimensional spaces using foundation models while presenting a simpler, faster alternative to complex binary code generation methods.

Method: CroVCA uses a binary cross-entropy loss for alignment and a coding-rate maximization as regularization. It proposes HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with batch normalization to ensure balanced codes.

Result: CroVCA demonstrates state-of-the-art results across benchmarks, achieving high efficiency in training and runtime, with tasks like hashing completed in minutes on a single GPU.

Conclusion: The CroVCA framework is efficient, adaptable, and applicable across various retrieval tasks, offering both simplicity and performance in hashing-based approaches.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

### [150] [ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599)
*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks by proposing ANCHOR, a contrastive learning framework for improved robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks' reliance on gradients for learning makes them vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which exploit this feature to manipulate model predictions.

Method: The paper introduces ANCHOR, which combines adversarial training with supervised contrastive learning and hard positive mining to align embeddings of images and their perturbations.

Result: ANCHOR demonstrates high performance on CIFAR-10, achieving superior clean and robust accuracy under adversarial attacks (PGD-20).

Conclusion: Using supervised contrastive learning with adversarial guidance leads to more robust and structured model representations, effectively balancing accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FRIDA, a framework using pre-trained diffusion model features for improved detection and attribution of fake images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over synthetic image authenticity and the limitations of existing detectors to generalize across unseen generators.

Method: Utilizes activations from pre-trained diffusion models combined with k-nearest-neighbor classification and a lightweight neural model for analysis.

Result: FRIDA achieves superior cross-generator detection and accurate source attribution of synthetic images without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Diffusion model representations inherently encode generator-specific signatures, demonstrating potential for effective synthetic image forensics.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features
Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a
pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator
attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,
while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results
show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific
patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image
forensics.

*Yuhong Liu,Beichen Zhang,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Long Xing,Xiaoyi Dong,Haodong Duan,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised reinforcement learning paradigm for improving spatial understanding in large vision-language models (LVLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance spatial understanding in LVLMs without relying on expensive and limited supervised fine-tuning processes or specialized tools.

Method: The method involves using Spatial-SSRL, which implements five self-supervised learning tasks (shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction) on RGB or RGB-D images to improve spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: The proposed approach achieves average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) on seven benchmarks, demonstrating significant spatial understanding improvement while maintaining general visual abilities.

Conclusion: Spatial-SSRL provides a scalable and cost-effective method to improve spatial intelligence in LVLMs, showcasing that intrinsic supervision can enable reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards at scale.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a transformer-based model for sketch-to-layout generation, leveraging user-provided sketches as intuitive constraints and synthetically-generated training data to enhance usability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphic layout generation often requires complex constraints, hindering usability. This paper aims to simplify the process by using user-provided sketches as intuitive guidance.

Method: A multimodal transformer-based model is proposed that takes sketches and content assets as inputs. Synthetic sketches are generated at scale to train the model efficiently without costly human annotations.

Result: The model was trained and tested on PubLayNet, DocLayNet, and SlidesVQA datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art constraint-based methods in terms of quality and usability.

Conclusion: Sketch-to-layout is proposed as a promising research direction. The paper provides a publicly available resource of 200k synthetic sketches to encourage further exploration in this domain.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets
are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.

*Cesar H. Comin,Wesley N. Galvão*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of blood vessel segmentation in medical images using a new method called VessShape, which focuses on leveraging the geometric shape of vessels to improve model generalization across imaging domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the lack of large annotated datasets and poor generalization of models across different imaging modalities, particularly due to CNNs learning texture-based features instead of geometric aspects of vessels.

Method: The authors developed VessShape, a synthetic dataset that generates 2D images with tubular geometries combining various textures to induce a shape bias in segmentation models.

Result: Pre-training models on VessShape resulted in strong few-shot segmentation performance on real-world datasets and impressive zero-shot capabilities for unseen domains, highlighting robust generalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating a strong shape bias through synthetic data like VessShape can effectively address data scarcity and improve segmentation model performance for blood vessels in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NegoCollab, a method to address feature alignment issues in collaborative perception where agents have heterogeneous models, using a negotiated common representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents using different and fixed perception models face domain gaps in collaborative perception, limiting task performance.

Method: NegoCollab employs a negotiator to derive a common representation, with sender-receiver pairs managing feature transformation and three alignment losses (structural, pragmatic, distribution) for effective training.

Result: The proposed approach reduces inherent domain gaps and effectively distills multimodal knowledge into local agents' representations.

Conclusion: NegoCollab presents a novel solution for better feature alignment in heterogeneous collaborative perception, enhancing the shared knowledge and task efficiency among agents.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

### [156] [Gaussian Combined Distance: A Generic Metric for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27649)
*Ziqian Guan,Xieyi Fu,Pengjun Huang,Hengyuan Zhang,Hubin Du,Yongtao Liu,Yinglin Wang,Qang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) for object detection to address shortcomings of IoU and Wasserstein Distance, achieving state-of-the-art results on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoU metrics struggle with small object detection due to sensitivity to positional deviations, and Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance and slows convergence.

Method: GCD is proposed as a regression loss function and similarity metric, combining scale invariance and joint optimization for better localization performance.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm GCD's superior performance on AI-TOD-v2, MS-COCO-2017, and Visdrone-2019 datasets, outperforming existing metrics.

Conclusion: GCD achieves enhanced model localization and generalization across scales, validated by state-of-the-art results on popular datasets.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based denoising in microscopy workflows, enhancing analysis by reducing measurement noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of measurement noise in operando microscopy, which affects resolution and quantitative analysis of materials.

Method: Unsupervised deep learning-based denoising techniques are integrated into microscopy workflows to enhance resolution and reduce uncertainty in data analysis.

Result: Deep denoising preserved physical fidelity, reduced noise variability significantly, and enabled better imaging and analysis of material heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Deep denoising serves as a modality-agnostic enhancement that improves quantitative operando imaging, overcoming noise limitations and broadening the application of imaging techniques.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sh-ViT (Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight model for person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance, focusing on robustness against occlusion, blur, and viewpoint distortion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing person ReID methods struggle with challenges like occlusion, viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality in surveillance scenarios. These methods often rely on complex modules or fail to perform adequately on non-ideal images.

Method: The paper introduces Sh-ViT, based on ViT-Base, incorporating a Shuffle module to increase robustness, scenario-adapted augmentation to replicate surveillance conditions, and DeiT-based knowledge distillation for improved training with limited labels. A new dataset, MyTT, is also created for real-world evaluation.

Result: Sh-ViT achieves significant improvements, with 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on the MyTT dataset and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on Market1501, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Sh-ViT provides a practical and efficient solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring by enhancing robustness to occlusions and image quality challenges without relying on external modules.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded
person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a
Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and
enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate
surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve
learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the
MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base
station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations.
Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT,
outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on
Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves
robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical
solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.

TL;DR: The paper extends vision-language models (VLMs) to 3D PET/CT imaging, introducing a large dataset and proposing PETAR-4B for better report generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in applying VLMs to 3D medical imaging, which involves complex volumetric data and lengthy radiology reports.

Method: A dataset of lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations was created using a hybrid rule-based and large language model pipeline. The PETAR-4B model integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation.

Result: PETAR-4B substantially improves the quality of PET/CT report generation through enhanced global and fine-grained understanding.

Conclusion: PETAR-4B advances the capability of vision-language models in 3D medical imaging, achieving clinically coherent and localized findings.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phased DMD improves distribution matching distillation for generative models, addressing efficiency and diversity issues in multi-step distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations of one-step distillation in complex generative tasks, such as text-to-video generation, and the instability and diversity reduction in multi-step distillation.

Method: Introduces Phased DMD, combining phase-wise distillation and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), employing progressive distribution matching and score matching within subintervals.

Result: Phased DMD improves diversity and generative capabilities, validated on state-of-the-art image and video generation models like Qwen-Image and Wan2.2.

Conclusion: Phased DMD enhances model capacity and efficiency while preserving generative diversity, and authors will release the code and models.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

TL;DR: LifWavNet uses learnable lifting wavelet networks for accurate radar-to-ECG reconstruction and outperforms other methods in cardiac monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an unobtrusive method for cardiac monitoring using radar signals that can reliably reconstruct ECG data.

Method: A lifting wavelet network (LifWavNet) employing multi-resolution analysis with learnable lifting wavelets, combined with a multi-resolution short-time Fourier transform loss.

Result: LifWavNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing ECG and estimating vital signs, and demonstrates improved interpretability in radar-to-ECG processing.

Conclusion: LifWavNet proves to be a robust and effective framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement, advancing cardiac monitoring technology.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

*Junyi Shen,Noppanat Wadlom,Lingfeng Zhou,Dequan Wang,Xu Miao,Lei Fang,Yao Lu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlowMesh is a multi-tenant service fabric aiming to optimize AI workloads by sharing services rather than isolated pipelines, achieving significant cost and energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI deployment processes often involve complex workflows such as RLHF/RLAIF training and agentic setups, requiring better optimization of data processing and resource sharing.

Method: FlowMesh breaks AI workflows into fine-grained operators, records lineage, and employs a global control plane that balances cost, performance, and data locality using a cluster-wide strategy.

Result: FlowMesh reduces costs by up to 3.8x, energy consumption by 2.0x, while maintaining or improving latency under varying conditions.

Conclusion: FlowMesh successfully enhances the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of AI deployment processes, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: AI deployment increasingly resembles a pipeline of data transformation,
fine-tuning, and agent interactions rather than a monolithic LLM job; recent
examples include RLHF/RLAIF training and agentic workflows. To cope with this
shift, we propose FlowMesh, a multi-tenant service fabric that executes and
optimizes these workloads as one shared service instead of isolated pipelines.
It decomposes workflows into fine-grained operators with recorded lineage,
enabling de-duplication of work across users and batching requests on the same
hardware while preserving per-workflow provenance. A global control plane
maintains a cluster-wide pool of ready operators and uses a single utility
function to pick both the batch and the worker, balancing throughput, cost, and
data locality on heterogeneous GPUs. The data plane is an elastic fleet of
stateless workers backed by a content-addressable store, enabling rapid,
automatic scale-out, safe retry after preemption, and portability across
managed clusters such as Kubernetes and geo-distributed GPU marketplaces such
as Vast.ai. Compared with baseline solutions, FlowMesh achieves up to 3.8x cost
reduction and 2.0x lower energy usage, provides a similar or better latency
profile, and remains efficient under dynamic and failure-prone conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a cloud-based model combining Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and Transformers for effective traffic forecasting, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving traffic flow forecasting for ITS tasks like signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning by addressing challenges in capturing spatial-temporal dependencies.

Method: Developed a hybrid model integrating ST-GNNs and Transformers, leveraging spatial and temporal correlations while using a cloud platform for scalability and adaptability.

Result: The experimental results show superior performance to baseline methods, with RMSE of 17.92 and MAE of 10.53, demonstrating enhanced predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: The hybrid model proves effective for traffic forecasting in intelligent transportation systems, offering scalable and practical benefits like congestion mitigation.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for the development of
intelligent transportation systems (ITS), supporting tasks such as traffic
signal optimization, congestion management, and route planning. Traditional
models often fail to effectively capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies
in large-scale road networks, especially under the influence of external
factors such as weather, holidays, and traffic accidents. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based hybrid model that integrates
Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNN) with a Transformer architecture
for traffic flow prediction. The model leverages the strengths of GNNs in
modeling spatial correlations across road networks and the Transformers'
ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. External contextual
features are incorporated via feature fusion to enhance predictive accuracy.
The proposed model is deployed on a cloud computing platform to achieve
scalability and real-time adaptability. Experimental evaluation of the dataset
shows that our model outperforms baseline methods (LSTM, TCN, GCN, pure
Transformer) with an RMSE of only 17.92 and a MAE of only 10.53. These findings
suggest that the hybrid GNN-Transformer approach provides an effective and
scalable solution for cloud-based ITS applications, offering methodological
advancements for traffic flow forecasting and practical implications for
congestion mitigation.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a synergistic tensor and pipeline parallelism schedule to enhance training throughput, reducing communication and synchronization inefficiencies in distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) training suffer from high communication overhead in tensor parallelism (TP) and synchronization inefficiencies (pipeline bubbles) in pipeline parallelism (PP). The lack of a holistic solution motivated this work.

Method: The authors decouple the forward and backward passes in pipeline parallelism into fine-grained units, braiding them for a composite computation sequence. This eliminates TP-related bubbles and optimizes the PP schedule to reduce pipeline bubbles.

Result: The proposed method improved training throughput by up to 12% for LLMs and 16% for MLLMs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: This research provides a combined optimization method for tensor and pipeline parallelism that significantly enhances distributed training efficiency in LLMs and MLLMs, providing evidence for improved performance and offering publicly accessible source code.

Abstract: In the machine learning system, the hybrid model parallelism combining tensor
parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) has become the dominant solution
for distributed training of Large Language Models~(LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs). However, TP introduces significant collective communication overheads,
while PP suffers from synchronization inefficiencies such as pipeline bubbles.
Existing works primarily address these challenges from isolated perspectives,
focusing either on overlapping TP communication or on flexible PP scheduling to
mitigate pipeline bubbles. In this paper, we propose a new synergistic tensor
and pipeline parallelism schedule that simultaneously reduces both types of
bubbles. Our proposed schedule decouples the forward and backward passes in PP
into fine-grained computation units, which are then braided to form a composite
computation sequence. This compositional structure enables near-complete
elimination of TP-related bubbles. Building upon this structure, we further
design the PP schedule to minimize PP bubbles. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves training throughput by up to 12% for LLMs and 16%
for MLLMs compared to existing scheduling methods. Our source code is avaiable

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of coordinating decentralised systems, such as EVs in a V2G network, without compromising the privacy of participating agents.

Method: It proposes the DT-MADDPG algorithm that combines multi-agent deep reinforcement learning with a collaborative Digital Twin network, using a centralised critic enhanced by a privacy-preserving predictive model.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that DT-MADDPG achieves coordination performance comparable to standard MADDPG while ensuring significant gains in privacy and decentralisation.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical framework for intelligent coordination in decentralised, real-world cyber-physical systems by leveraging Digital Twin networks and advanced reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The coordination of large-scale, decentralised systems, such as a fleet of
Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) network, presents a
significant challenge for modern control systems. While collaborative Digital
Twins have been proposed as a solution to manage such systems without
compromising the privacy of individual agents, deriving globally optimal
control policies from the high-level information they share remains an open
problem. This paper introduces Digital Twin Assisted Multi-Agent Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DT-MADDPG) algorithm, a novel hybrid
architecture that integrates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
with a collaborative DT network. Our core contribution is a simulation-assisted
learning algorithm where the centralised critic is enhanced by a predictive
global model that is collaboratively built from the privacy-preserving data
shared by individual DTs. This approach removes the need for collecting
sensitive raw data at a centralised entity, a requirement of traditional
multi-agent learning algorithms. Experimental results in a simulated V2G
environment demonstrate that DT-MADDPG can achieve coordination performance
comparable to the standard MADDPG algorithm while offering significant
advantages in terms of data privacy and architectural decentralisation. This
work presents a practical and robust framework for deploying intelligent,
learning-based coordination in complex, real-world cyber-physical systems.

Motivation: Improving energy efficiency and sustainability in MEC systems while addressing energy intermittence and dynamic demand.

Method: Developed an online strategy for task scheduling, energy consumption governance, and server management in MEC systems.

Result: Experiments with real-world datasets showed efficient energy utilization and low service latency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances intermittent renewable energy with computational demands in MEC systems.

Abstract: Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) delivers low-latency services by hosting
applications near end-users. To promote sustainability, these systems are
increasingly integrated with renewable Energy Harvesting (EH) technologies,
enabling operation where grid electricity is unavailable. However, balancing

significant resource allocation challenge. This work proposes an online
strategy for an MEC system powered exclusively by EH to address this trade-off.
Our strategy dynamically schedules computational tasks with dependencies and
governs energy consumption through real-time decisions on server frequency
scaling and service module migration. Experiments using real-world datasets
demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in efficiently utilizing harvested

Motivation: The paper aims to find an optimal sub-system size for CUDA implementations of parallel partition algorithms to improve efficiency and computational performance.

Method: The paper employs computational experiments and the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification method to model and predict sub-system sizes, including recursive steps.

Result: The algorithm achieves acceptable performance in predicting optimum sub-system sizes and recursive steps through empirical verification.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning-based heuristic successfully finds optimal parameters for CUDA parallel partition algorithms, contributing to improved computations in SLAE problems.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning (ML)-based heuristic for finding the
optimum sub-system size for the CUDA implementation of the parallel partition
algorithm. Computational experiments for different system of linear algebraic
equation (SLAE) sizes are conducted, and the optimum sub-system size for each
of them is found empirically. To estimate a model for the sub-system size, we
perform the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classification method. Statistical
analysis of the results is done. By comparing the predicted values with the
actual data, the algorithm is deemed to be acceptably good. Next, the heuristic
is expanded to work for the recursive parallel partition algorithm as well. An
algorithm for determining the optimum sub-system size for each recursive step
is formulated. A kNN model for predicting the optimum number of recursive steps
for a particular SLAE size is built.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model systems rely heavily on flexible communication beyond simple collectives. However, existing implementations lack portability and are tied to specific NICs, limiting integration and wide usability.

Method: The authors developed TransferEngine, which provides a uniform communication interface by bridging typical NIC functionalities. It supports high-speed one-sided WriteImm operations with a completion primitive (ImmCounter), transparently managing multiple NICs per GPU.

Result: The system demonstrated a peak throughput of 400 Gbps on various NICs and was effectively applied in production systems for disaggregated inference, reinforcement learning updates, and MoE implementation, showcasing significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: TransferEngine offers a flexible and high-performance solution for point-to-point communication in LLM systems, avoiding hardware lock-in while enabling seamless integration and scalability.

Abstract: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) system patterns, such as disaggregated
inference, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing, and asynchronous reinforcement
fine-tuning, require flexible point-to-point communication beyond simple
collectives. Existing implementations are locked to specific Network Interface
Controllers (NICs), hindering integration into inference engines and
portability across hardware providers. We present TransferEngine, which bridges
the functionality of common NICs to expose a uniform interface. TransferEngine
exposes one-sided WriteImm operations with a ImmCounter primitive for
completion notification, without ordering assumptions of network transport,
transparently managing multiple NICs per GPU. We demonstrate peak throughput of
400 Gbps on both NVIDIA ConnectX-7 and AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). We
showcase TransferEngine through three production systems: (1) KvCache transfer
for disaggregated inference with dynamic scaling, (2) RL weight updates
achieving 1.3 seconds for trillion-parameter models, and (3) MoE
dispatch/combine implementation exceeding DeepEP decode latency on ConnectX-7,
with the first viable latencies on EFA. We demonstrate that our portable

*Svetlana Churina,Niranjan Chebrolu,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) under continual pre-training can internalize misinformation similar to humans, leading to persistent changes in factual belief representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the vulnerability of LLMs to misinformation during continual pre-training and assess to what extent repeated exposure can shift their internal representations of facts.

Method: The researchers introduced the Layer of Truth framework to probe LLM belief dynamics by injecting poisoned data during continual pre-training and analyzing intermediate representations across model checkpoints, sizes, and question types.

Result: Minimal exposure to false but confidently stated facts leads to persistent representational drift in LLMs, with variations in susceptibility across layers and model sizes.

Conclusion: Continually updated LLMs may internalize misinformation analogously to the illusory truth effect in humans, highlighting the need for monitoring and ensuring factual integrity when updating these models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to adversarial manipulations poses a significant risk for their deployment in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose SmoothGuard, a model-agnostic framework utilizing Gaussian noise injection to perturb input modalities and embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarial predictions, ensuring answer selection from the majority cluster.

Result: Experiments show that SmoothGuard enhances robustness against adversarial attacks on multiple benchmarks without compromising utility. Ablation studies identify the optimal noise range of 0.1-0.2 for balanced performance.

Conclusion: SmoothGuard effectively improves the safety and reliability of MLLMs in the presence of adversarial manipulations, ensuring resilient and stable outputs while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at

### [173] [CAS-Spec: Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding for On-the-Fly Lossless Inference Acceleration of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26843)
*Zhiyuan Ning,Jiawei Shao,Ruge Xu,Xinfei Guo,Jun Zhang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CAS-Spec, a methodology for speeding up speculative decoding in large language models, achieving notable acceleration improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve speculative decoding for large language models by addressing inefficiencies in training multiple models and traditional cascade algorithms.

Method: The paper proposes CAS-Spec, which uses dynamically switchable inference acceleration strategies and introduces a Dynamic Tree Cascade algorithm for adaptive routing and optimal draft model utilization.

Result: CAS-Spec achieves an average speedup of 1.1x to 2.3x compared to autoregressive decoding and improves speedup by 47%-48% over baseline algorithms.

Conclusion: CAS-Spec demonstrates state-of-the-art acceleration and can be seamlessly integrated with existing large language models, showing potential for further efficiency advancements.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

### [174] [BI-DCGAN: A Theoretically Grounded Bayesian Framework for Efficient and Diverse GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26892)
*Mahsa Valizadeh,Rui Tuo,James Caverlee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN, to address mode collapse in GANs and enhance output diversity with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs suffer from mode collapse, limiting their output diversity, which is critical for real-world applications requiring both diversity and uncertainty.

Method: The proposed BI-DCGAN incorporates Bayes by Backprop for learning weight distributions and uses mean-field variational inference to approximate posterior distributions. It provides theoretical proof that Bayesian approaches improve output diversity.

Result: BI-DCGAN shows improved diversity and robustness in output samples compared to traditional DCGANs, validated through experiments on standard generative benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper presents BI-DCGAN as a scalable and efficient generative model for applications requiring diversity and uncertainty, offering a viable alternative to resource-intensive methods like diffusion models.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a framework that combines structured domain knowledge with generative reasoning for precise applications in chemical engineering.

Method: The framework uses the COPE ontology, including data acquisition, semantic preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping, enabling fine-tuning through templated question-answer pairs.

Result: The approach constrains outputs to ontology-linked terms with syntactic and factual grounding and evaluates linguistic quality and ontological accuracy for reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The integration of symbolic ontology with neural language models enhances transparency and reliability in critical engineering applications like process control and safety analysis.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)
framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with
generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper aims at forecasting EV charging demand to facilitate cost-effective infrastructure using large-scale datasets and archetype-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in EV charging behavior understanding due to limited datasets and simplistic modeling approaches.

Method: A framework integrating clustering with few-shot forecasting, relying on a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand.

Result: Archetype-specific expert models provided better forecasting accuracy compared to global models, especially for unseen sites.

Conclusion: This framework aids infrastructure segmentation and provides insights critical to cost reduction and grid optimization to support climate goals.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MM-OPERA, a benchmark for testing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on open-ended associative reasoning tasks, revealing limitations in their human-like cognition capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the deficiencies in LVLMs, particularly in associative reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human cognition often neglected by existing benchmarks.

Method: Developed the MM-OPERA benchmark with 11,497 instances focused on open-ended tasks (RIA and ICA), employing LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations to assess reasoning precision, and conducted diverse analyses on current LVLMs.

Result: The study highlights the limitations of LVLMs in associative reasoning by analyzing task sensitivity, validity, and diversity across multiple parameters, offering a nuanced understanding of their current capabilities.

Conclusion: The findings underline the gap between LVLMs and human-like intelligence, suggesting that MM-OPERA can foster advancements in developing more versatile and cognitive AI systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

*Ashwin Kumar,Hanyu Zhang,David A. Schweidel,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness issues in mobility prediction models, highlighting demographic disparities and proposing methods to reduce them without significantly compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To audit and address hidden demographic disparities in mobility prediction models, which have significant societal impacts due to their application in mobility, retail, and public-health domains.

Method: The proposed solution includes Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), which prioritizes users for sampling based on performance gains and group representation, and Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a clustering approach to derive proxy racial labels based on mobility data and census proportions.

Result: The proposed methods reduced demographic performance gaps by up to 40% while maintaining minimal accuracy trade-offs, evaluated using MetaPath2Vec and transformer-encoder models.

Conclusion: The paper underscores structural inequities in mobility prediction pipelines and demonstrates the effectiveness of fairness-aware, data-centric solutions, particularly in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMOC framework and a dataset to support analyzing algorithm similarity in applications like clone detection and program synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a consistent similarity metric for determining meaningful differences between algorithms.

Method: An Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity (EMOC) framework embeds algorithm implementations into a feature space, using PACD, a curated Python dataset of verified implementations.

Result: EMOC features enable clustering, classification of algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and diversity quantification in LLM-generated programs.

Conclusion: EMOC provides a pragmatic approach to algorithm similarity analysis, offering tools and dataset for reproducibility and further exploration.

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an updated Turing Test considering energy efficiency to evaluate intelligence, addressing ethical and environmental concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Turing Test cannot address advanced AI systems and their impact on ethical and environmental challenges.

Method: The authors introduce an added constraint to the test: energy efficiency while answering questions.

Result: A new intelligence evaluation framework links thinking efficiency to resource management.

Conclusion: This updated test shifts intelligence assessment to practical contexts, emphasizing societal and resource considerations.

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

### [181] [Predicting Household Water Consumption Using Satellite and Street View Images in Two Indian Cities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26957)
*Qiao Wang,Joseph George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a method using satellite imagery, Google Street View segmentation, and geospatial covariates to predict household water consumption in urban India, achieving promising results comparable to survey-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find an alternative to costly and time-intensive household surveys for monitoring water usage in urban areas, using publicly available imagery and geospatial data.

Method: The paper compares survey-based predictions with CNN embeddings from satellite and Google Street View imagery, combining these with geospatial covariates under an ordinal classification framework.

Result: The GSV segmentation combined with remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for predicting water consumption, which is nearing the survey model's 0.59 accuracy. Errors mainly occur among mid-range classes due to overlapping visual indicators.

Conclusion: The study concludes that open-access imagery coupled with geospatial data presents a viable alternative for reliable household water consumption prediction, reducing reliance on expensive surveys.

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

*Zongshun Zhang,Ibrahim Matta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SERFLOW proposes a dynamic offloading system for ML model inference across FaaS and IaaS to reduce cloud costs and adapt to variable workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for optimized resource orchestration for adaptive inference applications due to inefficiencies in handling variable workloads and delays.

Method: SERFLOW utilizes a stage-specific resource provisioning model, combining FaaS-based containers and VM load balancing that adapts to dynamic request patterns.

Result: SERFLOW demonstrates a reduction in cloud costs by over 23% while efficiently adapting to dynamic workloads.

Conclusion: Dynamic offloading with stage-specific provisions and adaptive balancing boosts efficiency and reduces expenses in ML inference systems.

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

### [183] [Quantitative Bounds for Length Generalization in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27015)
*Zachary Izzo,Eshaan Nichani,Jason D. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates transformers' ability to generalize from shorter training sequences to longer unseen sequences, providing theoretical bounds for required training lengths and validating insights empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the conditions under which transformers generalize to longer sequence lengths beyond their training data.

Method: Analyzed length generalization in different problem settings, proving theoretical bounds for generalization based on internal behavior simulation between short and long sequences, and verified findings through empirical experiments.

Result: The paper established quantitative bounds for training lengths necessary for length generalization, with findings validated through experiments.

Conclusion: Transformers require sufficient training data lengths for length generalization, especially for complex tasks, enriching theoretical insights into extrapolation mechanisms.

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fine-grained control mechanism to maximize strength of iterative adversarial attacks under limited computational budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving the efficacy of adversarial attacks in AI safety research within fixed computation budgets.

Method: The authors propose selectively recomputing layer activations both iteration-wise and layer-wise to achieve effective attack strength while minimizing computational costs.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches at the same cost and achieves comparable performance in adversarial training with only 30% of the initial budget.

Conclusion: This method is a significant advancement in budget-efficient adversarial attacks and is highly effective for adversarial training scenarios.

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

*Zheng Nie,Peijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF) to enhance information extraction in review-based recommender systems through structured aspect-opinion extraction, addressing issues of hallucination and cost-quality trade-offs. It also proposes two new metrics for assessment and releases supporting resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to improve review-based recommender systems by addressing challenges in current methods such as noisy representations from free-form reviews, lack of metrics to evaluate LLM hallucinations, and unexplored cost-quality trade-offs in models of various scales.

Method: This paper presents HADSF, a two-stage framework. The first stage involves creating a compact aspect vocabulary via adaptive selection, and the second stage uses this vocabulary for constrained extraction of structured triple representations. The authors also introduce new metrics—Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion Fidelity Rate (OFR)—for evaluating the outputs.

Result: The experiments on a large-scale dataset of 3 million reviews demonstrate that HADSF reduces rating prediction errors, enables smaller models to perform competitively, and empirically shows how hallucination severity correlates with prediction error.

Conclusion: HADSF provides an effective solution for improving the quality of review-based recommender systems, balancing cost and quality across different model scales. The framework facilitates reproducible research by offering code, data pipelines, and metric implementations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

*Tong Zhao,Jiacheng Li,Yuanchang Zhou,Guangming Tan,Weile Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to enhance gradient-based optimizers using an adaptor "E" that enables further exploration along landscape valleys for better minima and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve deep learning optimization by finding minima that generalize better, overcoming the limitation of existing optimizers which stop at local minima without further exploration.

Method: An adaptor "E" is introduced to gradient-based optimizers, enabling them to search for flatter and lower minima even after reaching local minima. Convergence proof is provided for both convex and non-convex scenarios.

Result: The adapted optimizer (ALTO) demonstrated an average 2.5% improvement in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art Lamb optimizer in large-batch training tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptor improves optimizer performance, opens new possibilities for designing optimization algorithms, and aids in finding better-generalizing solutions in deep learning.

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical framework that treats learning rules as optimal control policies for navigating loss landscapes, showcasing their derivation under various assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain learning rules perform better and to derive them systematically as optimal solutions.

Method: Proposing a framework that treats learning rules as policies to solve optimal control problems based on assumptions about the loss landscape.

Result: Classifies existing learning rules (e.g., gradient descent, momentum, Adam) within the framework, explaining their emergence under different conditions.

Conclusion: This unified perspective enriches understanding, clarifies computational structures, and enables principled design of adaptive learning algorithms.

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

Motivation: The motivation is to solve the difficulty in reliably evaluating and comparing MAB algorithms due to lack of standardization and replicability, particularly for variance-aware methods.

Method: The authors designed a reproducible evaluation framework (Bandit Playground) with experimental setups, performance metrics, and an interactive interface for comparing MAB algorithms.

Result: The study demonstrates that variance-aware algorithms perform better in high-uncertainty environments, but classical algorithms are advantageous in more defined scenarios or after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a robust evaluation framework and provides new insights on when variance-aware algorithms outperform classical methods, aiding more transparent comparison and development of MAB algorithms.

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

### [189] [Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222)
*Jaebyeong Jeon,Hyeonseo Jang,Jy-yong Sohn,Kibok Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAR (Soft Task-Aware Routing), a strategy to improve joint invariant and equivariant representation learning by reducing redundant feature learning, showing better performance in transfer learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing joint learning of invariant and equivariant representations through separate projection heads often results in redundant feature learning and inefficient model capacity usage.

Method: The authors propose STAR, a routing mechanism that treats projection heads as experts, which specialize in either shared or task-specific information, reducing overlap in learned features.

Result: The STAR approach demonstrated reduced redundancy (lower canonical correlations) in embeddings and achieved consistent performance improvements across various transfer learning tasks.

Conclusion: STAR effectively optimizes the joint learning of invariant and equivariant representations, leading to better utilization of model capacity and enhanced performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract introduces Jasmine, a JAX-based world modeling codebase optimized for scalability and performance, significantly improving training and benchmarking processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are limited by data scarcity in robotics, and there is a lack of open training infrastructure.

Method: They created Jasmine, a scalable and optimized codebase for world modeling, focusing on performance enhancements in data loading, training, and checkpointing.

Result: Jasmine achieves faster reproduction of benchmarks like CoinRun and supports fully reproducible training with diverse configurations.

Conclusion: By integrating Jasmine with large datasets, it facilitates effective benchmarking, advancing infrastructure and research in world modeling.

Abstract: While world models are increasingly positioned as a pathway to overcoming
data scarcity in domains such as robotics, open training infrastructure for
world modeling remains nascent. We introduce Jasmine, a performant JAX-based
world modeling codebase that scales from single hosts to hundreds of
accelerators with minimal code changes. Jasmine achieves an order-of-magnitude
faster reproduction of the CoinRun case study compared to prior open
implementations, enabled by performance optimizations across data loading,
training and checkpointing. The codebase guarantees fully reproducible training
and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated
large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking
pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.

*Hongbo Li,Qinhang Wu,Sen Lin,Yingbin Liang,Ness B. Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) framework to study expert specialization in transformer models, theoretically and practically demonstrating enhanced efficiency and learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified theoretical explanations for Mixture-of-Experts models, specifically focusing on feed-forward and attention layer specialization in transformers.

Method: Developed a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) framework with continuous gating network training, implementing a three-stage training algorithm. This isolates learning dynamics such as expert specialization and attention alignment.

Result: Each transformer expert specializes in distinct tasks, and the gating network successfully routes data to the correct expert. Convex gradient conflicts are reduced, and prediction loss approaches zero at a faster rate than single transformer models.

Conclusion: This study offers a unified theoretical understanding of transformer specialization, demonstrating efficiency improvements while guiding practical large-scale model designs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel sentiment classification approach using Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) outperforms traditional methods with 97.072% accuracy on the IMDB dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and efficiency in sentiment classification by leveraging diverse ensemble models rather than scaling individual models.

Method: Application of CFA, integrating predictions from transformer-based RoBERTa and traditional models (Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost) using cognitive diversity and rank-score characteristic functions.

Result: The proposed CFA ensemble achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (97.072%) on the IMDB sentiment analysis dataset, outperforming traditional ensemble methods.

Conclusion: CFA offers a resource-efficient and effective approach to sentiment classification by strategically combining diverse models rather than increasing model size.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

*Md Tanvirul Alam,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) on mathematical reasoning tasks and finds that while RLVR improves metrics, it often reinforces heuristics rather than genuine reasoning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether RLVR fosters genuine mathematical reasoning or just exploits superficial heuristics when applied to mathematical problem-solving by LLMs.

Method: The authors use RLVR on two combinatorial problems, Activity Scheduling and Longest Increasing Subsequence, leveraging datasets with unique solutions to examine reasoning behavior under different reward designs.

Result: RLVR improves evaluation metrics but primarily by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than developing genuine reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RLVR's generalization is limited, and there is a critical need for benchmarks that distinguish real mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and accurately measure progress.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

### [194] [Consistency Training Helps Stop Sycophancy and Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27062)
*Alex Irpan,Alexander Matt Turner,Mark Kurzeja,David K. Elson,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces consistency training as a self-supervised method to reduce model susceptibility to irrelevant prompt cues, addressing sycophancy and jailbreaking issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language models struggle with prompt-related vulnerabilities like adopting user beliefs or fulfilling inappropriate requests, impacting factuality and refusal reliability.

Method: Proposes two consistency training methods: Bias-augmented Consistency Training (BCT) and Activation Consistency Training (ACT), aiming for model response invariance across prompt augmentations.

Result: Both BCT and ACT reduce vulnerability to irrelevant cues, with BCT outperforming ACT in mitigating jailbreak risks.

Conclusion: Consistency training ensures model reliability without relying on stale datasets. Alignment should focus on consistency issues, not perfect responses.

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

### [195] [Towards Understanding Self-play for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27072)
*Justin Yang Chae,Md Tanvirul Alam,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates self-play post-training in large language models (LLMs), evaluating its mechanisms and benefits compared to other strategies like RLVR and supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why self-play training in LLMs achieves improvements in reasoning tasks, despite the underlying mechanisms being poorly understood.

Method: Analyzed self-play dynamics with metrics like parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics, and proposer reward functions, comparing it with RLVR and supervised fine-tuning. Reasoning performance was evaluated using pass@k.

Result: The study clarified distinctions between self-play and other post-training strategies, identified its limitations, and suggested how self-play can be improved for better LLM math reasoning.

Conclusion: Self-play post-training offers distinct and promising advantages for reasoning in LLMs, but there are inherent limitations that require further exploration to achieve optimal performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

### [196] [Functional embeddings enable Aggregation of multi-area SEEG recordings over subjects and sessions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27090)
*Sina Javadzadeh,Rahil Soroushmojdehi,S. Alireza Seyyed Mousavi,Mehrnaz Asadi,Sumiko Abe,Terence D. Sanger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to aggregate intracranial recordings across subjects by leveraging representation learning and transformer models for analyzing neural data with varying electrode setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging due to variability in electrode count, placement, and covered regions, as well as the inadequacy of traditional spatial normalization methods to reflect true functional similarity.

Method: The authors propose a two-step framework: a Siamese encoder with contrastive objectives to create functionally meaningful electrode embeddings, and a transformer that operates on these embeddings to model inter-regional relationships across variable electrode configurations.

Result: The framework achieved accurate within-subject discrimination, formed region-consistent clusters in functional space, transferred well to unseen channels, captured cross-region dependencies, and reconstructed masked channels without subject-specific tunes.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable, subject-agnostic solution to aggregate intracranial data across subjects, forming the groundwork for large-scale analysis and pretraining even when task consistency and uniform sensor placement are not available.

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

*Yiwei Chen,Kehuan Yan,Yu Pan,Daoyi Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal fusion, focusing on improved entanglement modeling and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apply principles from quantum theory, such as superposition and entanglement, to improve multimodal machine learning models while addressing challenges like training instability and generalization.

Method: QiNN-QJ encodes each modality into quantum states and employs quantum jump operators for entanglement. It incorporates Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators to stabilize training and shape cross-modal entanglement.

Result: QiNN-QJ outperforms state-of-the-art models on datasets (CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS) while improving interpretability through entropy-based evaluation.

Conclusion: The work presents a structured quantum-inspired approach for multimodal fusion, offering both performance improvement and post-hoc interpretability of entangled representations.

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

*Crystal Su,Kuai Yu,Mingyuan Shao,Daniel Bauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian model deconvolves bulk RNA-seq data to infer cell type-specific expression and proportions using single-cell references, focusing on dynamic changes in endometrial tissue during the menstrual cycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bulk RNA sequencing often masks cell type-specific gene expression due to averaging, especially in tissues with dynamic cellular composition changes.

Method: The study introduces a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses single-cell reference data to deconvolute bulk RNA-seq and infer cell type-specific gene expression and proportions.

Result: Validation of the method shows accurate inference of dynamic shifts in cell fractions, cell type-specific differential expression, and robustness to reference mismatches.

Conclusion: The model offers insights into cellular dynamics during the menstrual cycle and has implications for understanding endometrial disorders and fertility, with future prospects in spatial transcriptomics integration.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

*Yihong Guo,Junjie Luo,Guodong Gao,Ritu Agarwal,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fairness-focused approach to offline contextual bandits, addressing group-wise reward disparities during policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline contextual bandits optimize policies using historical data, but they risk amplifying reward disparities across groups, raising fairness concerns.

Method: The authors introduce group-sensitive fairness constraints into an offline policy optimization framework. They incorporate reward disparity constraints specifically using a doubly robust estimator in a gradient-based off-policy optimization.

Result: Their empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal reduced reward disparities without compromising competitive overall performance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances fairness and performance in offline policy optimization, demonstrating its potential to mitigate fairness concerns in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

Result: Agentic AI systems have significantly reduced drug discovery timelines, achieving processes in hours that previously took months, while maintaining scientific traceability.

Conclusion: Agentic AI systems show transformative potential in drug discovery, though challenges such as data heterogeneity, reliability, privacy, and benchmarking remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are emerging as transformative tools in
drug discovery, with the ability to autonomously reason, act, and learn through
complicated research workflows. Building on large language models (LLMs)
coupled with perception, computation, action, and memory tools, these agentic
AI systems could integrate diverse biomedical data, execute tasks, carry out
experiments via robotic platforms, and iteratively refine hypotheses in closed
loops. We provide a conceptual and technical overview of agentic AI
architectures, ranging from ReAct and Reflection to Supervisor and Swarm
systems, and illustrate their applications across key stages of drug discovery,
including literature synthesis, toxicity prediction, automated protocol
generation, small-molecule synthesis, drug repurposing, and end-to-end
decision-making. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive work
to present real-world implementations and quantifiable impacts of agentic AI
systems deployed in operational drug discovery settings. Early implementations
demonstrate substantial gains in speed, reproducibility, and scalability,
compressing workflows that once took months into hours while maintaining
scientific traceability. We discuss the current challenges related to data
heterogeneity, system reliability, privacy, and benchmarking, and outline
future directions towards technology in support of science and translation.

*Hong Jiao,Hanna Choi,Haowei Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study assessed automated essay scoring using GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 rationales, comparing essay-based and rationale-based scoring. Ensemble models combining both approaches yielded the highest scoring accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of automated scoring systems using advanced language models like GPT-4.1 and GPT-5 on essay datasets.

Method: Essay scoring was performed using direct essay-based methods and rationale-based methods generated by AI. Ensemble models were created to combine these scoring methods.

Result: Essay-based scoring outperformed rationale-based scoring in general, but rationale-based scoring improved accuracy for infrequent scores. Combined ensemble models achieved high accuracy, surpassing previous literature with a QWK of 0.870.

Conclusion: Combining rationale-based and essay-based scoring enhances overall accuracy, indicating that integrating AI-generated rationales adds value to automated scoring systems.

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairAD, a fair graph clustering method that ensures demographic fairness while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing concerns about machine learning models displaying biases against certain demographic groups, particularly in graph clustering.

Method: Develop FairAD, which constructs an affinity matrix using algebraic distances, employs graph coarsening for representative nodes, and solves a constrained minimization problem for clustering.

Result: FairAD achieves fair clustering on datasets while being up to 40 times faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: FairAD presents a promising solution for computationally efficient and fair graph clustering, addressing demographic fairness issues in machine learning models.

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

*Sein Kwon,Seulgi Baek,Hyunseo Yang,Youngwan Jo,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RelTune provides a novel framework that uses relational graphs and GNN-based embeddings for DBMS parameter tuning, outperforming conventional methods in terms of efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to optimize DBMS configuration parameters by addressing limitations such as disregarded parameter dependencies, restricted optimization dimensions, and unstable Bayesian Optimization predictions.

Method: RelTune uses Relational Graph representations and GNN-based embeddings to encode dependencies between parameters. Additionally, it innovates Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO) for improved configuration selection by combining surrogate model predictions with affinity scoring.

Result: RelTune showed superior convergence speed and optimization efficiency compared to traditional Bayesian Optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance across different databases and workloads.

Conclusion: RelTune successfully resolves current deficiencies in DBMS parameter tuning, offering improved reliability and adaptability through its relation-aware methodology. This approach advances automated configuration optimization.

Abstract: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale
and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by
configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for
adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.
RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),
which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity
to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple
DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and
higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

### [204] [Adaptive Defense against Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Bayesian Data Scheduler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27172)
*Zixuan Hu,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Yongxian Wei,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive defense mechanism for fine-tuning large language models without relying on attack simulations, offering robust protection against harmful fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current defense strategies against harmful fine-tuning, such as their dependency on bounded threat models and inability to adapt to diverse attack scenarios.

Method: The authors propose BDS, which reframes harmful fine-tuning defense as a Bayesian inference problem. It assigns safety weights to data points based on their posterior safety attributes and integrates a neural scheduler for efficiency and adaptability.

Result: The proposed BDS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a variety of attack and defense settings, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: BDS successfully mitigates the risks of harmful fine-tuning in large language models by adopting a simulation-free, adaptive Bayesian approach and proves its capability to generalize across various scenarios.

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

### [205] [A Polynomial-time Algorithm for Online Sparse Linear Regression with Improved Regret Bound under Weaker Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27177)
*Junfan Li,Shizhong Liao,Zenglin Xu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the NP-hard problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR) with constraints on observable attributes. It introduces a novel polynomial-time algorithm to improve regret bounds under a weaker assumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations imposed by the NP-hardness of OSLR, focusing on developing efficient solutions under weaker assumptions than existing approaches.

Method: The paper proposes a new algorithm leveraging the Dantzig Selector with advanced techniques, such as algorithm-dependent sampling for covariance estimation, adaptive parameter tuning, and batching online Newton steps.

Result: The algorithm achieves tighter convergence rates for the $ll_1$-norm error and improves previous regret bounds under weaker compatibility conditions. The results also extend to scenarios allowing additional observations.

Conclusion: This work enhances the scope of OSLR models, providing efficient solutions with better regret bounds under relaxed assumptions, and extends to cases with additional observations.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

*Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MDAS-GNN, a novel Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Graph Neural Network, for accurate traffic accident predictions using spatial and temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic accidents claim millions of lives annually, and existing models fail to capture complex spatial-temporal relationships in urban networks.

Method: MDAS-GNN utilizes feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to analyze traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risks.

Result: MDAS-GNN outperforms baseline methods with lower prediction errors, particularly excelling in long-term forecasts and reducing errors by up to 40%.

Conclusion: The proposed model offers advanced predictive tools for urban planners, aiding road network optimization and strategic safety interventions in urban development.

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development
projects.

### [207] [Feature-Function Curvature Analysis: A Geometric Framework for Explaining Differentiable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27207)
*Hamed Najafi,Dongsheng Luo,Jason Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA), a new approach to explainable AI (XAI) that provides dynamic, multi-dimensional insights into machine learning models' learning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional attribution methods in XAI are limited by their static, oversimplified interpretations, failing to capture the non-linearity and interactions in models' behavior. This paper aims to address the need for a more nuanced explanation framework that reveals how models learn over time.

Method: The authors propose FFCA, a framework based on analyzing a model's learned function geometry. FFCA generates a 4D signature (Impact, Volatility, Non-linearity, and Interaction) for each feature and extends this to a Dynamic Archetype Analysis to track these metrics over the training process.

Result: The study demonstrates the utility of FFCA in providing detailed insights into hierarchical learning, model capacity issues, and overfitting predictions. It validates FFCA through experiments that highlight its effectiveness in both static and dynamic contexts.

Conclusion: FFCA advances XAI by transitioning from simple static quantifications to a comprehensive, trustworthy analysis of learning dynamics, making it a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving AI models.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

### [208] [FedSM: Robust Semantics-Guided Feature Mixup for Bias Reduction in Federated Learning with Long-Tail Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27240)
*Jingrui Zhang,Yimeng Xu,Shujie Li,Feng Liang,Haihan Duan,Yanjie Dong,Victor C. M. Leung,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSM enhances Federated Learning by mitigating bias using a client-centric framework and semantic-guided feature mixup, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the bias in global models caused by non-IID and long-tail data distributions in Federated Learning.

Method: FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model for semantic relevance computation, introducing semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight local classifier retraining for bias correction.

Result: Extensive experiments show FedSM achieves higher accuracy, robustness against domain shifts, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedSM effectively mitigates bias in FL, offering an innovative solution with minimal server overhead and improved model performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from
biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We
propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this
bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier
retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute
category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local
features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent
pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data
are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between
the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection,
enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations
are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments
on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high
robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

### [209] [Not All Instances Are Equally Valuable: Towards Influence-Weighted Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27253)
*Qiyan Deng,Changqian Zheng,Lianpeng Qiao,Yuping Wang,Chengliang Chai,Lei Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Influence-Weighted Distillation (IWD), a method improving dataset distillation by weighting data based on quality, leading to better distilled datasets and up to 7.8% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset distillation is hindered by the assumption that all data contributes equally, neglecting the varying quality of instances in real-world datasets, which can harm model performance.

Method: The proposed IWD approach uses influence functions to assign adaptive weights to data instances during distillation, favoring beneficial data and reducing the impact of harmful ones.

Result: Empirical studies show IWD integration improves distilled dataset quality and enhances model performance, achieving up to 7.8% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Influence-Weighted Distillation improves dataset distillation frameworks by addressing data quality, offering significant performance benefits and better synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECVL-ROUTER, a framework designed to optimize the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by dynamically routing queries to either large or small models based on user requirements such as speed, quality, and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of relying solely on either large cloud-based VLMs (high latency and energy cost) or small edge-device VLMs (limited capabilities) by efficiently combining their strengths for diverse user scenarios.

Method: Proposes ECVL-ROUTER, a routing framework that uses a novel strategy and evaluation metrics for dynamically assigning queries to the appropriate model. It also involves the creation of a multimodal response-quality dataset for training the router.

Result: The approach routes over 80% of queries to the small model with less than a 10% reduction in problem-solving ability, showcasing its high efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: ECVL-ROUTER balances trade-offs between fast response, high-quality outputs, and low energy consumption by dynamically leveraging both large and small VLMs, achieving optimal performance across diverse user requirements.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

### [211] [Higher-order Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27258)
*Yifan Zhang,Zhen Qin,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a scalable mechanism for autoregressive language models that avoids quadratic cost while maintaining expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models face challenges scaling to long contexts due to the quadratic cost of attention mechanisms. Efficient alternatives like Linear Attention and State Space Models often suffer from limited expressivity.

Method: The authors propose HLA, a streaming mechanism for higher-order interactions. It utilizes compact prefix statistics to efficiently compute outputs in linear time, avoids large matrix computations, and introduces causal masked variants and chunk-parallel training for scalability.

Result: The proposed method achieves linear-time computation with constant-size states while maintaining expressive capabilities. The authors describe its enhancements for higher-order variants and showcase its utility for scalable and efficient language modeling.

Conclusion: HLA represents a principled, scalable alternative to existing attention mechanisms, combining efficiency with flexibility for autoregressive models, and is positioned as a robust tool for long-context processing.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to
scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention
and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically
restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit
expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal,
streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix
sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size
state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any
$n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly
causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel
training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a
serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher
orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable
building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the
efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inconsistencies in evaluation protocols and the limitation in OOD datasets in previous research, and to improve deployment decisions in risk-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Developed a comprehensive benchmark (ODP-Bench), containing commonly utilized OOD datasets, performance prediction algorithms, and pre-trained models available for testing.

Result: ODP-Bench facilitates fair comparisons and reduces the burden of model training while offering insights into the boundaries of prediction capabilities through experimental analyses.

Conclusion: ODP-Bench enhances the ability to predict OOD performance, aiding researchers in consistent and thorough evaluations for safer and practical deployments.

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network designed to improve Drug-Target Affinity prediction by integrating global semantic and local structural features with a multi-scale representation of drug data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of sequence-based DTA prediction models that overlook global semantics, local structural features, and multi-scale drug representations, resulting in potential inefficacy in drug discovery.

Method: HiF-DTA utilizes a dual-pathway strategy to extract both global sequence semantic and local topological features, while incorporating atomic, substructural, and molecular-scale representations through a multi-scale bilinear attention mechanism.

Result: The proposed HiF-DTA outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets, and ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Conclusion: HiF-DTA demonstrates a significant improvement in DTA prediction by integrating robust global and local feature analysis alongside multi-scale modeling, proving its efficiency for computational drug discovery.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

Result: The method improves heart rate estimation by up to 40% compared to traditional techniques, validated across four real-life datasets.

Conclusion: Incorporating chaos theory principles enhances heart rate prediction while reducing reliance on various sensing modalities and eliminating post-processing steps.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores machine learning-based anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic, highlighting the advantages of streaming learning over batch models in handling concept drift. It evaluates the performance of tree-based ML algorithms for this use case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing volume of IoT traffic and the need for robust anomaly detection methods that can adapt to concept drift in real time.

Method: Compared batch and streaming learning approaches for binary classification of IoT traffic anomalies. Created simulated heterogeneous network data streams by combining datasets and streaming samples incrementally. Benchmarked algorithms with focus on computational efficiency and detection accuracy.

Result: Streaming learning models, particularly Adaptive Random Forest and Hoeffding Adaptive Tree, exhibited superior performance and computational efficiency in handling concept drift compared to batch models. Adaptive Random Forest achieved high F1-scores at reduced costs.

Conclusion: Streaming learning offers significant advantages over batch learning for IoT anomaly detection, especially in handling concept drift and reducing computational burden. However, limitations in IoT datasets hinder further progress.

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

### [217] [Un-Attributability: Computing Novelty From Retrieval & Semantic Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27313)
*Philipp Davydov,Ameya Prabhu,Matthias Bethge,Elisa Nguyen,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an operational measure of semantic novelty called un-attributability, analyzing outputs from language models to determine whether they can be attributed to pretraining data, and presents findings about model behaviors related to novelty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how language model outputs relate to their pretraining data and assess the novelty of their outputs, which can inform improvements in model behavior and performance.

Method: The authors implement a two-stage retrieval pipeline using GIST embeddings for indexing and ColBERTv2 for reranking to measure the semantic similarity between outputs and pretraining examples. They define un-attributability when the output is less attributable than human-generated text references.

Result: Key findings: models use data over longer spans than previously known; certain domains affect novelty differently; instruction tuning increases both stylistic changes and novelty.

Conclusion: Un-attributability is a scalable approach to novelty analysis, allowing systematic examination of language model outputs at pretraining scale. They provide datasets and artifacts for replication and further research.

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

Result: MedM2T outperformed existing models in three tasks—cardiovascular disease prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay regression—achieving high AUROC, AUPRC, and low mean absolute error.

Conclusion: MedM2T demonstrates robustness and broad applicability in clinical prediction tasks and can guide future multimodal data modeling in healthcare.

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at

### [219] [Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27338)
*Arun Jose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Outcome-based reinforcement learning for reasoning models often reduces the legibility of chain-of-thought processes, making intentions harder to monitor despite high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and monitor language models' reasoning processes by examining their chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs, especially in the context of RL-based training.

Method: Analyzed legibility of CoTs across 14 reasoning models trained via RL, studied correlation between legibility and accuracy, and evaluated legibility across varying question difficulties.

Result: RL-trained models produced illegible reasoning despite generating accurate answers, with legibility degrading for harder questions and no clear correlation between legibility and accuracy during resampling.

Conclusion: Outcome-based RL leads to increasingly opaque reasoning processes in models without explicit legibility optimization, which complicates monitoring for intention or malicious behavior.

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

### [220] [Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378)
*Austin Meek,Eitan Sprejer,Iván Arcuschin,Austin J. Brockmeier,Steven Basart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses improving the evaluation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in models by introducing a monitorability score based on faithfulness and verbosity, showing that models often lack comprehensive reasoning transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the visibility into a model's reasoning process through CoT, ensuring safe and aligned AI behavior by addressing challenges in assessing faithfulness and verbosity.

Method: The proposed method combines faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score applied to assess instruction-tuned and reasoning models using datasets like BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. It uses the Inspect library for reproducible evaluations.

Result: The results demonstrate that even seemingly faithful models can lack critical reasoning transparency, leading to varied monitorability across different model families.

Conclusion: It concludes that better evaluation metrics for CoT are essential for improving AI safety and alignment, with released tools encouraging further reproducible research.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

### [221] [FedMuon: Accelerating Federated Learning with Matrix Orthogonalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27403)
*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Junchao Zhou,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedMuon, a novel optimizer that mitigates communication bottlenecks in Federated Learning (FL) through matrix orthogonalization to optimize matrix-structured parameters, improving convergence and communication efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods neglect the geometric structure of weight matrices during local updates, resulting in slow convergence due to the amplification of pathological directions and poor condition numbers.

Method: The paper implements the Muon optimizer for local matrix orthogonalization and introduces a Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon) to address client drift in non-IID scenarios using techniques like momentum aggregation and local-global alignment.

Result: FedMuon achieves linear speedup convergence rate theoretically and demonstrates reduced communication rounds while improving test accuracy on language and vision models compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed FedMuon optimizer effectively enhances FL by addressing communication rounds bottleneck and client drift challenges, offering improved accuracy and efficiency in both IID and non-IID settings.

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

### [222] [Atlas-Alignment: Making Interpretability Transferable Across Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27413)
*Bruno Puri,Jim Berend,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introducing Atlas-Alignment, a framework that transfers interpretability across language models by aligning latent spaces, enabling semantic retrieval and steerable generation without costly labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability pipelines for language models are expensive and challenging due to model-specific training and manual labeling processes.

Method: Atlas-Alignment aligns unknown latent spaces of language models to a labeled human-interpretable Concept Atlas using lightweight representational alignment techniques.

Result: The approach allows robust semantic search and retrieval, as well as steering generation along interpretable concepts without the need for labeled concept data.

Conclusion: Investing in a single high-quality Concept Atlas enables scalable interpretability and control across multiple models with minimal additional cost.

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

*Meenu Ravi,Shailik Sarkar,Yanshen Sun,Vaishnavi Singh,Chang-Tien Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVeLMA, a machine learning pipeline designed to predict vegetation loss due to wildfires, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods and generating actionable insights for ecological recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of understanding and predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss, including the lack of multimodal feature integration, interpretability issues in predictive modeling, and the need for targeted recovery strategies.

Method: Proposed an ML pipeline called MVeLMA which incorporates a multimodal feature integration and stacked ensemble architecture. It also uses probabilistic modeling for uncertainty estimation and generates confidence maps for vegetation loss prediction.

Result: MVeLMA outperformed state-of-the-art and baseline models in predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss, offering high accuracy and actionable predictions.

Conclusion: MVeLMA contributes to improving disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery by providing a robust framework to predict and manage post-wildfire vegetation loss.

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

### [224] [Spectral Neural Graph Sparsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27474)
*Angelica Liguori,Ettore Ritacco,Pietro Sabatino,Annalisa Socievole*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral Preservation Network is a graph learning framework using reduced graphs for better efficiency and adaptive transformations with strong experimental performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph learning models are hindered by fixed structures and over-smoothing. Developing a more adaptive and efficient representation is necessary.

Method: The proposed approach combines Joint Graph Evolution layer to adaptively transform graph topology and node features, and Spectral Concordance loss for spectral and feature consistency.

Result: Experimental analysis shows the framework excels in node-level sparsification while outperforming existing methods on key metrics.

Conclusion: Spectral Preservation Network is effective in addressing structural rigidity and computational demands, advancing the application of graph learning.

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

*Bernardo Williams,Victor M. Yeom-Song,Marcelo Hartmann,Arto Klami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for modeling categorical data by mapping the simplex to Euclidean space using smooth bijections based on Aitchison geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in modeling categorical data and probability distributions on the simplex.

Method: The approach uses smooth bijections derived from Aitchison geometry to map the simplex to Euclidean space, enabling density modeling in Euclidean space and employing Dirichlet interpolation to handle discrete observations.

Result: The proposed method competes well against prior approaches on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective alternative to existing approaches, combining Euclidean space modeling with respect for simplex geometry.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

### [226] [Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484)
*Uzay Macar,Paul C. Bogdan,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores model reasoning beyond single chain-of-thoughts (CoT) using resampling methods for causal analysis, intervention studies, and understanding reasoning steps effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research typically focuses on a single chain-of-thought (CoT), which is insufficient for comprehending reasoning models as they operate over distributions of CoTs.

Method: The paper utilizes resampling techniques for causal analysis, measuring influence of specific reasoning sentences, intervening more systematically in reasoning adjustments, introducing a resilience metric for CoT edits, and adapting causal mediation analysis.

Result: Resampling proved more reliable than traditional approaches for studying reasoning, enabling measurements of causal impacts, evaluations of interventions, resilience insights, and subtle hint effects even in unfaithful reasoning settings.

Conclusion: Resampling-based analyses improve understanding of causal structure, reasoning narratives, and design of principled interventions, underscoring the importance of studying distributions in reasoning models.

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

*Junkang Liu,Fanhua Shang,Kewen Zhu,Hongying Liu,Yuanyuan Liu,Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedAdamW, a federated learning optimizer addressing challenges in applying AdamW in federated settings. It improves convergence speed and performance for large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize the effectiveness of AdamW in federated learning, where challenges such as data heterogeneity, local overfitting, and slow convergence due to moment reinitialization exist.

Method: The paper proposes FedAdamW, combining a local correction mechanism and decoupled weight decay to mitigate overfitting. It aggregates mean second-moment estimates to reduce variance and theoretically proves a linear speedup convergence rate. PAC-Bayesian analysis is employed to support the approach.

Result: FedAdamW achieves significant improvement in communication efficiency and test accuracy on language and vision Transformer models. The empirical results validate the algorithm's superior performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: FedAdamW effectively addresses shortcomings of AdamW in federated learning environments, providing both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation of its benefits.

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

TL;DR: Transformer-based autoregressive models are extended to 3D molecule generation using InertialAR, which aligns molecules to their inertial frames and models hybrid atom-based tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in transforming molecules into invariant 1D sequences and designing architectures for hybrid atom-based tokens.

Method: InertialAR introduces canonical tokenization and geometric rotary positional encoding, along with a hierarchical autoregressive paradigm using Diffusion loss.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in 3D molecule generation and controllable generation across several benchmarks and metrics.

Conclusion: InertialAR provides a novel solution to 3D molecule generation challenges, achieving strong performance and advancing the capabilities of autoregressive models in this domain.

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm
across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule
generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental
challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens
that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,
and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens
that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address
these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical
tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms
to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the
attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional
encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive
paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first
and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for
unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover,
it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for
targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all
5 metrics.

TL;DR: The paper proposes DP-FedPGN, a new Client-level Differentially Private Federated Learning (CL-DPFL) algorithm, introducing a global gradient norm penalty to address generalization issues and improve convergence while ensuring strict privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation in Federated Learning caused by inference attacks and sharp loss landscapes in Client-level Differentially Private Federated Learning (CL-DPFL).

Method: The DP-FedPGN algorithm integrates a global gradient norm penalty into the local loss function to achieve global flat minimums while utilizing R\'enyi DP for privacy assurance and sensitivity analysis.

Result: The proposed DP-FedPGN demonstrates significant improvements in reducing performance degradation caused by differential privacy, eliminating data heterogeneity impact, achieving better convergence, and demonstrating effectiveness across six visual and NLP tasks using ResNet and Transformer models.

Conclusion: DP-FedPGN enhances generalization, mitigates gradient clipping errors, achieves fast convergence, and provides strict privacy guarantees, outperforming existing state-of-the-art FL algorithms in various tasks.

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

*Zherui Yang,Zhehao Li,Kangbo Lyu,Yixuan Li,Tao Du,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a GPU-friendly learning-based method for generating sparse approximate inverse (SPAI) preconditioners using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance the conjugate gradient solver's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preconditioners struggle with GPU parallelization and modeling long-range dependencies. This paper aims to overcome these challenges while leveraging optimization from data.

Method: The method involves using GNNs to construct SPAI preconditioners, avoiding triangular solves, and introducing a scale-invariant loss function that aligns with characteristics of conjugate gradient solvers.

Result: Evaluations on several datasets show improved GPU performance with 40%-53% solution time reduction, better condition numbers, and superior generalization compared to traditional and previous learning-based preconditioners.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates significant advances in efficiency and accuracy for GPU-based preconditioning tasks, with promising applications across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

*Théo Gnassounou,Yessin Moakher,Shifeng Xie,Vasilii Feofanov,Ievgen Redko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of general-purpose time series foundation models for specific tasks in electroencephalography (EEG), including motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction. The results show that such models outperform traditional EEG models and highlight the potential of cross-domain pretrained models for EEG analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether general-purpose time series foundation models, developed for heterogeneous data or synthetic signals, can be effectively applied to specialized EEG tasks, addressing a gap in exploring their potential for biomedical signals.

Method: The study tested the foundation models under two pretraining settings: (a) pretraining on diverse real-world time series from multiple domains and (b) pretraining solely on synthetic data. These models were then evaluated on EEG tasks, comparing them to existing baselines like EEGNet and CBraMod.

Result: Both pretraining approaches resulted in strong performance, with the models outperforming existing EEG-specific models such as EEGNet and CBraMod consistently.

Conclusion: General-purpose time series foundation models, even those pretrained on non-EEG data or synthetic signals, can be successfully transferred to EEG tasks, showcasing the value of adopting cross-domain pretrained models for improving brain signal analysis.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

*J. Poole,N. Dervilis,K. Worden,P. Gardner,V. Giglioni,R. S. Mills,A. J. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenges of training SHM systems with limited labeled data by using domain adaptation and active sampling strategies in the PBSHM framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining labeled data for SHM systems is often costly and impractical, and this paper aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging data from related structures using PBSHM.

Method: A Bayesian framework for domain adaptation (DA) is proposed to improve mappings for SHM systems. This framework integrates an active sampling strategy to minimize required labeled data, guiding inspections to the most informative observations.

Result: The methodology was evaluated on experimental bridges, showing improved data efficiency in learning classification models within label-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: Combining transfer learning and active learning reduces the need for inspections and operational costs throughout the structure's lifetime, enhancing data-driven operation and maintenance strategies.

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

*Yuxiang Chen,Xiaoming Xu,Pengle Zhang,Michael Beyer,Martin Rapp,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TetraJet-v2, a method for efficient 4-bit fully-quantized training of LLMs, addressing challenges of weight oscillation and outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models in full precision is prohibitively expensive, and this paper aims to achieve efficient, low-precision training while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes a 4-bit training approach using NVFP4 format for activations, weights, and gradients, along with three techniques: unbiased double-block quantization, OsciReset, and OutControl.

Result: TetraJet-v2 reduces the performance gap to full-precision training by 51.3%, outperforming prior methods on LLM pretraining across different model and dataset sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates that low-precision training with 4-bit quantization can achieve competitive performance, addressing efficiency and scalability concerns in LLM training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

*Mohammad Zahangir Alam,Khandoker Ashik Uz Zaman,Mahdi H. Miraz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a tailored framework called AstuteRAG-FQA for Financial Question Answering using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, addressing challenges like proprietary dataset access, retrieval accuracy, and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome challenges of applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation in finance, including access to proprietary data, retrieval inaccuracies, and regulatory restrictions.

Method: It uses a hybrid retrieval strategy combining open-source and proprietary data, adapts prompts based on query complexity, and employs stringent security and compliance mechanisms.

Result: The framework systematically addresses different financial query types through task classification, contextual refinement, and data integration techniques.

Conclusion: AstuteRAG-FQA provides a secure, adaptive, and compliant solution to improving financial knowledge-intensive tasks using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

### [235] [ORGEval: Graph-Theoretic Evaluation of LLMs in Optimization Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27610)
*Zhuohan Wang,Ziwei Zhu,Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Yizhou Han,Yufeng Lin,Zhihang Lin,Angyang Gu,Xinglin Hu,Ruoyu Sun,Tian Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ORGEval, a graph-theoretic framework for evaluating LLMs' abilities in optimization modeling by leveraging graph isomorphism testing for model equivalence detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization modeling in industrial applications is labor-intensive and requires domain expertise. Although LLMs show potential for automation, the absence of robust evaluation metrics limits their practical use.

Method: The authors propose ORGEval, which uses graph-based representations of optimization models and performs equivalence detection via a tailored Weisfeiler-Lehman test combined with symmetry decomposition detection.

Result: ORGEval is robust to numerical variations, ensuring consistent detection results across random parameter configurations. Experimental benchmarks also showed significant runtime improvements compared to solver-based methods, especially for complex problems.

Conclusion: ORGEval provides an efficient and robust evaluation method for LLM-based optimization modeling. Benchmarking results reveal existing challenges for LLMs, though DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4 demonstrated leading accuracy under direct prompting.

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

### [236] [Panprediction: Optimal Predictions for Any Downstream Task and Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27638)
*Sivaraman Balakrishnan,Nika Haghtalab,Daniel Hsu,Brian Lee,Eric Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework called panprediction which extends the concept of supervised learning to optimize across many losses and tasks simultaneously. It establishes theoretical foundations and sample complexities for efficient learning in this paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in classical supervised learning by developing a framework enabling models to generalize across many losses and tasks, supporting versatile downstream applications.

Method: Introduces the concept of panprediction, derives statistical complexity results, and designs algorithms for deterministic and randomized panpredictors. Utilizes step calibration as a technical foundation for a nearly lossless reduction.

Result: Determine that under suitable conditions, optimizing infinitely many losses/tasks can be as statistically simple as optimizing one. Improves sample complexity of deterministic omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$ and matches other existing guarantees.

Conclusion: Panprediction offers a robust framework for generalizing predictions, significantly enhancing statistical learning efficiency across diverse tasks and losses compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses class imbalance in machine learning by using Explainable AI to detect and reduce Clever Hans (CH) effects, achieving competitive results on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance often leads to unreliable classification models, and existing approaches don't fully address the Clever Hans effects caused by underspecification in minority classes.

Method: The paper introduces an Explainable AI-based method that identifies and removes CH effects by leveraging counterfactual explanations to tackle class imbalance.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates competitive classification performance across three datasets and highlights how CH effects emerge due to class imbalance.

Conclusion: The study suggests that addressing CH effects with Explainable AI offers an effective alternative for handling class imbalance, providing insights that existing techniques may overlook.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective
largely overlooked by existing approaches.

### [238] [Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27651)
*Shuyan Lyu,Zhanzimo Wu,Junliang Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel layer-wise training method using deterministic information bottleneck to improve training efficiency and performance of CNNs without relying on backpropagation and cross-entropy, validated on datasets like CIFAR-10/100 and traffic sign recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deep neural network training with backpropagation is computationally costly, biologically implausible, and prone to issues like vanishing/exploding gradients. Layer-wise training provides a memory-efficient alternative but hasn't been tested extensively on large datasets or complex architectures.

Method: The authors utilize information-theoretic insights to design a layer-wise training approach based on deterministic information bottleneck and Rënuy's α-order entropy functional. Each CNN layer is trained with an auxiliary classifier connected directly to the network's output.

Result: The proposed training technique was validated empirically on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and traffic sign recognition tasks, outperforming existing layer-wise methods and achieving comparable results to standard SGD training.

Conclusion: Layer-wise training driven by information-theoretic principles provides an efficient and effective alternative to traditional end-to-end training, potentially reducing computational costs and improving scalability for deep CNNs.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

*Alireza Saleh Abadi,Leen-Kiat Soh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the challenges posed by openness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems, focusing on how it affects credit assignment problems (CAP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexities of openness in MARL systems, specifically the issues that arise in credit assignment due to dynamic agent populations, evolving tasks, and changing agent types.

Method: The authors perform a conceptual analysis of openness in MARL systems, introduce sub-categories of openness, and conduct empirical studies using representative algorithms in open environments.

Result: Openness in MARL systems causes credit misattribution, as demonstrated by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.

Conclusion: Dynamic systems in MARL require novel approaches for credit assignment to accommodate the challenges brought by openness and its impact on system performance.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.

*Sales G. Aribe Jr*

TL;DR: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer brain-inspired computation, energy efficiency, and dynamic operation. They match ANN accuracy but optimize energy and latency for neuromorphic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore SNNs as an energy- and latency-efficient alternative to ANNs in neuromorphic computing tasks.

Method: The paper investigates SNN design models, training approaches like surrogate gradient descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and training methods including STDP, as well as multiple performance metrics.

Result: Surrogate gradient-trained SNNs match ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), converted SNNs require higher spike counts but achieve strong performance, and STDP-based SNNs optimize energy and spike count at the cost of slower convergence.

Conclusion: SNNs demonstrate potential in energy-constrained and latency-sensitive applications, but hardware standardization and scalable training remain challenges. Further refinement is needed for broader adoption of neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the latest generation of neural
computation, offering a brain-inspired alternative to conventional Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals,
SNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more
energy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive
analysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional
performance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike
count, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient
descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP),
are examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs
closely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the
20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve
competitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation
windows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike
counts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making
them optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the
suitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive
applications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While
promising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable
training. This study concludes that SNNs, with further refinement, are poised
to propel the next phase of neuromorphic computing.

*Pengfei Sun,Jascha Achterberg,Zhe Su,Dan F. M. Goodman,Danyal Akarca*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper explores heterogeneous temporal delays in spiking neural networks, showing they enhance performance on time-sensitive problems and enable efficient computation even with low-precision weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models of neural networks primarily focus on optimizing synaptic weights, neglecting other parameters like delays, which the brain uses for asynchronous signal transmission.

Method: The study trained spiking neural networks to jointly optimize synaptic delays and weights under different levels of precision, including extremely low-precision weights, to evaluate their effect on temporal tasks.

Result: Heterogeneous delays significantly improved performance on complex temporal tasks, enabling state-of-the-art results even with highly compressed low-precision weights (e.g., 1.58-bit ternary precision).

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal heterogeneity is crucial for efficient computation, opening avenues for efficient neuromorphic systems that align with the complexities of real-world temporal dynamics.

Abstract: Neural networks rely on learning synaptic weights. However, this overlooks
other neural parameters that can also be learned and may be utilized by the
brain. One such parameter is the delay: the brain exhibits complex temporal
dynamics with heterogeneous delays, where signals are transmitted
asynchronously between neurons. It has been theorized that this delay
heterogeneity, rather than a cost to be minimized, can be exploited in embodied
contexts where task-relevant information naturally sits contextually in the
time domain. We test this hypothesis by training spiking neural networks to
modify not only their weights but also their delays at different levels of
precision. We find that delay heterogeneity enables state-of-the-art
performance on temporally complex neuromorphic problems and can be achieved
even when weights are extremely imprecise (1.58-bit ternary precision: just
positive, negative, or absent). By enabling high performance with extremely
low-precision weights, delay heterogeneity allows memory-efficient solutions
that maintain state-of-the-art accuracy even when weights are compressed over
an order of magnitude more aggressively than typically studied weight-only
networks. We show how delays and time-constants adaptively trade-off, and
reveal through ablation that task performance depends on task-appropriate delay
distributions, with temporally-complex tasks requiring longer delays. Our
results suggest temporal heterogeneity is an important principle for efficient
computation, particularly when task-relevant information is temporal - as in
the physical world - with implications for embodied intelligent systems and
neuromorphic hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed search space and optimization are effective in constructing high-performing network architectures for various image datasets.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural architecture search space using ResNet as a

pooling, fully connected layers, and connectivity of the residual network. In
addition to recognition accuracy, this paper uses the loss value on the

optimisation approach can find competitive network architectures on the MNIST,

*Marouane Benbetka,Merwan Bekkar,Riyadh Baghdadi,Martin Kong*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper presents a new algorithm for optimizing qubit mapping in quantum computing by leveraging the weight of transitive dependencies, achieving reduced circuit depth and SWAP gate count on tested platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qubit mapping is crucial in quantum compilation due to QPU constraints requiring adjacent qubits for two-qubit gates. This demands efficient management of SWAP gates to minimize quantum circuit errors and latency.

Method: A novel qubit mapping algorithm computes transitive dependencies in quantum circuits by modeling them with affine abstractions. This helps partition the circuits based on dependency distances and assign weighted layers for optimization.

Result: The algorithm shows improvements in circuit depth and SWAP gate count when tested on IBM and Rigetti QPUs using QUEKO and QASMBench benchmarks. It outperforms QMAP, Sabre, Cirq, and TKET in certain aspects while maintaining scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed qubit mapping algorithm effectively reduces circuit depth and SWAP gate usage by exploiting dependency information, showcasing its potential for enhancing quantum compilation processes.

Abstract: Qubit Mapping is a critical task in Quantum Compilation, as modern Quantum
Processing Units (QPUs) are constrained to nearest-neighbor interactions
defined by a qubit coupling graph. This compiler pass repairs the connectivity
of two-qubit gates whose operands are not adjacent by inserting SWAP gates that
move the state of qubits between directly connected qubits. Deciding when to
introduce SWAPs while minimizing their count is critical because the error in
quantum programs increases exponentially with the circuit latency, measured in
number of gates along the critical path of the circuit. Prior work for this
problem relied on heuristics and exact methods that partition the circuit into
two or more layers, but failed to exploit valuable dependence information in
any form.
  This paper introduces a novel qubit mapping algorithm based on the weight of
transitive dependences. The introduced mapper models quantum circuits with
affine abstractions thereby yielding the ability to compute transitive
dependences. In turn, the newfound information is used to partition circuits by
dependence distances and compute, efficiently, distinct weights for each layer.
We evaluate the efficiency of our mapper on IBM and Rigetti QPUs, using the
large datasets from the QUEKO and QASMBench benchmark suites, and against four
baseline tools (QMAP, Sabre, Cirq and TKET), demonstrating notable improvements
in circuit depth and swap count while delivering competitive scalability.

TL;DR: This paper studies forces generated by two types of microrobotic propulsors designed for swimming, measuring their thrust using a custom-built sensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the forces and thrust characteristics of insect-scale robotic propulsors that leverage fluid-structure interaction for efficient aquatic locomotion.

Method: Researchers developed theoretical models and gathered experimental data using a custom micro-N resolution force sensor to assess the thrusters’ performance.

Result: For the single-tail propulsor, maximum thrust was 0.45 mN and average force 2.97 micro-N. For the double-tail, maximum thrust was 0.61 mN and average force 22.6 micro-N.

Conclusion: The work provides the first detailed measurements and insights into thrust forces and FSI efficiency for microrobotic propulsion systems.

Abstract: We present force characterizations of two newly developed insect-scale
propulsors--one single-tailed and one double-tailed--for microrobotic swimmers
that leverage fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to generate thrust. The designs
of these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by
soft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory
alloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable
for microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures
for trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics
and magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.
In the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the
notion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization
using a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and
cycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and
2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail
propulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test
means of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively. These results represent the
first measurements of the instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale
propulsors of this type and provide insights into FSI for efficient
microrobotic propulsion.

*Jahir Argote-Gerald,Genki Miyauchi,Julian Rau,Paul Trodden,Roderich Gross*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm using a leader-switching mechanism, evaluated in simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its efficiency compared to other strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses challenges faced by multiple robots coordinating in maze-like environments, such as communication constraints and congestion.

Method: A distributed algorithm is developed using a leader-switching mechanism for maze traversal, evaluated via simulations and real-world experiments.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms naive strategies in makespan and sum-of-fuel, surpasses global communication approaches in makespan, but is inferior in sum-of-fuel. It is asymptotically equivalent to full-knowledge strategies for both metrics.

Conclusion: The algorithm is effective for multi-agent maze traversal, scalable to large groups, and validated through simulations and real-world robot experiments.

Abstract: Maze-like environments, such as cave and pipe networks, pose unique
challenges for multiple robots to coordinate, including communication
constraints and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a
distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be
represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one
agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the
other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to
neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a
single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in
simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple
single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive,
or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The
algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and
sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of
makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it
is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to
either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots
confirm the feasibility of the approach.

*Tim Windecker,Manthan Patel,Moritz Reuss,Richard Schwarzkopf,Cesar Cadena,Rudolf Lioutikov,Marco Hutter,Jonas Frey*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces NaviTrace, a visual question answering benchmark for evaluating vision-language models in robotic navigation systems to produce 2D navigation traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve evaluation methods for vision-language models integrating into robotic navigation, overcoming limitations like costly trials, simplified simulations, and few benchmarks.

Method: The benchmark includes 1000 scenarios with over 3000 expert traces, uses eight state-of-the-art vision-language models, and employs a semantic-aware trace score combining metrics like Dynamic Time Warping distance and goal endpoint error.

Result: The study reveals consistent limitations in models' spatial grounding and goal localization, with a noticeable gap between model and human performance.

Conclusion: NaviTrace provides a scalable, reproducible benchmark for assessing robotic navigation and highlights areas for improvement in vision-language model capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models demonstrate unprecedented performance and
generalization across a wide range of tasks and scenarios. Integrating these
foundation models into robotic navigation systems opens pathways toward
building general-purpose robots. Yet, evaluating these models' navigation
capabilities remains constrained by costly real-world trials, overly simplified
simulations, and limited benchmarks. We introduce NaviTrace, a high-quality
Visual Question Answering benchmark where a model receives an instruction and
embodiment type (human, legged robot, wheeled robot, bicycle) and must output a
2D navigation trace in image space. Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000
expert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a
newly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time
Warping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties
derived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our
evaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial
grounding and goal localization. NaviTrace establishes a scalable and
reproducible benchmark for real-world robotic navigation. The benchmark and

*Zachary Ravichandran,Fernando Cladera,Ankit Prabhu,Jason Hughes,Varun Murali,Camillo Taylor,George J. Pappas,Vijay Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPINE-HT is a framework enabling heterogeneous robot teams to succeed in complex missions by grounding large language model (LLM) reasoning in task feasibility, robot capabilities, and online feedback, demonstrating superior performance in simulated and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current LLM-enabled robot teaming methods in unstructured, open-world environments and enable effective collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams for complex missions.

Method: The framework employs a three-stage process: (1) generating grounded subtasks via LLMs based on language-specified goals and capabilities, (2) validating subtask feasibility, and (3) assigning and refining subtasks through feedback during operation.

Result: SPINE-HT achieved twice the success rate in simulation compared to prior approaches and an 87% success rate in real-world experiments involving diverse robots and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: SPINE-HT effectively leverages LLMs for reasoning and adaptation, enabling heterogeneous robot teams to accomplish missions in uncertain and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must
accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to
information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in
unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps
-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.
While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed
specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can
accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,
current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume
well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured
environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations
by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous
robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications
describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded
subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to
robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined
given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments
with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice
the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming
approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath
Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an
87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and
refining subtasks with online feedback. More information is provided at

### [250] [RepV: Safety-Separable Latent Spaces for Scalable Neurosymbolic Plan Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26935)
*Yunhao Yang,Neel P. Bhatt,Pranay Samineni,Rohan Siva,Zhanyang Wang,Ufuk Topcu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier that ensures AI systems' actions adhere to rules by learning a safety-separating latent space. It enhances compliance verification accuracy and facilitates rule compliance refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in safety-critical domains need reliable verification methods to ensure actions comply with defined rules. Existing formal methods are precise but inflexible, and deep learning systems lack transparency and may misclassify, with serious consequences.

Method: RepV combines formal methods and deep learning by training a lightweight latent space to separate safe and unsafe plans. It embeds language-model-generated rationales and trains with a small labeled dataset, using a frozen linear boundary for natural-language rule compliance verification.

Result: RepV improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baselines with minimal computational resource increase and supports effective refinement of planners for better rule adherence.

Conclusion: Safety-separable latent spaces, as proposed by RepV, provide a scalable and robust solution for reliable neurosymbolic verification of AI planning, with potential for broad application in rule-critical domains.

Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their
actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods
provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic
specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep
learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language
constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with
potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier
that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans
are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an
off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds
each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a
low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for
unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the
likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.
This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving
rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV
improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline
methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement
framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning
domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a
scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for pipe inspection, protecting internal components while offering visual condition assessment and mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many industrial pipes require efficient inspection and condition assessment to ensure functionality and repair aging systems. Current solutions for navigating into pipe interiors, particularly confined and sinuous paths, prove inadequate due to system complexity and lack of real-world validation.

Method: The proposed system integrates mechanical and electrical components within a transparent, airtight soft robot body. It includes a passively adapting enclosed tip mount for transporting sensors and undergoes real-world testing in a wastewater pipe.

Result: The system successfully performed a real-world pipe inspection and mapping task, demonstrating robust capabilities for condition assessments.

Conclusion: This study advances vine robot technology for industrial applications by proving its feasibility for streamlined, effective pipe inspection and mapping in challenging environments.

Abstract: Rehabilitation of aging pipes requires accurate condition assessment and
mapping far into the pipe interiors. Soft growing vine robot systems are
particularly promising for navigating confined, sinuous paths such as in pipes,
but are currently limited by complex subsystems and a lack of validation in
real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we introduce the concept and
implementation of a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for visual
condition assessment and mapping within non-branching pipes. This design
encloses all mechanical and electrical components within the vine robot's soft,
airtight, and transparent body, protecting them from environmental interference
while enabling visual sensing. Because this approach requires an enclosed
mechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a
passively adapting enclosed tip mount. Finally, we validated the hermetic and
transparent vine robot system concept through a real-world condition assessment
and mapping task in a wastewater pipe. This work advances the use of
soft-growing vine robots in pipe inspection by developing and demonstrating a
robust, streamlined, field-validated system suitable for continued development
and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning in robotics due to implicit reasoning and reliance on only image data.

Method: The framework integrates neural perception (detecting entities, extracting attributes) with symbolic reasoning (structured scene graphs) for explicit spatial and logical relationships.

Result: Evaluation on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset shows enhanced performance and reliability in complex, crowded environments.

Conclusion: This lightweight approach improves spatial reasoning in robotics and embodied AI applications while achieving interpretable and precise results.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive
task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions
within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing
vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with
fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven
reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic
framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,
combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial
and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for
detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that
constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.
Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior
performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while
maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI
applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents SpikeATac, a multimodal tactile finger for improved touch sensing and dexterity in robotic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance tactile sensing and enable delicate manipulation tasks with robotic systems, specifically for fragile objects.

Method: The authors combined a PVDF-based dynamic tactile sensing with a static capacitive method and integrated it into a robotic system with reinforcement learning from human feedback.

Result: SpikeATac demonstrated high sensitivity to touch with capabilities to gently and effectively manipulate fragile objects via in-hand manipulation on a multi-fingered robotic hand.

Conclusion: SpikeATac advances the field of robotic dexterity and touch, achieving previously unrealized tasks in handling delicate objects, enabled by its multimodal sensing and learning approach.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SpikeATac, a multimodal tactile finger combining a
taxelized and highly sensitive dynamic response (PVDF) with a static
transduction method (capacitive) for multimodal touch sensing. Named for its
`spiky' response, SpikeATac's 16-taxel PVDF film sampled at 4 kHz provides
fast, sensitive dynamic signals to the very onset and breaking of contact. We
characterize the sensitivity of the different modalities, and show that
SpikeATac provides the ability to stop quickly and delicately when grasping
fragile, deformable objects. Beyond parallel grasping, we show that SpikeATac
can be used in a learning-based framework to achieve new capabilities on a
dexterous multifingered robot hand. We use a learning recipe that combines
reinforcement learning from human feedback with tactile-based rewards to
fine-tune the behavior of a policy to modulate force. Our hardware platform and
learning pipeline together enable a difficult dexterous and contact-rich task
that has not previously been achieved: in-hand manipulation of fragile objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method, Dynamics-Aligned Flow Matching Policy (DAP), which enhances behavior cloning in robotics by integrating dynamics prediction into policy learning to improve task generalization, especially in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the generalization of behavior cloning methods in robot learning, which traditionally suffer from limitations in data support and cannot distinguish between different control inputs, especially in the context of precise manipulation tasks.

Method: The DAP method introduces a novel architecture wherein the policy and dynamics models provide mutual corrective feedback. This integration helps in addressing the shortcomings of action-agnostic dynamics, thus improving action precision and self-correction.

Result: The empirical results demonstrate superior generalization performance of DAP compared to baseline methods. It has shown particular robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios such as visual distractions and lighting variations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating dynamics prediction with policy learning enhances generalization for robotic manipulation tasks, especially in complex and dynamic real-world scenarios, and outperforms baseline approaches in such cases.

Abstract: Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization
due to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches
leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning
rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these
models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different
control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and
requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow
Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning.
Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models
provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling
self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates
generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic
manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including
visual distractions and lighting variations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Collaborative Aquatic Positioning (CAP) system to enhance accuracy in underwater robot localization in confined environments, achieving a 70 mm mean error without needing extensive infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater robot positioning remains challenging in industrial and constrained environments due to poor coverage, infrastructure reliance, and multipath effects, creating a bottleneck in autonomous deployment.

Method: A Collaborative Aquatic Positioning (CAP) system incorporating sensor fusion and collaborative robotics, where a surface vehicle assists submerged robots with localization inspired by the 'mother-ship' concept.

Result: Experimental validation was conducted in a controlled environment, achieving a mean Euclidean distance error of 70 mm in real time without relying on fixed infrastructure or environmental features.

Conclusion: CAP significantly improves underwater localization accuracy, offering practical, infrastructure-free deployment for autonomous missions in confined and complex spaces.

Abstract: Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a
key challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for
large, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor
coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich
surroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further
degrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily
deployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;
however, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting
underwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic
Positioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor
fusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the "mother-ship" concept,
the surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a
submerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly
constrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through
repeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time
trajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance
(MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed
infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages
advances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step
change in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.

Method: The study proposes a self-reconfigurable system (MobiDock) using autonomous docking with computer vision and a threaded screw-lock mechanism to physically connect two robots into one unified system.

Result: The docked system outperformed independent robots, with benefits including lower RMS acceleration and jerk, higher angular precision, and faster task completion.

Conclusion: Physical reconfiguration simplifies cooperative control and enhances real-world task performance for multi-robot systems by improving dynamic stability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems, particularly mobile manipulators, face challenges in
control coordination and dynamic stability when working together. To address
this issue, this study proposes MobiDock, a modular self-reconfigurable mobile
manipulator system that allows two independent robots to physically connect and
form a unified mobile bimanual platform. This process helps transform a complex
multi-robot control problem into the management of a simpler, single system.
The system utilizes an autonomous docking strategy based on computer vision
with AprilTag markers and a new threaded screw-lock mechanism. Experimental
results show that the docked configuration demonstrates better performance in
dynamic stability and operational efficiency compared to two independently
cooperating robots. Specifically, the unified system has lower Root Mean Square
(RMS) Acceleration and Jerk values, higher angular precision, and completes
tasks significantly faster. These findings confirm that physical
reconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative
control, improving stability and performance for complex tasks in real-world

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid robotic gripper finger that enhances safe handling of diverse objects by modulating surface friction rather than applying excessive grip forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots face challenges in securely grasping objects with varying mechanical properties, such as slipperiness or fragility, without causing damage.

Method: The hybrid gripper finger combines a rigid structure and an inflatable silicone pocket, controlling friction through adjustable air pressure.

Result: Experimental tests reveal that increasing air pressure proportionally boosts surface friction, enabling safe handling of fragile and deformable objects.

Conclusion: The adaptable friction mechanism enhances gripper safety and versatility in handling a wide range of delicate or robust objects.

Abstract: Grasping objects with diverse mechanical properties, such as heavy, slippery,
or fragile items, remains a significant challenge in robotics. Conventional
grippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to
objects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that
combines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The
gripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the
internal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental
experiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a
proportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables
the gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the
gripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,
fruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than
applying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid
gripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative
to relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper
flexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vectorized Online POMDP Planner (VOPP), a novel solver for POMDP problems that significantly improves computation efficiency through vectorized parallel computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of planning under partial observability for autonomous robots, leveraging massive hardware parallelization while overcoming synchronization bottlenecks in existing POMDP solvers.

Method: Propose VOPP, which uses a recent POMDP formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization process, representing planning data as tensors and performing computations in a fully vectorized manner.

Result: Experimental results show VOPP is 20 times more efficient than current state-of-the-art parallel POMDP solvers in computing near-optimal solutions.

Conclusion: VOPP successfully eliminates dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks, demonstrating its capability for efficient parallel computation in complex planning under partial observability.

Abstract: Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous
robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a
powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing
the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through
noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive
parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been
challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with
the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization
bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of
parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner
(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP
formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,
leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP
represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors
and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this
representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies
and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental
results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing
near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online
solver.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a new metric, MEI, for evaluating lateral conflicts in autonomous driving, surpassing the accuracy of existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current criticality metrics struggle with accurately assessing lateral conflicts, common in urban driving scenarios.

Method: Introduced the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI) to better quantify evasive efforts in lateral conflicts and validated it using public traffic datasets.

Result: MEI shows improved evaluation performance compared to existing metrics like PET and ACT, demonstrating enhanced risk quantification capabilities.

Conclusion: MEI offers a reliable metric for assessing lateral urban driving conflicts and contributes to advancing autonomous driving safety evaluation systems.

Abstract: Effective, reliable, and efficient evaluation of autonomous driving safety is
essential to demonstrate its trustworthiness. Criticality metrics provide an
objective means of assessing safety. However, as existing metrics primarily
target longitudinal conflicts, accurately quantifying the risks of lateral
conflicts - prevalent in urban settings - remains challenging. This paper
proposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify
evasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index
(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,
enabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral
conflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500
high-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events. MEI is
then compared with the well-established ACT and the widely used PET metrics.
Results show that MEI consistently outperforms them in accurately quantifying
criticality and capturing risk evolution. Overall, these findings highlight MEI
as a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety
assessment framework for autonomous driving. The open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/AutoChengh/MEI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-embodiment grasping struggle with implicit learning of kinematic structure and require large-scale data, making it challenging to adapt to diverse grippers.

Method: The proposed approach uses a flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis model that is implemented entirely in JAX, incorporating batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and grasps for improved learning and performance.

Result: The method demonstrates improved performance, smoother learning, and faster inference when handling grippers with variable degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: This research successfully introduces a data-efficient grasp synthesis framework capable of handling diverse grippers by leveraging gripper and scene geometry while enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Multi-embodiment grasping focuses on developing approaches that exhibit
generalist behavior across diverse gripper designs. Existing methods often
learn the kinematic structure of the robot implicitly and face challenges due
to the difficulty of sourcing the required large-scale data. In this work, we
present a data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture
that can handle different gripper types with variable degrees of freedom and
successfully exploit the underlying kinematic model, deducing all necessary
information solely from the gripper and scene geometry. Unlike previous
equivariant grasping methods, we translated all modules from the ground up to
JAX and provide a model with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and
grasps, resulting in smoother learning, improved performance and faster
inference time. Our dataset encompasses grippers ranging from humanoid hands to
parallel yaw grippers and includes 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.

### [262] [Learning Soft Robotic Dynamics with Active Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27428)
*Hehui Zheng,Bhavya Sukhija,Chenhao Li,Klemens Iten,Andreas Krause,Robert K. Katzschmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes SoftAE, a framework utilizing uncertainty-aware active exploration to autonomously learn generalizable dynamics models for soft robots, yielding superior performance and robustness across various platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of modeling soft robots, which have high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics, for better control, while improving limitations in existing data-driven approaches such as lack of generalization and inefficiency.

Method: The proposed method, SoftAE, uses probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and actively guides exploration to less represented areas of state-action space, enabling task-agnostic dynamic model learning.

Result: SoftAE demonstrated superior dynamics models, zero-shot control performance on unseen tasks, and robustness against challenges like sensing noise and actuation delays in simulations and real-world tests compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: SoftAE represents a significant advancement in enabling scalable, adaptable, and data-efficient autonomous control for a variety of soft robotic systems.

Abstract: Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured
environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics
make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven
approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task
demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an
uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns
task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE
employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and
actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action
space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific
supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a
continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with
hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the
real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based
reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables
superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under
sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results
demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,
reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing
a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in
compliant robots.

*Tomoko Yonezawa,Hirotake Yamazoe,Atsuo Fujino,Daigo Suhara,Takaya Tamamoto,Yuto Nishiguchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper investigates designing robot behaviors for rejecting human approaches, using discomfort models and the PAD affect framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-robot interaction requires robots to appropriately respond to physical proximity, like humans do in various relationships and contexts.

Method: Models discomfort accumulation and decay based on interpersonal distances using the PAD affect framework. Implemented tolerance and avoidance behaviors on an arm robot.

Result: Robot behaviors showcase graded endurance motions and limit-exceeding avoidance responses based on discomfort thresholds.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a coherent connection between a robot’s internal state parameters and its physical responses to human proximity.

Abstract: Human-robot interaction frequently involves physical proximity or contact. In
human-human settings, people flexibly accept, reject, or tolerate such
approaches depending on the relationship and context. We explore the design of
a robot's rejective internal state and corresponding avoidance behaviors, such
as withdrawing or pushing away, when a person approaches. We model the
accumulation and decay of discomfort as a function of interpersonal distance,
and implement tolerance (endurance) and limit-exceeding avoidance driven by the
Dominance axis of the PAD affect model. The behaviors and their intensities are
realized on an arm robot. Results illustrate a coherent pipeline from internal
state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to
avoidance actions.

*Travis Davies,Yiqi Huang,Alexi Gladstone,Yunxin Liu,Xiang Chen,Heng Ji,Huxian Liu,Luhui Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents EBT-Policy, an Energy-Based Model (EBM) designed to outperform diffusion-based policies in robotics tasks, with fewer computational requirements and novel features like zero-shot recovery from failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges of computational cost, exposure bias, unstable inference dynamics, and divergence under distribution shifts faced by current implicit policies in robotics.

Method: The authors propose EBT-Policy, an energy-based architecture building upon Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs), capable of robust and efficient policy learning for robotics tasks.

Result: EBT-Policy outperformed diffusion-based policies in both simulated and real-world tasks, requiring significantly less computation and demonstrating emergent capabilities like zero-shot failure recovery.

Conclusion: EBT-Policy is a scalable and robust alternative for robotic policy learning, demonstrating generalizability and effective performance under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion
Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead
to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address
these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium
dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies
parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent
work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs
to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in
physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new
energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and
real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy
consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less
training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges
within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's
100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior
models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only
behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar
energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,
EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior
under distribution shifts.

*Dong Heon Han,Xiaohao Xu,Yuxi Chen,Yusheng Zhou,Xinqi Zhang,Jiaqi Wang,Daniel Bruder,Xiaonan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a modular soft gripper inspired by biological systems, capable of whole-body morphing and diverse object manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological systems like octopuses excel in manipulating objects by reconfiguring their entire form, a capability absent in conventional robotic systems.

Method: The authors developed a modular soft gripper composed of self-sensing pneumatic actuators and embedded sensors capable of adaptive reconfiguration and forming diverse polygonal shapes.

Result: The gripper experimentally demonstrated enhanced manipulation capabilities, including expanded grasping envelope, adaptability across various objects, and novel manipulation modes such as multi-object grasping.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable, cost-effective framework that blends distributed actuation with integrated sensing, potentially bridging the gap between biological and robotic dexterity.

Abstract: Biological systems, such as the octopus, exhibit masterful cross-scale
manipulation by adaptively reconfiguring their entire form, a capability that
remains elusive in robotics. Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are
mostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing
efforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to
replicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we
introduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,
realized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed
network of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to
intelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing
states that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating
rich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly
transition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally
demonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances
generalization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and
scales (up to 10$\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities
such as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,
easy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with
integrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels
of dexterity in robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper reviews current practices in evaluating quantum, quantum-inspired, and hybrid optimization algorithms for software engineering problems and identifies gaps, providing insights for better empirical study designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum-related algorithms have potential in optimizing software engineering problems, but there is a lack of standardized empirical evaluation protocols.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic analysis based on primary studies from a recent systematic literature review, examining aspects such as experimental design, metrics, and real-world application gaps.

Result: The study identified shortcomings in current practices, such as limited experiment reporting, inadequate noise handling, and lack of standardized metrics, especially quantum-specific ones.

Conclusion: The paper offers guidelines for enhancing empirical studies and emphasizes the need for real-world case studies to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and practicality of these algorithms.

Abstract: In recent years, quantum, quantum-inspired, and hybrid algorithms are
increasingly showing promise for solving software engineering optimization
problems. However, best-intended practices for conducting empirical studies
have not yet well established. In this paper, based on the primary studies
identified from the latest systematic literature review on quantum optimization
for software engineering problems, we conducted a systematic analysis on these
studies from various aspects including experimental designs, hyperparameter
settings, case studies, baselines, tooling, and metrics. We identify key gaps
in the current practices such as limited reporting of the number of
repetitions, number of shots, and inadequate consideration of noise handling,
as well as a lack of standardized evaluation protocols such as the adoption of
quality metrics, especially quantum-specific metrics. Based on our analysis, we
provide insights for designing empirical studies and highlight the need for
more real-world and open case studies to assess cost-effectiveness and
practical utility of the three types of approaches: quantum-inspired, quantum,
and hybrid. This study is intended to offer an overview of current practices
and serve as an initial reference for designing and conducting empirical
studies on evaluating and comparing quantum, quantum-inspired, and hybrid
algorithms in solving optimization problems in software engineering.

*Jieshan Chen,Suyu Ma,Qinghua Lu,Sung Une Lee,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a marginal risk assessment framework to compare AI systems with existing ones without relying on ground truth, addressing risks and improvements. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a practical method for assessing AI systems against incumbents when ground truth comparisons are unavailable or unreliable, ensuring better outcomes and reduced risk.

Method: The proposed method uses a marginal risk assessment framework emphasizing relative evaluation methodologies: predictability, capability, and interaction dominance.

Result: This approach allows developers to identify where AI systems enhance outcomes, introduce risks, or enable responsible adoption without relying on traditional absolute risk measures.

Conclusion: The framework equips software teams with actionable insights on comparing AI systems to incumbents, promoting safety and effectiveness in deployment.

Abstract: Before deploying an AI system to replace an existing process, it must be
compared with the incumbent to ensure improvement without added risk.
Traditional evaluation relies on ground truth for both systems, but this is
often unavailable due to delayed or unknowable outcomes, high costs, or
incomplete data, especially for long-standing systems deemed safe by
convention. The more practical solution is not to compute absolute risk but the
difference between systems. We therefore propose a marginal risk assessment
framework, that avoids dependence on ground truth or absolute risk. It
emphasizes three kinds of relative evaluation methodology, including
predictability, capability and interaction dominance. By shifting focus from
absolute to relative evaluation, our approach equips software teams with
actionable guidance: identifying where AI enhances outcomes, where it
introduces new risks, and how to adopt such systems responsibly.

TL;DR: BPMN-ProX is a low-code testing framework enhancing verification for data-aware business process models by employing advanced verification and integrating data handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business process models lack formal characterization, which limits their verification despite their wide usage in industry and academia.

Method: Introduces BPMN-ProX, a framework integrating data handling and state-of-the-art model checkers for low-code testing.

Result: Provides an agile, reliable, and user-centric tool for verifying data-aware BPMN models.

Conclusion: BPMN-ProX bridges technical gaps by combining theoretical verification with practical modeling for better business process management solutions.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the verification of
business process models. Despite their lack of formal characterization, these
models are widely adopted in both industry and academia. To address this issue,
formalizing the execution semantics of business process modeling languages is
essential. Since data and process are two facets of the same coin, and data are
critical elements in the execution of process models, this work introduces
Proving an eXecutable BPMN injected with data, BPMN-ProX. BPMN-ProX is a
low-code testing framework that significantly enhances the verification of
data-aware BPMN. This low-code platform helps bridge the gap between
non-technical experts and professionals by proposing a tool that integrates
advanced data handling and employs a robust verification mechanism through
state-of-the-art model checkers. This innovative approach combines theoretical
verification with practical modeling, fostering more agile, reliable, and
user-centric business process management.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SparseAlign, a framework for assessing Large Language Models as a Judge (LaaJs) alignment with sparse human-labeled data. It aims to enhance reliability of such models in evaluating legacy language outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to modernize applications built in legacy languages like COBOL, but there is a shortage of expert evaluators and quality human-annotated evaluation data. Automatic judges (LaaJs) can assist but require validation to avoid reinforcing unreliable assessments.

Method: SparseAlign provides a framework incorporating pairwise-confidence and a score-sensitive alignment metric to assess ranking consistency and score proximity, ensuring reliable evaluator selection with limited annotated examples.

Result: The framework was applied to select evaluators for COBOL code explanations, integrating top-performing ones into workflows for model release decisions, thereby validating SparseAlign's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SparseAlign demonstrates utility in selecting reliable evaluators even with limited human-labeled data, mitigating risks in LaaJ-dependent evaluation processes for legacy application modernization workflows.

Abstract: Application modernization in legacy languages such as COBOL, PL/I, and REXX
faces an acute shortage of resources, both in expert availability and in
high-quality human evaluation data. While Large Language Models as a Judge
(LaaJ) offer a scalable alternative to expert review, their reliability must be
validated before being trusted in high-stakes workflows. Without principled
validation, organizations risk a circular evaluation loop, where unverified
LaaJs are used to assess model outputs, potentially reinforcing unreliable
judgments and compromising downstream deployment decisions. Although various
automated approaches to validating LaaJs have been proposed, alignment with
human judgment remains a widely used and conceptually grounded validation
strategy. In many real-world domains, the availability of human-labeled
evaluation data is severely limited, making it difficult to assess how well a
LaaJ aligns with human judgment. We introduce SparseAlign, a formal framework
for assessing LaaJ alignment with sparse human-labeled data. SparseAlign
combines a novel pairwise-confidence concept with a score-sensitive alignment
metric that jointly capture ranking consistency and score proximity, enabling
reliable evaluator selection even when traditional statistical methods are
ineffective due to limited annotated examples. SparseAlign was applied
internally to select LaaJs for COBOL code explanation. The top-aligned
evaluators were integrated into assessment workflows, guiding model release
decisions. We present a case study of four LaaJs to demonstrate SparseAlign's
utility in real-world evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the evolving software and electric/electronic architecture needed for Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs). It proposes a concept for hardware- and platform-agnostic application development and integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The automotive industry's shift toward more integrated and complex E/E and software architectures requires efficient, platform-agnostic application development to manage heterogeneous environments.

Method: The approach involves developing hardware- and software-agnostic applications, standardizing interfaces, describing applications in machine-readable formats, and creating tools for semi-automated development and integration.

Result: The concept was validated with an example application integrated onto AUTOSAR Adaptive and ROS 2 platforms, demonstrating applicability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed concept enables efficient development and integration of software applications regardless of hardware or platform, supporting the industry transformation to SDVs.

Abstract: The automotive industry is currently undergoing a major transformation with
respect to the Electric/Electronic (E/E) and software architecture, driven by a
significant increase in the complexity of the technological stack within a
vehicle. This complexity acts as a driving force for Software-Defined Vehicles
(SDVs) leading to the evolution of the automotive E/E architectures from
decentralized configuration comprising multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs)
towards a more integrated configuration comprising a smaller number of ECUs,
domain controllers, gateways, and High-Performance Computers (HPCs) [2]. This
transition along with several other reasons have resulted in heterogeneous
software platforms such as AUTOSAR Classic, AUTOSAR Adaptive, and prototypical
frameworks like ROS 2. It is therefore essential to develop applications that
are both hardware- and platform/middleware-agnostic to attain development and
integration efficiency. This work presents an application development and
integration concept to facilitate developing applications as Software as a
Product (SaaP), while simultaneously ensuring efficient integration onto
multiple software architecture platforms. The concept involves designing
applications in a hardware- and software platform-agnostic manner and
standardizing application interfaces [6]. It also includes describing the
relevant aspects of the application and corresponding middleware in a
machine-readable format to aid the integration of developed applications.
Additionally, tools are developed to facilitate semi-automation of the
development and integration processes. An example application has been
developed and integrated onto AUTOSAR Adaptive and ROS 2, demonstrating the
applicability of the approach. Finally, metrics are presented to show the
efficiency of the overall concept.

Motivation: To address the challenge of designing effective, automated test cases for REST APIs in complex cloud native systems, which is often resource-intensive.

Method: The study evaluated single and multi-agent LLM configurations across four cloud applications to amplify test suites, analyzing their overall performance and trade-offs.

Result: LLM-driven systems increased API endpoint and parameter coverage, revealing defects while ensuring semantic validity with limited manual effort.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively automate REST API test amplification, improving reliability, scalability, and sustainability of testing in cloud environments while balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a cornerstone of modern cloud
native systems. Ensuring their reliability demands automated test suites that
exercise diverse and boundary level behaviors. Nevertheless, designing such
test cases remains a challenging and resource intensive endeavor. This study
extends prior work on Large Language Model (LLM) based test amplification by
evaluating single agent and multi agent configurations across four additional
cloud applications. The amplified test suites maintain semantic validity with
minimal human intervention. The results demonstrate that agentic LLM systems
can effectively generalize across heterogeneous API architectures, increasing
endpoint and parameter coverage while revealing defects. Moreover, a detailed
analysis of computational cost, runtime, and energy consumption highlights
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. These findings
underscore the potential of LLM driven test amplification to advance the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for code-generating language models overlook the diversity of real-world coding tasks and developers' expectations, motivating the need for a comprehensive and extensible evaluation framework.

Method: The proposed benchmark evaluates models on adherence to constraints and the refinement based on follow-up instructions. It utilizes coding tasks from LiveBench, translated across Python, Java, and JavaScript.

Result: The evaluation uncovered varying performance levels of models in instruction-following across dimensions, languages, and task requirements.

Conclusion: The benchmarking pipeline provides a holistic evaluation of code generation models, demonstrating their capabilities and limitations, and enabling broader assessments of their instruction-following capabilities across programming languages.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable of generating code,
evaluating their performance remains a complex and evolving challenge. Existing
benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, overlooking the diversity
of real-world coding tasks and developer expectations. To this end, we
introduce a multi-language benchmark that evaluates LLM instruction-following
capabilities and is extensible to operate on any set of standalone coding
problems. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following in two key settings:
adherence to pre-defined constraints specified with the initial problem, and
the ability to perform refinements based on follow-up instructions. For this
paper's analysis, we empirically evaluated our benchmarking pipeline with
programming tasks from LiveBench, that are also automatically translated from
Python into Java and JavaScript. Our automated benchmark reveals that models
exhibit differing levels of performance across multiple dimensions of
instruction-following. Our benchmarking pipeline provides a more comprehensive
evaluation of code generation models, highlighting their strengths and
limitations across languages and generation goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing integration of machine learning in software systems to enhance decision-making, but this creates challenges in variability management within software product lines.

Method: The paper introduces a structured framework that extends Software Product Line engineering to incorporate machine learning components, focusing on modeling and managing variability.

Result: The proposed framework has been partially implemented using the VariaMos tool to enable systematic modeling and reuse in SPLs with ML capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework represents a step towards addressing the complexity of integrating machine learning into software product lines, aiding in variability management and reuse.

Abstract: Modern software systems increasingly integrate machine learning (ML) due to
its advancements and ability to enhance data-driven decision-making. However,
this integration introduces significant challenges for software engineering,
especially in software product lines (SPLs), where managing variability and
reuse becomes more complex with the inclusion of ML components. Although
existing approaches have addressed variability management in SPLs and the
integration of ML components in isolated systems, few have explored the
intersection of both domains. Specifically, there is limited support for
modeling and managing variability in SPLs that incorporate ML components. To
bridge this gap, this article proposes a structured framework designed to
extend Software Product Line engineering, facilitating the integration of ML
components. It facilitates the design of SPLs with ML capabilities by enabling
systematic modeling of variability and reuse. The proposal has been partially
implemented with the VariaMos tool.

TL;DR: The paper investigates improving Large Language Models (LLMs) by selecting optimal few-shot examples for in-context learning aimed at identifying code vulnerabilities, using two key selection criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM performance in detecting code vulnerabilities, a challenging task, by optimizing the effectiveness of examples provided during in-context learning (ICL).

Method: The study tests two criteria for selecting few-shot examples: (1) evaluating if LLMs perform consistently on particular samples, and (2) choosing examples based on their similarity to the query (k-nearest neighbors). Evaluations are conducted using open-source models on multiple datasets.

Result: Results show the advantage of using either criterion and various combinations to enhance LLM accuracy on code vulnerability detection tasks.

Conclusion: Selecting appropriate few-shot examples is crucial for leveraging in-context learning to improve LLM performance in complex tasks like code vulnerability detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for
many coding tasks, including summarization, translation, completion, and code
generation. However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task
for LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning
(ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct
answers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However,
choosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model
performance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot
examples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first
criterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a
sample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about
its usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity
of the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples
based on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations
to determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under
various combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.

Motivation: To extend AI-assisted formal verification from single functions to entire complex data structure modules efficiently.

Method: VeriStruct includes a planner module for systematic generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code while addressing syntax misunderstandings with embedded guidance and a repair mechanism.

Result: VeriStruct evaluated eleven Rust data structure modules, successfully verifying 128 of 129 functions, achieving a 99.2% success rate.

Conclusion: VeriStruct significantly advances AI-assisted automated verification, marking a step toward broader, reliable formal verification of complex systems.

Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated
verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in
Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic
generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To
address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax
and verification-specific semantics, VeriStruct embeds syntax guidance within
prompts and includes a repair stage to automatically correct annotation errors.
In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on
ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in
total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic

### [277] [EARS-UDE: Evaluating Auditory Response in Sensory Overload with Universal Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26804)
*Miheer Salunke,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Auditory overload in autism is studied using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), which integrate biophysical models and neural networks, achieving better accuracy and fewer parameters compared to Neural ODEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to account for autism heterogeneity and lack interpretability in modeling sensory overload. A new approach combining biophysical and machine learning methods is needed.

Method: The study applies Scientific Machine Learning using Universal Differential Equations to model sensory adaptation dynamics in autism, incorporating neural networks and ordinary differential equations.

Result: UDEs outperform Neural ODEs by 90.8% in accuracy while using 73.5% fewer parameters, and predict sensory overload risk at 17.2% for specific stimuli.

Conclusion: The framework provides precise physiological parameter recovery and actionable insights for personalized interventions, with applications in technology and clinical settings.

Abstract: Auditory sensory overload affects 50-70% of individuals with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD), yet existing approaches, such as mechanistic models (Hodgkin
Huxley type, Wilson Cowan, excitation inhibition balance), clinical tools
(EEG/MEG, Sensory Profile scales), and ML methods (Neural ODEs, predictive
coding), either assume fixed parameters or lack interpretability, missing
autism heterogeneity. We present a Scientific Machine Learning approach using
Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to model sensory adaptation dynamics in
autism. Our framework combines ordinary differential equations grounded in
biophysics with neural networks to capture both mechanistic understanding and
individual variability. We demonstrate that UDEs achieve a 90.8% improvement
over pure Neural ODEs while using 73.5% fewer parameters. The model
successfully recovers physiological parameters within the 2% error and provides
a quantitative risk assessment for sensory overload, predicting 17.2% risk for
pulse stimuli with specific temporal patterns. This framework establishes
foundations for personalized, evidence-based interventions in autism, with
direct applications to wearable technology and clinical practice.

*Joshua L. Pughe-Sanford,Xuehao Ding,Jason J. Moore,Anirvan M. Sengupta,Charles Epstein,Philip Greengard,Dmitri B. Chklovskii*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper models sensory neurons as self-supervised learners identifying coherent dynamic regions, with methods like spectral clustering and canonical correlation analysis enabling this biologically plausible representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how sensory neurons compactly represent high-dimensional dynamic systems to process stimuli. Exploring how neurons detect coherent sets in stimulus space and assign membership indices.

Method: Utilizes spectral clustering of stochastic Koopman operator and canonical correlation analysis on lag-vector representations for identifying coherent sets in sensory dynamics.

Result: Coherent sets of stimuli are identified, categorized into predictive and retrospective sets, demonstrating a functional dichotomy among sensory neurons. Singular vectors estimated from prior data allow biologically plausible computations.

Conclusion: Coherent-set clustering is fundamental to sensory processing, explaining temporal filtering, neuronal dichotomies, and rectification. The framework also inspires bio-inspired artificial systems.

Abstract: We model sensory streams as observations from high-dimensional stochastic
dynamical systems and conceptualize sensory neurons as self-supervised learners
of compact representations of such dynamics. From prior experience, neurons
learn coherent sets-regions of stimulus state space whose trajectories evolve
cohesively over finite times-and assign membership indices to new stimuli.
Coherent sets are identified via spectral clustering of the stochastic Koopman
operator (SKO), where the sign pattern of a subdominant singular function
partitions the state space into minimally coupled regions. For multivariate
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, this singular function reduces to a linear
projection onto the dominant singular vector of the whitened state-transition
matrix. Encoding this singular vector as a receptive field enables neurons to
compute membership indices via the projection sign in a biologically plausible
manner. Each neuron detects either a predictive coherent set (stimuli with
common futures) or a retrospective coherent set (stimuli with common pasts),
suggesting a functional dichotomy among neurons. Since neurons lack access to
explicit dynamical equations, the requisite singular vectors must be estimated
directly from data, for example, via past-future canonical correlation analysis
on lag-vector representations-an approach that naturally extends to nonlinear
dynamics. This framework provides a novel account of neuronal temporal
filtering, the ubiquity of rectification in neural responses, and known
functional dichotomies. Coherent-set clustering thus emerges as a fundamental
computation underlying sensory processing and transferable to bio-inspired
artificial systems.

### [279] [A Sensing Whole Brain Zebrafish Foundation Model for Neuron Dynamics and Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27366)
*Sam Fatehmanesh Vegas,Matt Thomson,James Gornet,David Prober*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Sparse-Attention Whole-Brain Model (SBM) to predict neural activity and link it to behavior in larval zebrafish, emphasizing interpretability and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current whole-brain models struggle with scaling to single-neuron resolution, lack behavioral readouts, and fail to capture complex non-linear neuron interactions.

Method: The authors introduce SBM, a model utilizing sparse-attention mechanisms to analyze neuron activity across time and neurons. It predicts spike probabilities based on sensory stimuli and links them to behaviors using attention factorization and a behavior output head.

Result: The SBM demonstrated high prediction accuracy (<0.02 mean absolute error), stable rollouts, and effective neural pattern synthesis for behavior targeting on a separate test subject.

Conclusion: SBM offers a scalable approach for exploring complex neural and behavioral phenomena, providing accurate and interpretable insights at single-neuron resolution.

Abstract: Neural dynamics underlie behaviors from memory to sleep, yet identifying
mechanisms for higher-order phenomena (e.g., social interaction) is
experimentally challenging. Existing whole-brain models often fail to scale to
single-neuron resolution, omit behavioral readouts, or rely on PCA/conv
pipelines that miss long-range, non-linear interactions. We introduce a
sparse-attention whole-brain foundation model (SBM) for larval zebrafish that
forecasts neuron spike probabilities conditioned on sensory stimuli and links
brain state to behavior. SBM factorizes attention across neurons and along
time, enabling whole-brain scale and interpretability. On a held-out subject,
it achieves mean absolute error <0.02 with calibrated predictions and stable
autoregressive rollouts. Coupled to a permutation-invariant behavior head, SBM
enables gradient-based synthesis of neural patterns that elicit target
behaviors. This framework supports rapid, behavior-grounded exploration of
complex neural phenomena.

### [280] [Overspecified Mixture Discriminant Analysis: Exponential Convergence, Statistical Guarantees, and Remote Sensing Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27056)
*Arman Bolatov,Alan Legg,Igor Melnykov,Amantay Nurlanuly,Maxat Tezekbayev,Zhenisbek Assylbekov*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper studies the effects of overspecification in Mixture Discriminant Analysis using Gaussian mixture models, particularly analyzing classification error and algorithmic convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the theoretical implications of overspecified Mixture Discriminant Analysis is crucial as it's widely used empirically in complex data domains like image and text classification.

Method: This work uses a Gaussian mixture model for analytical modeling, assesses the convergence of the EM algorithm, and examines classification error rates for both population-level and finite samples.

Result: It was proven that the EM algorithm achieves exponential convergence to the Bayes risk at population level, and classification error converges to Bayes risk at a rate of $n^{−1/2}$ for finite samples.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretical framework for the performance of overspecified Mixture Discriminant Analysis and validates findings with experiments using remote sensing datasets.

Abstract: This study explores the classification error of Mixture Discriminant Analysis
(MDA) in scenarios where the number of mixture components exceeds those present
in the actual data distribution, a condition known as overspecification. We use
a two-component Gaussian mixture model within each class to fit data generated
from a single Gaussian, analyzing both the algorithmic convergence of the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and the statistical classification
error. We demonstrate that, with suitable initialization, the EM algorithm
converges exponentially fast to the Bayes risk at the population level.
Further, we extend our results to finite samples, showing that the
classification error converges to Bayes risk with a rate $n^{-1/2}$ under mild
conditions on the initial parameter estimates and sample size. This work
provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the performance of
overspecified MDA, which is often used empirically in complex data settings,
such as image and text classification. To validate our theory, we conduct
experiments on remote sensing datasets.

### [281] [Decreasing Entropic Regularization Averaged Gradient for Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27340)
*Ferdinand Genans,Antoine Godichon-Baggioni,François-Xavier Vialard,Olivier Wintenberger*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRAG, a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for semi-discrete Optimal Transport problems, demonstrating accelerated convergence by adaptively decreasing entropic regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias introduced by fixed entropic regularization in Optimal Transport problems while retaining computational efficiency.

Method: Developed DRAG algorithm, which decreases regularization over optimization steps, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Result: Showed that DRAG improves convergence rates compared to fixed regularization, achieving unbiased $c(1/t)$ rates for OT cost/potential and $c(1/sqrt(t)$ for OT map.

Conclusion: Adaptive regularization decrease leads to accelerated convergence and practical efficiency in solving semi-discrete OT problems.

Abstract: Adding entropic regularization to Optimal Transport (OT) problems has become
a standard approach for designing efficient and scalable solvers. However,
regularization introduces a bias from the true solution. To mitigate this bias
while still benefiting from the acceleration provided by regularization, a
natural solver would adaptively decrease the regularization as it approaches
the solution. Although some algorithms heuristically implement this idea, their
theoretical guarantees and the extent of their acceleration compared to using a
fixed regularization remain largely open. In the setting of semi-discrete OT,
where the source measure is continuous and the target is discrete, we prove
that decreasing the regularization can indeed accelerate convergence. To this
end, we introduce DRAG: Decreasing (entropic) Regularization Averaged Gradient,
a stochastic gradient descent algorithm where the regularization decreases with
the number of optimization steps. We provide a theoretical analysis showing
that DRAG benefits from decreasing regularization compared to a fixed scheme,
achieving an unbiased $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ sample and iteration complexity for
both the OT cost and the potential estimation, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$
rate for the OT map. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical
experiments that validate the effectiveness of DRAG and highlight its practical
advantages.

### [282] [On the Equivalence of Optimal Transport Problem and Action Matching with Optimal Vector Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27385)
*Nikita Kornilov,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores improvements to Flow Matching (FM) methods in generative modeling and introduces a new approach, Action Matching (AM), for optimizing probability distribution mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of mapping probability distributions by leveraging Optimal Transport (OT) methodologies, addressing limitations in FM approaches.

Method: The study modifies FM to consider optimal vector fields specific to OT problems and introduces AM for learning vector fields across sequences of distributions.

Result: Considering optimal vector fields enables better mappings in FM and introduces AM as a novel approach for solving OT problems with sequence-based distribution mappings.

Conclusion: Deploying optimal vector fields in FM and introducing AM provides more efficient solutions for generative modeling through Optimal Transport principles.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) method in generative modeling maps arbitrary probability
distributions by constructing an interpolation between them and then learning
the vector field that defines ODE for this interpolation. Recently, it was
shown that FM can be modified to map distributions optimally in terms of the
quadratic cost function for any initial interpolation. To achieve this, only
specific optimal vector fields, which are typical for solutions of Optimal
Transport (OT) problems, need to be considered during FM loss minimization. In
this note, we show that considering only optimal vector fields can lead to OT
in another approach: Action Matching (AM). Unlike FM, which learns a vector
field for a manually chosen interpolation between given distributions, AM
learns the vector field that defines ODE for an entire given sequence of
distributions.

### [283] [Interpretable Model-Aware Counterfactual Explanations for Random Forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27397)
*Joshua S. Harvey,Guanchao Feng,Sai Anusha Meesala,Tina Zhao,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using random forest models to generate counterfactual explanations in machine learning applications, offering a sparse and actionable alternative to Shapley values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many industries, like finance, require interpretable machine learning models that can explain decisions, but existing methods such as Shapley values do not align well with causal explanations seeking actionable insights.

Method: The authors propose using similarity learning with random forest representations to identify counterfactual explanations. They compute feature importance based on traversals of random forest partitions to reach the counterfactual instance.

Result: The approach was tested on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digits and the German credit dataset, showing that this method produced sparser and more actionable explanations compared to Shapley values.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more intuitive and meaningful way to generate counterfactual explanations, making machine learning models more interpretable and suitable for regulated domains requiring clear causal insights.

Abstract: Despite their enormous predictive power, machine learning models are often
unsuitable for applications in regulated industries such as finance, due to
their limited capacity to provide explanations. While model-agnostic frameworks
such as Shapley values have proved to be convenient and popular, they rarely
align with the kinds of causal explanations that are typically sought after.
Counterfactual case-based explanations, where an individual is informed of
which circumstances would need to be different to cause a change in outcome,
may be more intuitive and actionable. However, finding appropriate
counterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features
are most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of
counterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning,
exploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model
itself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the
explanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are
crossed in order to reach it from the original instance. We demonstrate this
method on both the MNIST hand-drawn digit dataset and the German credit
dataset, finding that it generates explanations that are sparser and more
useful than Shapley values.

*Binh Thuan Tran,Nicolas Schreuder*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a permutation-based sliced Wasserstein test for nonparametric two-sample testing and establishes its statistical guarantees with competitive power and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in theoretical foundations for hypothesis testing using the sliced Wasserstein distance, focusing on balancing statistical guarantees and computational efficiency.

Method: A permutation-based sliced Wasserstein test is developed and analyzed, inheriting Type I error control, achieving minimax separation rate $n^{-1/2}$, and quantifying projection power trade-offs.

Result: The test achieves finite-sample validity, minimax separation rates, competitive power, scalability, and eliminates the need for kernel tuning unlike kernel-based tests.

Conclusion: This test offers a robust and efficient alternative to kernel-based methods, combining strong theoretical guarantees and consistent empirical performance across various scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of nonparametric two-sample testing using the sliced
Wasserstein (SW) distance. While prior theoretical and empirical work indicates
that the SW distance offers a promising balance between strong statistical
guarantees and computational efficiency, its theoretical foundations for
hypothesis testing remain limited. We address this gap by proposing a
permutation-based SW test and analyzing its performance. The test inherits
finite-sample Type I error control from the permutation principle. Moreover, we
establish non-asymptotic power bounds and show that the procedure achieves the
minimax separation rate $n^{-1/2}$ over multinomial and bounded-support
alternatives, matching the optimal guarantees of kernel-based tests while
building on the geometric foundations of Wasserstein distances. Our analysis
further quantifies the trade-off between the number of projections and
statistical power. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the test
combines finite-sample validity with competitive power and scalability, and --
unlike kernel-based tests, which require careful kernel tuning -- it performs
consistently well across all scenarios we consider.

### [285] [Optimal Convergence Analysis of DDPM for General Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27562)
*Yuchen Jiao,Yuchen Zhou,Gen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper refines the convergence analysis of DDPM samplers, offering near-optimal rates and uncovering insights into their theoretical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek a tighter theoretical understanding of the convergence properties of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which is crucial despite its empirical success.

Method: The paper introduces a relaxed smoothness condition with the parameter L and analyzes DDPM's convergence rate in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence. It also establishes a lower bound to ensure tightness of the analysis.

Result: The analysis shows that DDPM achieves a convergence rate of \( \widetilde{O}\left( \frac{d\min\{d,L^2\}}{T^2} \right) \), improving on existing results under practical distributional scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a tight convergence rate, improves the theoretical understanding of DDPM, and raises an intriguing question about the faster empirical performance of DDIM.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical success in
generating high-quality samples from target data distributions. Among them, the
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) is one of the most widely used
samplers, generating samples via estimated score functions. Despite its
empirical success, a tight theoretical understanding of DDPM -- especially its
convergence properties -- remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a refined convergence analysis of the DDPM sampler
and establish near-optimal convergence rates under general distributional
assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a relaxed smoothness condition
parameterized by a constant $L$, which is small for many practical
distributions (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). We prove that the DDPM sampler
with accurate score estimates achieves a convergence rate of
$$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\min\{d,L^2\}}{T^2}\right)~\text{in
Kullback-Leibler divergence},$$ where $d$ is the data dimension, $T$ is the
number of iterations, and $\widetilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$.
This result substantially improves upon the best-known $d^2/T^2$ rate when $L <
\sqrt{d}$. By establishing a matching lower bound, we show that our convergence
analysis is tight for a wide array of target distributions. Moreover, it
reveals that DDPM and DDIM share the same dependence on $d$, raising an
interesting question of why DDIM often appears empirically faster.

TL;DR: This paper presents Bayesian optimization algorithms designed for networks modeled as metric graphs using Gaussian processes tailored to the graph's geometry. The effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize expensive or black-box objective functions defined over networks modeled as metric graphs, using tailored Gaussian process models.

Method: Bayesian optimization algorithms are employed, with Gaussian processes defined by Whittle-Matérn priors using stochastic partial differential equations. Practical cases are analyzed, including finite element approximations.

Result: The proposed algorithms effectively optimize benchmark objective functions on synthetic and telecommunication networks, as confirmed by numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the successful application of tailored Bayesian optimization algorithms for metric graphs, highlighting their potential in practical scenarios.

Abstract: This paper studies optimization on networks modeled as metric graphs.
Motivated by applications where the objective function is expensive to evaluate
or only available as a black box, we develop Bayesian optimization algorithms
that sequentially update a Gaussian process surrogate model of the objective to
guide the acquisition of query points. To ensure that the surrogates are
tailored to the network's geometry, we adopt Whittle-Mat\'ern Gaussian process
prior models defined via stochastic partial differential equations on metric
graphs. In addition to establishing regret bounds for optimizing sufficiently
smooth objective functions, we analyze the practical case in which the
smoothness of the objective is unknown and the Whittle-Mat\'ern prior is
represented using finite elements. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithms for optimizing benchmark objective functions on
a synthetic metric graph and for Bayesian inversion via maximum a posteriori
estimation on a telecommunication network.

*Dian Chen,Yunkai Chen,Tong Lin,Sijie Chen,Xiaolin Cheng*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: GeoPep is a framework for predicting peptide binding sites that overcomes challenges in protein-peptide interaction modeling using transfer learning and structural optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods struggled with protein-peptide interactions due to peptide flexibility and limited structural data, necessitating advanced approaches for prediction.

Method: GeoPep fine-tunes pre-trained representations from protein-protein binding using ESM3, integrates a neural network for pattern learning from sparse data, and employs distance-based loss functions leveraging 3D structural information.

Result: GeoPep surpasses current approaches in protein-peptide binding site prediction, demonstrating efficacy in capturing complex and sparse binding patterns.

Conclusion: GeoPep integrates multimodal techniques to address challenges in protein-peptide prediction, offering an enhanced and effective solution for identifying binding sites.

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate protein structure and sequence have
achieved remarkable success in protein-protein interface prediction. However,
extending these methods to protein-peptide interactions remains challenging due
to the inherent conformational flexibility of peptides and the limited
availability of structural data that hinder direct training of structure-aware
models. To address these limitations, we introduce GeoPep, a novel framework
for peptide binding site prediction that leverages transfer learning from ESM3,
a multimodal protein foundation model. GeoPep fine-tunes ESM3's rich
pre-learned representations from protein-protein binding to address the limited
availability of protein-peptide binding data. The fine-tuned model is further
integrated with a parameter-efficient neural network architecture capable of
learning complex patterns from sparse data. Furthermore, the model is trained
using distance-based loss functions that exploit 3D structural information to
enhance binding site prediction. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that
GeoPep significantly outperforms existing methods in protein-peptide binding
site prediction by effectively capturing sparse and heterogeneous binding
patterns.

*Nelson Mattié,Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa,Pablo Crespo-Peremarch,Juan-Ygnacio López-Hernández*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This paper focuses on mapping aboveground biomass in tropical dry forests using laser scanning technologies and machine learning approaches to contribute to improved forest conservation efforts under the Paris Climate Agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the need for accurate methods to estimate carbon pools in tropical dry forests, which are among the least understood and critical for climate change mitigation.

Method: The researchers utilized Airborne, Unmanned, and Space Laser Scanning systems along with machine learning applications like SVM regression to estimate aboveground biomass. They performed variable selection, regression tuning, and cross-validation to minimize overfitting and underfitting.

Result: Key variables related to tree height and canopy attributes were identified as important for biomass estimation. AGB values from sampled forest plots ranged from 26.02 Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha. SVM regression models demonstrated varied error rates, with the lowest error achieved using Space Laser Scanning Full-Waveform data.

Conclusion: The enhanced methodology demonstrates reliable AGB estimations for tropical dry forests, supporting forest conservation efforts and compliance with Paris Agreement requirements.

Abstract: According to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, all nations are required to
submit reports on their greenhouse gas emissions and absorption every two years
by 2024. Consequently, forests play a crucial role in reducing carbon
emissions, which is essential for meeting these obligations. Recognizing the
significance of forest conservation in the global battle against climate
change, Article 5 of the Paris Agreement emphasizes the need for high-quality
forest data. This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground
biomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the
least understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for
accurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis
of AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning
datasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches
SVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning
were used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable
selection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning
approach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results
indicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,
Elev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are
important for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,
canopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy
emerged as the most vital variables. AGB values estimated from ten permanent
tropical dry forest plots in Costa Rica Guanacaste province ranged from 26.02
Mg/ha to 175.43 Mg/ha . The SVM regressions demonstrated a 17.89 error across
all laser scanning systems, with SLSF W exhibiting the lowest error 17.07 in
estimating total biomass per plot.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a particle-based nonlinear state estimation method (pDANSE) using RNNs, addressing model-free processes with noisy nonlinear measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state estimation methods struggle with nonlinear measurement systems and unknown state transition models.

Method: pDANSE employs RNNs for Gaussian prior estimation, combined with a particle sampling approach and semi-supervised learning strategies.

Result: State estimation performance is validated experimentally using a stochastic Lorenz-63 system across different nonlinear measurement systems.

Conclusion: pDANSE is computationally efficient, competitive against particle filters with complete process knowledge, and bridges supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios effectively.

Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a data-driven nonlinear state estimation
(DANSE) method that uses (noisy) nonlinear measurements of a process whose
underlying state transition model (STM) is unknown. Such a process is referred
to as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides
parameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free
process, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of
DANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for
the state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system
renders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics
of the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed
at the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a
reparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the
second-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred
to as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential
measurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive
sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the
semi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised
learning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system
as a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation
performance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic
nonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is
used; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and
Cartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The
performance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\`a-vis particle
filters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in dynamical system simulations, as traditional solvers struggle in balancing these aspects and neural network models lack generalization.

Method: FMint-SDE uses a decoder-only transformer trained with in-context learning on coarse solutions generated by conventional solvers. It integrates numerical and textual modalities for error correction across varied systems.

Result: FMint-SDE demonstrates broad generalization and achieves superior accuracy-efficiency performance across diverse benchmarks in applications like molecular dynamics and finance.

Conclusion: FMint-SDE has significant potential as a general-purpose simulation tool, offering advantages over classical numerical methods in simulating dynamical systems.

Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge
across scientific and engineering domains. Traditional numerical integrators
often face a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, while
existing neural network-based approaches typically require training a separate
model for each case. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel
multi-modal foundation model for large-scale simulations of differential
equations: FMint-SDE (Foundation Model based on Initialization for stochastic
differential equations). Based on a decoder-only transformer with in-context
learning, FMint-SDE leverages numerical and textual modalities to learn a
universal error-correction scheme. It is trained using prompted sequences of
coarse solutions generated by conventional solvers, enabling broad
generalization across diverse systems. We evaluate our models on a suite of
challenging SDE benchmarks spanning applications in molecular dynamics,
mechanical systems, finance, and biology. Experimental results show that our
approach achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to classical
solvers, underscoring the potential of FMint-SDE as a general-purpose

anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write
latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as
time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected
by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time
monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases
system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage,
minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally,
ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with
observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts
also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management.
Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive
maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By
leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale
experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine
learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution
for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.

### [292] [Robust fuzzy clustering for high-dimensional multivariate time series with outlier detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26982)
*Ziling Ma,Ángel López-Oriona,Hernando Ombao,Ying Sun*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RFCPCA, a fuzzy subspace-clustering method tailored to multivariate time series (MTS) with features like membership-informed subspaces, arbitrary sequence lengths handling, robustness, and automated hyperparameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fuzzy clustering methods have limitations when applied to multivariate time series data, such as dealing with temporal dependencies, unequal sequence lengths, high dimensionality, and noise contamination.

Method: The paper proposes RFCPCA, a robust fuzzy subspace-clustering method that accommodates multivariate time series challenges by learning informed subspaces, implementing robustness techniques, and automatically selecting hyperparameters.

Result: RFCPCA enhances clustering accuracy in multivariate time series data and provides better characterization of membership uncertainty and outlier structure, demonstrated in the EEG monitoring of driver drowsiness.

Conclusion: RFCPCA effectively addresses shortcomings in existing fuzzy clustering techniques for MTS, establishing improved accuracy and robustness for applications such as EEG-based alertness monitoring.

Abstract: Fuzzy clustering provides a natural framework for modeling partial
memberships, particularly important in multivariate time series (MTS) where
state boundaries are often ambiguous. For example, in EEG monitoring of driver
alertness, neural activity evolves along a continuum (from unconscious to fully
alert, with many intermediate levels of drowsiness) so crisp labels are
unrealistic and partial memberships are essential. However, most existing
algorithms are developed for static, low-dimensional data and struggle with
temporal dependence, unequal sequence lengths, high dimensionality, and
contamination by noise or artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce
RFCPCA, a robust fuzzy subspace-clustering method explicitly tailored to MTS
that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind to simultaneously:
(i) learn membership-informed subspaces, (ii) accommodate unequal lengths and
moderately high dimensions, (iii) achieve robustness through trimming,
exponential reweighting, and a dedicated noise cluster, and (iv) automatically
select all required hyperparameters. These components enable RFCPCA to capture
latent temporal structure, provide calibrated membership uncertainty, and flag
series-level outliers while remaining stable under contamination. On driver
drowsiness EEG, RFCPCA improves clustering accuracy over related methods and
yields a more reliable characterization of uncertainty and outlier structure in
MTS.

### [293] [Asynchronous Risk-Aware Multi-Agent Packet Routing for Ultra-Dense LEO Satellite Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27506)
*Ke He,Thang X. Vu,Le He,Lisheng Fan,Symeon Chatzinotas,Bjorn Ottersten*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in routing for ultra-dense LEO satellite networks by proposing PRIMAL, an event-driven, risk-aware multi-agent framework, demonstrating superior performance in latency optimization and load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-dense LEO constellations pose challenges due to massive scale, dynamic topologies, and delays, necessitating adaptive, decentralized routing approaches that account for asynchronous decision-making and risk-awareness.

Method: PRIMAL employs a primal-dual approach for risk-aware routing, allowing satellites to independently act on event-driven timelines and manage tail-end risk through full cost distribution learning of QoS objectives.

Result: Simulations with 1584 satellites demonstrate PRIMAL's ability to reduce queuing delay by over 70% and achieve nearly 12 ms end-to-end delay reduction compared to a risk-oblivious baseline.

Conclusion: PRIMAL effectively addresses routing conflicts, optimizing latency and load while emphasizing the importance of autonomous risk-aware decision-making for robust satellite communications.

Abstract: The rise of ultra-dense LEO constellations creates a complex and asynchronous
network environment, driven by their massive scale, dynamic topologies, and
significant delays. This unique complexity demands an adaptive packet routing
algorithm that is asynchronous, risk-aware, and capable of balancing diverse
and often conflicting QoS objectives in a decentralized manner. However,
existing methods fail to address this need, as they typically rely on
impractical synchronous decision-making and/or risk-oblivious approaches. To
tackle this gap, we introduce PRIMAL, an event-driven multi-agent routing
framework designed specifically to allow each satellite to act independently on
its own event-driven timeline, while managing the risk of worst-case
performance degradation via a principled primal-dual approach. This is achieved
by enabling agents to learn the full cost distribution of the targeted QoS
objectives and constrain tail-end risks. Extensive simulations on a LEO
constellation with 1584 satellites validate its superiority in effectively
optimizing latency and balancing load. Compared to a recent risk-oblivious
baseline, it reduces queuing delay by over 70%, and achieves a nearly 12 ms
end-to-end delay reduction in loaded scenarios. This is accomplished by
resolving the core conflict between naive shortest-path finding and congestion
avoidance, highlighting such autonomous risk-awareness as a key to robust
routing.

### [294] [Accelerating Radiative Transfer for Planetary Atmospheres by Orders of Magnitude with a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27050)
*Isaac Malsky,Tiffany Kataria,Natasha E. Batalha,Matthew Graham*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning-based technique to emulate radiative transfer calculations in planetary atmospheres, achieving high accuracy and significant speed improvements (100x).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiative transfer computations in planetary atmospheres are computationally expensive, leading to accuracy-speed trade-offs and forcing simplified models that reduce simulation precision.

Method: The authors used an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture to train on 1D atmospheric profiles of solar-composition hot Jupiters, creating an efficient radiative transfer emulator.

Result: The emulator achieved ~1% mean test set error compared to traditional methods and demonstrated a 100x speedup.

Conclusion: Machine learning emulation of radiative transfer has the potential to enhance both speed and accuracy in planetary atmospheric modeling, particularly for applications like General Circulation Models (GCMs).

Abstract: Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary
atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose
accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical
simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade
the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal
candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined
physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and
high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations.
We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer
neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of
solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric
two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the
traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer
with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate
routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.

### [295] [When AI Trading Agents Compete: Adverse Selection of Meta-Orders by Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27334)
*Ali Raza Jafree,Konark Jain,Nick Firoozye*

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: The paper studies how high-frequency traders use reinforcement learning in a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model to exploit medium-frequency traders through adverse selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and replicate how high-frequency traders opportunistically exploit medium-frequency traders in financial markets through advanced modeling and machine learning techniques.

Method: The study involves reinforcement learning techniques (Proximal Policy Optimisation and self-imitation learning) within a Hawkes LOB model and impulse control frameworks for developing high-frequency market makers.

Result: The RL market making agent successfully learns to capitalize on price drift caused by medium-frequency traders executing meta-orders, but this does not greatly amplify slippage costs for the medium-frequency traders.

Conclusion: High-frequency trading continues to impact medium-frequency traders with adverse selection strategies, though the level of slippages incurred remains constrained despite increased profits for high-frequency market makers.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are
adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use
reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in
order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast
to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes
model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the
market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market
maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the
high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement
learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate
the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium
frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with
training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent
learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent
empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly
subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As
high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the
slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over
time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making
RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.

*Stefan Hermann,Hans-Peter Lehmann,Giorgio Vinciguerra,Stefan Walzer*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces learned static functions that use machine learning to capture correlations between keys and values in static function data structures, achieving significant memory savings while supporting arbitrary queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design a memory-efficient data structure for associating keys with values, surpassing current limitations in traditional hash tables and compressed techniques.

Method: The authors develop learned static functions, leveraging machine learning to predict probability distributions for keys, enabling a prefix-code-based encoding of values.

Result: Experiments demonstrate substantial space savings, up to 10x on real-world data and 1000x on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Learned static functions outperform existing techniques in memory efficiency by breaking the zero-order entropy barrier while maintaining query support.

Abstract: We consider the task of constructing a data structure for associating a
static set of keys with values, while allowing arbitrary output values for
queries involving keys outside the set. Compared to hash tables, these
so-called static function data structures do not need to store the key set and
thus use significantly less memory. Several techniques are known, with
compressed static functions approaching the zero-order empirical entropy of the
value sequence. In this paper, we introduce learned static functions, which use
machine learning to capture correlations between keys and values. For each key,
a model predicts a probability distribution over the values, from which we
derive a key-specific prefix code to compactly encode the true value. The
resulting codeword is stored in a classic static function data structure. This
design allows learned static functions to break the zero-order entropy barrier
while still supporting point queries. Our experiments show substantial space
savings: up to one order of magnitude on real data, and up to three orders of
magnitude on synthetic data.

*Lohitvel Gopikannan,Shashi Ranjan Kumar,Abhinav Sinha*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified estimation-guidance framework for UAV teams intercepting a non-maneuvering target, using both sensor-equipped and sensorless vehicles and cooperative strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in previous methods that handle estimation or guidance separately, and to enable effective interception of non-maneuvering targets using heterogeneous UAV teams.

Method: Developed a cooperative framework combining estimation and guidance using a prescribed-time observer and true proportional navigation guidance (TPNG), integrated via directed communication among vehicles.

Result: Simulations confirm the framework's success in achieving target state estimation and coordinated interception under diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently handles heterogeneity in UAV sensors and achieves robust interception performance through cooperative estimation and guidance design.

Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated estimation-guidance framework
for simultaneous interception of a non-maneuvering target using a team of
unmanned autonomous vehicles, assuming only a subset of vehicles are equipped
with dedicated sensors to measure the target's states. Unlike earlier
approaches that focus solely on either estimation or guidance design, the
proposed framework unifies both within a cooperative architecture. To
circumvent the limitation posed by heterogeneity in target observability,
sensorless vehicles estimate the target's state by leveraging information
exchanged with neighboring agents over a directed communication topology
through a prescribed-time observer. The proposed approach employs true
proportional navigation guidance (TPNG), which uses an exact time-to-go
formulation and is applicable across a wide spectrum of target motions.
Furthermore, prescribed-time observer and controller are employed to achieve
convergence to true target's state and consensus in time-to-go within set
predefined times, respectively. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework under various engagement scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper discusses biases in multimodal retrieval systems, identifying prevalence and association biases, and explores mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and understand biases in multimodal retrieval systems that reflect linguistic and cultural disparities, affecting equitable usage.

Method: The study analyzes image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval systems, focusing on biases caused by linguistic prevalence and cultural association.

Result: Explicit alignment effectively reduces linguistic prevalence bias, but association bias proves harder to mitigate, illustrating the limitations of generalized solutions.

Conclusion: To achieve fairness in multimodal systems, targeted approaches are necessary, as association bias poses a more profound challenge than linguistic prevalence bias.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space,
agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however,
retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations
shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such
biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from
prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text
retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images
culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in
text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more
effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias
remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that
achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies
beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may
be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic
prevalence.

*Yu Lin,Zhen Jia,Philipp Christmann,Xu Zhang,Shengdong Du,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TraceDR introduces a novel drug recommendation system using a medical knowledge graph for traceable and insightful medication suggestions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drug recommendation systems lack transparency in their derivation process, making them less effective for critical healthcare decisions.

Method: TraceDR uses a multi-task learning framework with a medical knowledge graph to simultaneously predict drug recommendations and provide traceability. It also introduces a framework for constructing patient health records and a large-scale testbed, DrugRec.

Result: TraceDR ensures more diverse coverage of diseases and drugs, enhances traceability, and offers improved insights compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: TraceDR addresses the traceability gap in drug recommendation systems, providing significant improvements in decision support and setting a new benchmark with DrugRec.

Abstract: Drug recommendation (DR) systems aim to support healthcare professionals in
selecting appropriate medications based on patients' medical conditions.
State-of-the-art approaches utilize deep learning techniques for improving DR,
but fall short in providing any insights on the derivation process of
recommendations -- a critical limitation in such high-stake applications. We
propose TraceDR, a novel DR system operating over a medical knowledge graph
(MKG), which ensures access to large-scale and high-quality information.
TraceDR simultaneously predicts drug recommendations and related evidence
within a multi-task learning framework, enabling traceability of medication
recommendations. For covering a more diverse set of diseases and drugs than
existing works, we devise a framework for automatically constructing patient
health records and release DrugRec, a new large-scale testbed for DR.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces enhancements to decision-tree rating elicitation for music recommendations, using genres and item pairs to improve clustering and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the cold-start user issue in recommender systems where personalized recommendations are challenging due to a lack of historical user data.

Method: The paper proposes extending decision-tree-based rating elicitation by gathering preferences on attributes like genres and employing item pairs in queries at each node to better understand user preferences.

Result: Experimental findings confirm that these enhancements improve overall recommendation performance while reducing the number of queries needed.

Conclusion: Both proposed modifications to the decision tree approach make the elicitation process more effective and efficient, particularly solving the cold-start problem in music recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are intelligent filtering methods that suggest
items to users based on their inferred preferences, derived from their
interaction history on the platform. Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on
users past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is
new to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical
data available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To
address this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial
ratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early
understanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally
categorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision
tree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about
their preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is
gathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach
for rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i)
elicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres
to better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at
each node to more effectively learn user preferences. Experimental results
demonstrate that both proposed enhancements lead to improved performance,
particularly with a reduced number of queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature-attribution methods often fail to capture interactions among feature sets, limiting insights into higher-order structures affecting predictions.

Method: MoI builds model explanation graphs from individual attributions, employs community detection for finding joint feature modules, and analyzes bias, redundancy, and causality patterns.

Result: MoI reveals correlated feature groups in synthetic and real-world datasets, enhances debugging through module-level ablations, and identifies bias exposure at module levels.

Conclusion: MoI advances explainability in AI by identifying collaborative feature modules, offering new metrics, implementation, and protocols for benchmarking module discovery.

Abstract: Feature-attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) explain individual predictions
but often miss higher-order structure: sets of features that act in concert. We
propose Modules of Influence (MoI), a framework that (i) constructs a model
explanation graph from per-instance attributions, (ii) applies community
detection to find feature modules that jointly affect predictions, and (iii)
quantifies how these modules relate to bias, redundancy, and causality
patterns. Across synthetic and real datasets, MoI uncovers correlated feature
groups, improves model debugging via module-level ablations, and localizes bias
exposure to specific modules. We release stability and synergy metrics, a
reference implementation, and evaluation protocols to benchmark module
discovery in XAI.

TL;DR: The study compares Grokipedia, an AI-powered encyclopedia, and Wikipedia to analyze their differences in content and editorial practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about biases and limitations of Wikipedia led to the development of Grokipedia as an AI-generated, "truthful" alternative.

Method: A computational comparison of 382 paired articles from Grokipedia and Wikipedia, analyzed across metrics like lexical richness, readability, structure, references, and semantic similarity.

Result: Grokipedia aligns with Wikipedia semantically and stylistically but produces longer, less diverse texts with fewer references per word and varied depth in structure.

Conclusion: Grokipedia mirrors Wikipedia's scope but diverges in editorial norms, raising questions about transparency and governance in AI-generated knowledge.

Abstract: The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon
Musk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural
biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce "truthful" entries via the large
language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases
and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study
undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 382 matched article pairs
between Grokipedia and Wikipedia. Using metrics across lexical richness,
readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic
similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and
substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and
stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less
lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and more variable
structural depth. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content
currently mirrors Wikipedia's informational scope but diverges in editorial
norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The
implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the
governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.

TL;DR: This paper investigates aesthetic manipulation in cookie banners, focusing on GDPR compliance and saliency using computer vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the prevalence of aesthetic manipulation in cookie banners and its compliance with GDPR guidelines.

Method: A computer vision model is employed to identify saliency in cookie banners on 2,579 websites, compared across EU and US contexts.

Result: 38% of compliant banners had aesthetic manipulation, EU websites exhibited design changes and more manipulation in response to users' regions.

Conclusion: Aesthetic manipulation in cookie banners is underestimated, highlighting innovative responses to privacy regulations.

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study how often cookie banners that comply
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contain aesthetic
manipulation, a design tactic to draw users' attention to the button that
permits personal data sharing. As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate
how frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national
data protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites
and identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the
relevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation
on 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic
manipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to
measure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This
enables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button
placement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common
than previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user
and/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the
European Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent,
and websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU
and from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU
websites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU
websites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than
non-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.

*Amaury Lancelin,Alex Wikner,Laurent Dubus,Clément Le Priol,Dorian S. Abbot,Freddy Bouchet,Pedram Hassanzadeh,Jonathan Weare*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces "AI+RES," a novel algorithm combining AI-based weather emulators and rare event sampling (RES) to efficiently analyze extreme weather events at a lower computational cost while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust and cost-effective methods to assess extreme weather events, which cannot be adequately studied due to limitations in observational data and the computational expense of global climate models (GCMs). AI and RES offer potential solutions but have existing challenges when applied to rare extreme events.

Method: The paper develops the AI+RES algorithm by utilizing AI weather emulator ensemble forecasts as the guiding "score function" for rare event sampling in GCMs. This approach facilitates efficient resampling, reducing computational costs while retaining the accuracy of extreme event statistics.

Result: AI+RES successfully generates extreme weather statistics (e.g., mid-latitude heatwaves) at 30-300 times lower computational cost and demonstrates predictive skill for many days in advance.

Conclusion: AI+RES integrates AI, RES, and GCMs to provide a scalable tool for studying rare extreme events in climate science and other fields, addressing key limitations of traditional methods and advancing research and applications in this domain.

Abstract: Assessing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and
understanding how climate change affects them, is crucial for developing
effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, observational datasets
are too short and physics-based global climate models (GCMs) are too
computationally expensive to obtain robust statistics for the rarest, yet most
impactful, extreme events. AI-based emulators have shown promise for
predictions at weather and even climate timescales, but they struggle on
extreme events with few or no examples in their training dataset. Rare event
sampling (RES) algorithms have previously demonstrated success for some extreme
events, but their performance depends critically on a hard-to-identify "score
function", which guides efficient sampling by a GCM. Here, we develop a novel
algorithm, AI+RES, which uses ensemble forecasts of an AI weather emulator as
the score function to guide highly efficient resampling of the GCM and generate
robust (physics-based) extreme weather statistics and associated dynamics at
30-300x lower cost. We demonstrate AI+RES on mid-latitude heatwaves, a
challenging test case requiring a score function with predictive skill many
days in advance. AI+RES, which synergistically integrates AI, RES, and GCMs,
offers a powerful, scalable tool for studying extreme events in climate
science, as well as other disciplines in science and engineering where rare
events and AI emulators are active areas of research.

TL;DR: The paper addresses heterogeneity in query workloads for LLM serving systems, proposing category-aware semantic caching and a hybrid architecture to optimize performance, reduce costs for remote searches, and dynamically adapt to load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiencies in handling heterogeneous query workloads in LLM serving systems, particularly issues caused by varying query characteristics, staleness, and caching inefficiencies.

Method: The authors introduced category-aware semantic caching which utilizes variable thresholds, TTLs, and quotas based on query categories and implemented a hybrid architecture that separates in-memory search from external storage to optimize performance.

Result: The proposed system improved economic feasibility for low-hit-rate categories, expanded cache coverage, and enabled dynamic adjustments to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% through adaptive policies.

Conclusion: The approach of category-aware caching and hybrid architectures effectively tackles inefficiencies in LLM serving systems, enhancing workload handling, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability.

Abstract: LLM serving systems process heterogeneous query workloads where different
categories exhibit different characteristics. Code queries cluster densely in
embedding space while conversational queries distribute sparsely. Content
staleness varies from minutes (stock data) to months (code patterns). Query
repetition patterns range from power-law (code) to uniform (conversation),
producing long tail cache hit rate distributions: high-repetition categories
achieve 40-60% hit rates while low-repetition or volatile categories achieve
5-15% hit rates. Vector databases must exclude the long tail because remote
search costs (30ms) require 15--20% hit rates to break even, leaving 20-30% of
production traffic uncached. Uniform cache policies compound this problem:
fixed thresholds cause false positives in dense spaces and miss valid
paraphrases in sparse spaces; fixed TTLs waste memory or serve stale data. This
paper presents category-aware semantic caching where similarity thresholds,
TTLs, and quotas vary by query category. We present a hybrid architecture
separating in-memory HNSW search from external document storage, reducing miss
cost from 30ms to 2ms. This reduction makes low-hit-rate categories
economically viable (break-even at 3-5% versus 15-20%), enabling cache coverage
across the entire workload distribution. Adaptive load-based policies extend
this framework to respond to downstream model load, dynamically adjusting
thresholds and TTLs to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% in
theoretical projections.

### [307] [SpotIt: Evaluating Text-to-SQL Evaluation with Formal Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26840)
*Rocky Klopfenstein,Yang He,Andrew Tremante,Yuepeng Wang,Nina Narodytska,Haoze Wu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper criticizes current test-based Text-to-SQL evaluation methods as being unreliable and proposes a new evaluation pipeline, SpotIt, which utilizes formal verification to identify differences in SQL queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current test-based Text-to-SQL evaluations, which may incorrectly assess SQL query equivalence due to output coincidences on static databases.

Method: Introduced SpotIt, a bounded equivalence verification engine, to actively differentiate generated SQL queries from ground-truth; extended the model to accommodate a richer subset of SQL relevant to Text-to-SQL scenarios.

Result: Performance evaluations on 10 Text-to-SQL models using the BIRD dataset showed that test-based methods often miss query differences. SpotIt offered more reliable insight into query discrepancies.

Conclusion: Existing test-based evaluations are insufficient for accurately assessing Text-to-SQL performance. SpotIt provides a robust alternative to drive more reliable and nuanced evaluations in the field.

Abstract: Community-driven Text-to-SQL evaluation platforms play a pivotal role in
tracking the state of the art of Text-to-SQL performance. The reliability of
the evaluation process is critical for driving progress in the field. Current
evaluation methods are largely test-based, which involves comparing the
execution results of a generated SQL query and a human-labeled ground-truth on
a static test database. Such an evaluation is optimistic, as two queries can
coincidentally produce the same output on the test database while actually
being different. In this work, we propose a new alternative evaluation
pipeline, called SpotIt, where a formal bounded equivalence verification engine
actively searches for a database that differentiates the generated and
ground-truth SQL queries. We develop techniques to extend existing verifiers to
support a richer SQL subset relevant to Text-to-SQL. A performance evaluation
of ten Text-to-SQL methods on the high-profile BIRD dataset suggests that
test-based methods can often overlook differences between the generated query
and the ground-truth. Further analysis of the verification results reveals a
more complex picture of the current Text-to-SQL evaluation.

### [308] [DRAMA: Unifying Data Retrieval and Analysis for Open-Domain Analytic Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27238)
*Chuxuan Hu,Maxwell Yang,James Weiland,Yeji Lim,Suhas Palawala,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces DRAMA, a paradigm answering analytic queries in natural language via an end-to-end unified pipeline for data collection, transformation, and analysis. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data analysis methods are labor-intensive, and existing automation systems lack effectiveness in three critical areas: open-domain data collection, structured transformation, and analytic reasoning.

Method: The authors develop DRAMA, an end-to-end modular system, and a benchmarking dataset (DRAMA-Bench) for evaluating tasks like claim verification and question answering. DRAMA-Bot implements this paradigm using a multi-agent system to retrieve, process, and analyze data efficiently.

Result: DRAMA-Bot achieves superior accuracy (86.5%) on benchmark tasks while being cost-efficient, exceeding baseline agents by up to 6.9 times in accuracy and achieving lower operation costs.

Conclusion: DRAMA addresses existing gaps in automated data analysis by offering an integrated pipeline that is both accurate and cost-effective. Its public availability enables further research and practical applications.

Abstract: Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and
inefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none
of the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key
capabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data
collection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that
answers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain
data. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single
pipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative
of DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories
of tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100
instances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have
gained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of
open-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following
DRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by
coordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs
structured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on
DRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot
achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines
with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is
publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/drama.

*Joyoni Dey,Hunter C. Meyer,Murtuza S. Taqi*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI) for detecting early-stage lung tumors using artificial neural networks, demonstrating significant accuracy improvement over standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lung cancer screening via low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is limited by infrastructure, accessibility, and accuracy due to high false positives and sensitivity issues.

Method: Realistic synthetic lung tumor datasets were created using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiographs, followed by training a U-Net segmentation network using these inputs.

Result: DFI achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, outperforming ATTN-only results (51 percent) while having similar specificity. Combined ATTN and DFI models achieved high specificity (97.6 percent) with 79.6 percent sensitivity.

Conclusion: DFI imaging significantly enhances early lung tumor detection and presents a promising alternative for effective, cost-efficient, low-dose screening, especially in regions lacking LDCT infrastructure.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer
screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack
LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer
detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening
Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of
26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI)
radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar
microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly
improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning
segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of
euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular
boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A
U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,
or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels. Results show that the DFI-only model
achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51
percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus
92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent
sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially
improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation
radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose
alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is
unavailable.

*Amine Razig,Youssef Soulaymani,Loubna Benabbou,Pierre Cauchy*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) framework for monitoring marine mammals in the St. Lawrence Estuary, which outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and robustness, even under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated monitoring of marine mammals in challenging environments like the St. Lawrence Estuary is difficult due to noise, overlapping calls, and varied frequency ranges. There is a need for robust and generalized solutions for biodiversity monitoring.

Method: The authors propose a multi-step, attention-guided Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) framework that uses segmentation to create soft energy masks of biologically relevant features and integrates these masks with raw inputs through mid-level fusion for multi-band classification.

Result: The framework demonstrated improved signal discrimination, fewer false positives, and reliable monitoring in real-world recordings. It maintained robust performance under distributional shifts and alternative acoustic transformations, outperforming high-capacity baseline models.

Conclusion: The MGC framework provides a robust, generalized method for operational marine mammal monitoring, addressing challenges like environmental noise and distributional shifts. Its ability to learn transferable representations makes it effective for large-scale monitoring applications.

Abstract: Automated monitoring of marine mammals in the St. Lawrence Estuary faces
extreme challenges: calls span low-frequency moans to ultrasonic clicks, often
overlap, and are embedded in variable anthropogenic and environmental noise. We
introduce a multi-step, attention-guided framework that first segments
spectrograms to generate soft masks of biologically relevant energy and then
fuses these masks with the raw inputs for multi-band, denoised classification.
Image and mask embeddings are integrated via mid-level fusion, enabling the
model to focus on salient spectrogram regions while preserving global context.
Using real-world recordings from the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park Research
Station in Canada, we demonstrate that segmentation-driven attention and
mid-level fusion improve signal discrimination, reduce false positive
detections, and produce reliable representations for operational marine mammal
monitoring across diverse environmental conditions and signal-to-noise ratios.
Beyond in-distribution evaluation, we further assess the generalization of
Mask-Guided Classification (MGC) under distributional shifts by testing on
spectrograms generated with alternative acoustic transformations. While
high-capacity baseline models lose accuracy in this Out-of-distribution (OOD)
setting, MGC maintains stable performance, with even simple fusion mechanisms
(gated, concat) achieving comparable results across distributions. This
robustness highlights the capacity of MGC to learn transferable representations
rather than overfitting to a specific transformation, thereby reinforcing its
suitability for large-scale, real-world biodiversity monitoring. We show that
in all experimental settings, the MGC framework consistently outperforms
baseline architectures, yielding substantial gains in accuracy on both
in-distribution and OOD data.

*Jinting Wang,Jun Wang,Hei Victor Cheng,Li Liu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new approach to generate high-quality, high-resolution talking face videos directly from speech, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods depend on source images as references, which limit their ability to fully utilize speech dynamics for talking face generation.

Method: The proposed approach includes a speech-to-face portrait generation using a speech-conditioned diffusion model and further speech-driven talking face generation with enhanced lip synchronization and high-resolution video rendering.

Result: Experimental validation on datasets like HDTF, VoxCeleb, and AVSpeech confirms superior performance of this method over existing ones.

Conclusion: This method successfully advances speech-to-talking face generation, achieving high-quality results solely from speech, and marks a significant milestone in the field.

Abstract: Unlike existing methods that rely on source images as appearance references
and use source speech to generate motion, this work proposes a novel approach
that directly extracts information from the speech, addressing key challenges
in speech-to-talking face. Specifically, we first employ a speech-to-face
portrait generation stage, utilizing a speech-conditioned diffusion model
combined with statistical facial prior and a sample-adaptive weighting module
to achieve high-quality portrait generation. In the subsequent speech-driven
talking face generation stage, we embed expressive dynamics such as lip
movement, facial expressions, and eye movements into the latent space of the
diffusion model and further optimize lip synchronization using a
region-enhancement module. To generate high-resolution outputs, we integrate a
pre-trained Transformer-based discrete codebook with an image rendering
network, enhancing video frame details in an end-to-end manner. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on the
HDTF, VoxCeleb, and AVSpeech datasets. Notably, this is the first method
capable of generating high-resolution, high-quality talking face videos
exclusively from a single speech input.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a methodology for unsupervised model evaluation in Bayesian imaging science settings where the ground truth is unavailable, using Bayesian cross-validation and randomized data splitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for unsupervised model evaluation in imaging science are computationally expensive and incompatible with machine learning-based image priors.

Method: The proposed method combines Bayesian cross-validation and data fission techniques, ensuring compatibility with modern Bayesian imaging samplers, such as diffusion and plug-and-play samplers.

Result: The technique successfully achieves accurate model selection and misspecification detection across experiments at reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: This innovative methodology provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for evaluating Bayesian models in imaging sciences without relying on ground truth data.

Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to
address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper
addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground
truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification
diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable
for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and
incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine
learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model
selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on
a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized
measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian
imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate
the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types
of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection
accuracy with a low computational cost.

TL;DR: The study used optimized R3GAN strategies to generate realistic images for small and imbalanced medical datasets, enhancing classification performance in embryo imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis is often limited by data scarcity and class imbalance, restricting deep learning applications in clinical settings.

Method: Systematic experiments with R3GAN were done, optimizing its training strategies with a specific burn-in phase and gamma adjustments for datasets of 256x256 resolution.

Result: Generated images balanced an imbalanced embryo dataset, resulting in significant improvements in classification performance, such as increased recall and F1-score for certain classes.

Conclusion: Tailored R3GAN training can effectively mitigate data scarcity and improve model robustness in small medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Medical image analysis often suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance,
limiting the effectiveness of deep learning models in clinical applications.
Using human embryo time-lapse imaging (TLI) as a case study, this work
investigates how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be optimized for
small datasets to generate realistic and diagnostically meaningful images.
Based on systematic experiments with R3GAN, we established effective training
strategies and designed an optimized configuration for 256x256-resolution
datasets, featuring a full burn-in phase and a low, gradually increasing gamma
range (5 -> 40). The generated samples were used to balance an imbalanced
embryo dataset, leading to substantial improvement in classification
performance. The recall and F1-score of t3 increased from 0.06 to 0.69 and 0.11
to 0.60, respectively, without compromising other classes. These results
demonstrate that tailored R3GAN training strategies can effectively alleviate
data scarcity and improve model robustness in small-scale medical imaging
tasks.

TL;DR: This study compares three denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for generating 3D T1-weighted MRI brain images, with varying levels of statistical similarity to real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop and evaluate methods for generating high-resolution 3D MRI brain images while preserving visual variability and natural characteristics without heavy pre-processing.

Method: Three DDPMs were trained on a large dataset of brain MRI scans (80,675 volumes) to generate coherent 3D brain images. Images were minimally preprocessed, and models were assessed via segmentation, FID scores, and qualitative inspection.

Result: All DDPMs generated coherent brain images, with velocity and flow prediction models achieving better FID scores than sample prediction model but still higher than those of real images. Volume distributions differed statistically, though some models performed better in certain brain regions.

Conclusion: This study introduces novel 3D diffusion models capable of generating T1-weighted brain MRI images without pre-processing methods like skullstripping. Models/results are publicly shared despite statistical deviations from real data.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present and compare three denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) that generate 3D $T_1$-weighted MRI human brain
images. Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406
subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had
approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three
human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and
excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the
visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce
images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were
neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected.
Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and
qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent
MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs
than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs
compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment,
the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from
real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer
statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In
conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion
model for brain data without skullstripping or registration. Despite the
negative results in statistical testing, the presented DDPMs are capable of
generating high-resolution 3D $T_1$-weighted brain images. All model weights

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fragile zero-watermarking method using dual quaternion matrix decomposition for copyright protection and tamper detection of medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images are at risk during transmission and sharing due to copyright issues and content tampering, emphasizing the need for effective protection.

Method: Utilization of dual quaternion matrix decomposition to construct watermarks without altering the original image, based on the relationship between standard and dual parts of quaternions.

Result: Achieves a secure and effective copyright protection model along with tampering detection capabilities for medical images.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides an innovative solution to safeguard medical images against copyright violations and tampering without modifying the original content.

Abstract: Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote
consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and
sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content
tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an
effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology
focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by
extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting
medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model
based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational
relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to
correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates
zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion
matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content
tampering detection for medical images.

*Meghraj Prajapat,Alankar Alankar*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: EBSD methods face challenges at high scanning speeds due to noisy patterns, reducing indexing accuracy. This study proposes generative machine learning models to restore these noisy EBSD patterns, enabling accurate crystallographic orientation determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EBSD methods struggle to produce accurate results when high scanning speeds reduce exposure times, leading to lower signal-to-noise ratios and noisy diffraction patterns.

Method: The research develops generative machine learning models for post-processing or on-the-fly restoration of noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds.

Result: The generative models effectively enhance the quality of EBSD patterns captured at short exposure times, showing reliable performance despite not requiring large datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that generative machine learning models are efficient solutions to restore noisy EBSD patterns, providing accurate indexing in challenging high-speed scanning scenarios.

Abstract: Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon
methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret
diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these
methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high
scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the
operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases
for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced
indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine
learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi
patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high
scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of
crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the
performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns
captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation
is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces VISAT, a dataset and benchmarking suite focusing on model robustness for traffic sign recognition, addressing adversarial attacks and distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and improve model robustness for traffic sign recognition in scenarios involving adversarial attacks and distribution shifts.

Method: The authors created two benchmarks for adversarial attacks (using PGD method) and distribution shifts, leveraging multi-task learning (MTL) networks with attribute-specific data, synthetic alterations, and corrupted datasets.

Result: Experiments conducted using ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32 demonstrated the challenges posed by adversarial attacks, spurious correlations among MTL tasks, and robustness differences between base and MTL models.

Conclusion: This work enhances the understanding of traffic sign recognition under challenging conditions, aiming to advance robust model development for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating
model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of
visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our
dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness
against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack
benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular
models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on
attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious
correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes
(color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in
our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's
realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform
evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further
explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of
traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus
on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance
between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework
contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign
recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and
distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in
developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving
and cyber-physical systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Introducing CPT-Filtering, a technique exploiting Byte-Pair Encoding tokenizers to identify encoded malicious prompts targeting LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks where encoded text bypasses safety guardrails, requiring a cost-effective and accurate filtering method.

Method: The approach relies on Byte-Pair Encoding tokenizers to detect encoded malicious text by observing the average number of Characters Per Token (CPT), exploiting tokenizers' handling of out-of-distribution text.

Result: Experiments on over 100,000 prompts with various encoding schemes confirmed the method's robustness and high accuracy even for short inputs.

Conclusion: CPT-Filtering offers a model-agnostic, accurate and low-cost solution for defense against encoded jailbreak attacks, suitable for real-time and offline text filtering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where
malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to
bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the
encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful
instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with
negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to
mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that
tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,
such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our
technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the
average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is
motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules
such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a
large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with
several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT
threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very
short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be
immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.

Motivation: The growing IoT systems have increased security vulnerabilities, and current AI-driven attack analysis lacks consistent quantitative benchmarks to assess effectiveness.

Method: The authors integrated ML for multi-class attack detection and LLMs for analyzing attack behavior and suggesting mitigation strategies. They benchmarked on two datasets and used structured prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and multiple LLM judge models for evaluation.

Result: Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy among detection models. ChatGPT-o3 provided superior attack analysis and mitigation responses compared to DeepSeek-R1.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework demonstrates effectiveness in securing IoT systems, with improved attack detection and actionable mitigation suggestions. The proposed metrics enable objective evaluation of AI-driven security models.

Abstract: The Internet of Things has expanded rapidly, transforming communication and
operations across industries but also increasing the attack surface and
security breaches. Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in securing IoT,
enabling attack detection, attack behavior analysis, and mitigation suggestion.
Despite advancements, evaluations remain purely qualitative, and the lack of a
standardized, objective benchmark for quantitatively measuring AI-based attack
analysis and mitigation hinders consistent assessment of model effectiveness.
In this work, we propose a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) for
multi-class attack detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack

### [320] [Adapting Large Language Models to Emerging Cybersecurity using Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27080)
*Arnabh Borah,Md Tanvirul Alam,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to improve large language models (LLMs) for cybersecurity by addressing the need for accurate and adaptive threat detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current use of LLMs in cybersecurity is limited by their opaque reasoning and inability to adapt rapidly to new threats. There is a pressing need for efficient methods to enhance LLM adaptability and reliability.

Method: The authors introduce a RAG-based framework utilizing external datasets and the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model. They compare baseline RAG and an optimized hybrid retrieval approach through performance analysis across multiple metrics.

Result: The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of hybrid retrieval in enhancing the adaptability and reliability of LLMs for cybersecurity.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval can significantly improve the efficiency and trustworthiness of LLMs in cybersecurity applications, especially by addressing dynamic threat landscapes.

Abstract: Security applications are increasingly relying on large language models
(LLMs) for cyber threat detection; however, their opaque reasoning often limits
trust, particularly in decisions that require domain-specific cybersecurity
knowledge. Because security threats evolve rapidly, LLMs must not only recall
historical incidents but also adapt to emerging vulnerabilities and attack
patterns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness
in general LLM applications, but its potential for cybersecurity remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce a RAG-based framework designed to
contextualize cybersecurity data and enhance LLM accuracy in knowledge
retention and temporal reasoning. Using external datasets and the
Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, we evaluate baseline RAG, an optimized hybrid
retrieval approach, and conduct a comparative analysis across multiple
performance metrics. Our findings highlight the promise of hybrid retrieval in
strengthening the adaptability and reliability of LLMs for cybersecurity tasks.

### [321] [Unvalidated Trust: Cross-Stage Vulnerabilities in Large Language Model Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27190)
*Dominik Schwarz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper identifies 41 recurring risk patterns in commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on vulnerabilities arising from unvalidated trust between processing stages. It proposes zero-trust architectural principles and introduces "Countermind," a conceptual framework for defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the practical concerns of vulnerabilities and risk patterns in automated pipelines using LLMs, caused by unvalidated trust between processing stages.

Method: The authors conducted a taxonomy-based analysis of risk patterns and identified architectural failure modes. They recommended solutions like provenance enforcement, context sealing, and plan revalidation.

Result: The study revealed that LLM inputs often lead to unintended state changes and that many vulnerabilities arise due to insufficient string-level filtering.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that zero-trust principles can mitigate cross-stage risks in LLM pipelines, and the "Countermind" framework acts as a blueprint for implementing these defenses effectively.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated,
multi-stage pipelines, risk patterns that arise from unvalidated trust between
processing stages become a practical concern. This paper presents a
mechanism-centered taxonomy of 41 recurring risk patterns in commercial LLMs.
The analysis shows that inputs are often interpreted non-neutrally and can
trigger implementation-shaped responses or unintended state changes even
without explicit commands. We argue that these behaviors constitute
architectural failure modes and that string-level filtering alone is
insufficient. To mitigate such cross-stage vulnerabilities, we recommend
zero-trust architectural principles, including provenance enforcement, context
sealing, and plan revalidation, and we introduce "Countermind" as a conceptual
blueprint for implementing these defenses.

### [322] [Sybil-Resistant Service Discovery for Agent Economies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27554)
*David Shi,Kevin Joo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents TraceRank, a reputation-weighted ranking algorithm for cryptocurrency payment-based services, emphasizing trustworthiness and service quality over transaction volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of discovering trustworthy and reliable services in x402-enabled environments, where agents increasingly rely on HTTP services accepting cryptocurrency payments.

Method: Developed TraceRank, which uses reputation propagation through payment transactions (based on value and recency) to rank services. It combines reputation-based rankings with semantic search for responding to natural language queries.

Result: TraceRank surfaces high-quality services endorsed by reputable users, mitigating Sybil attacks and avoiding bias from transaction volume-focused or purely semantic-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ranking approach improves service discovery in x402 networks by prioritizing reputation and resisting spam, providing a robust alternative to traditional volume-based ranking systems.

Abstract: x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application
programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept
cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these
services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent
trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a
reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as
endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and
propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and
temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services
preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction
volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to
natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation
propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many
low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation
payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled
services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely
volume based or semantic methods.

*Boyi Wei,Zora Che,Nathaniel Li,Udari Madhushani Sehwag,Jasper Götting,Samira Nedungadi,Julian Michael,Summer Yue,Dan Hendrycks,Peter Henderson,Zifan Wang,Seth Donoughe,Mantas Mazeika*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses the dual-use dilemma in open-weight bio-foundation models, emphasizing their risks in bioweapons development despite their scientific potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of current filtering practices that aim to mitigate dual-use risks in bio-foundation models.

Method: The authors developed the \eval framework for analyzing bio-foundation models in sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction.

Result: Current filtering practices are insufficient since excluded knowledge can be recovered through fine-tuning or simple probing.

Conclusion: Data filtering alone cannot effectively address dual-use risks, highlighting the need for enhanced safety and security strategies for bio-foundation models.

Abstract: Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding
great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they
could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the
risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous
data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach
remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune
these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \eval, a
framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce
the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \eval assesses models'
virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling,
mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that
current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded
knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits
broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals
may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via
simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data
filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research
into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation
models.

### [324] [Residual Distribution Predictive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26914)
*Sam Allen,Enrico Pescara,Johanna Ziegel*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces Residual Distribution Predictive Systems, an approach to construct predictive systems with theoretical out-of-sample calibration guarantees, showing competitive performance with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive systems by addressing the stringent requirements of conformity measures and offering an alternative to traditional systems for calibration guarantees.

Method: Developing Residual Distribution Predictive Systems within split and full conformal settings, leveraging regression methods without rigid conformity measure constraints.

Result: The approach was empirically tested on simulated data, showing competitive performance with conformal predictive systems and offering flexibility for implementation with diverse regression methods.

Conclusion: Residual Distribution Predictive Systems provide a promising alternative to conformal predictive systems, balancing theoretical calibration guarantees and implementation flexibility.

Abstract: Conformal predictive systems are sets of predictive distributions with
theoretical out-of-sample calibration guarantees. The calibration guarantees
are typically that the set of predictions contains a forecast distribution
whose prediction intervals exhibit the correct marginal coverage at all levels.
Conformal predictive systems are constructed using conformity measures that
quantify how well possible outcomes conform with historical data. However,
alternative methods have been proposed to construct predictive systems with
more appealing theoretical properties. We study an approach to construct
predictive systems that we term Residual Distribution Predictive Systems. In
the split conformal setting, this approach nests conformal predictive systems
with a popular class of conformity measures, providing an alternative
perspective on the classical approach. In the full conformal setting, the two
approaches differ, and the new approach has the advantage that it does not rely
on a conformity measure satisfying fairly stringent requirements to ensure that
the predictive system is well-defined; it can readily be implemented alongside
any point-valued regression method to yield predictive systems with
out-of-sample calibration guarantees. The empirical performance of this
approach is assessed using simulated data, where it is found to perform
competitively with conformal predictive systems. However, the new approach
offers considerable scope for implementation with alternative regression
methods.

TL;DR: This paper describes a protocol to study the impacts of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through comparative quantitative designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dispersed evidence regarding the effectiveness of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) on clinical and healthcare delivery outcomes, specifically in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Method: The researchers will include studies with comparative quantitative designs like randomized trials and controlled before-after studies. They plan to systematically review databases and grey sources up to September 2024, with risk assessments using tools like RoB 2 and ROBINS-I. Both meta-analysis and structured narrative synthesis will be used for data evaluation.

Result: The study aims to identify and quantify the effects of CDSS on patient and healthcare delivery outcomes, focusing on LMICs. It will utilize statistical and narratively structured summaries.

Conclusion: This research will provide evidence on the influence of CDSS in LMICs, offering insights for improved decision-making in clinical and healthcare settings.

Abstract: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are used to improve clinical and
service outcomes, yet evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is
dispersed. This protocol outlines methods to quantify the impact of CDSS on
patient and healthcare delivery outcomes in LMICs. We will include comparative
quantitative designs (randomized trials, controlled before-after, interrupted
time series, comparative cohorts) evaluating CDSS in World Bank-defined LMICs.
Standalone qualitative studies are excluded; mixed-methods studies are eligible
only if they report comparative quantitative outcomes, for which we will
extract the quantitative component. Searches (from inception to 30 September
2024) will cover MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Global
Health, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, LILACS, African Index Medicus, and IndMED, plus
grey sources. Screening and extraction will be performed in duplicate. Risk of
bias will be assessed with RoB 2 (randomized trials) and ROBINS-I
(non-randomized). Random-effects meta-analysis will be performed where outcomes
are conceptually or statistically comparable; otherwise, a structured narrative
synthesis will be presented. Heterogeneity will be explored using relative and
absolute metrics and a priori subgroups or meta-regression (condition area,
care level, CDSS type, readiness proxies, study design).

### [326] [LLMs are Overconfident: Evaluating Confidence Interval Calibration with FermiEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26995)
*Elliot L. Epstein,John Winnicki,Thanawat Sornwanee,Rajat Dwaraknath*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper highlights how large language models are systematically overconfident when constructing confidence intervals around their answers. A benchmark and methods such as conformal prediction and quantile adjustment are introduced to mitigate this, and a theory explains their overconfidence behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the systematic overconfidence of large language models (LLMs) in estimating uncertainties and constructing confidence intervals.

Method: The authors develop FermiEval, a benchmark for evaluating confidence interval scoring. They use conformal prediction methods to adjust intervals and propose additional techniques like direct probability elicitation and quantile adjustment.

Result: Their adjustments improve coverage accuracy to 99%, reduce interval overconfidence, and achieve a 54% reduction in Winkler interval score.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit overconfidence due to a truncated sampling behavior in their perceived distributions. The proposed methods address this issue effectively and improve their estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at numerical estimation but struggle to
correctly quantify uncertainty. We study how well LLMs construct confidence
intervals around their own answers and find that they are systematically
overconfident. To evaluate this behavior, we introduce FermiEval, a benchmark
of Fermi-style estimation questions with a rigorous scoring rule for confidence
interval coverage and sharpness. Across several modern models, nominal 99\%
intervals cover the true answer only 65\% of the time on average. With a
conformal prediction based approach that adjusts the intervals, we obtain
accurate 99\% observed coverage, and the Winkler interval score decreases by
54\%. We also propose direct log-probability elicitation and quantile
adjustment methods, which further reduce overconfidence at high confidence
levels. Finally, we develop a perception-tunnel theory explaining why LLMs
exhibit overconfidence: when reasoning under uncertainty, they act as if
sampling from a truncated region of their inferred distribution, neglecting its
tails.

*Jinting Wang,Chenxing Li,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces GACA-DiT, a framework for generating rhythmically consistent and temporally aligned music from dance movements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve issues in existing methods like coarse rhythm embeddings and temporal mismatches, which weaken the alignment between dance movements and music.

Method: Introduces GACA-DiT framework with genre-adaptive rhythm extraction and context-aware temporal alignment modules.

Result: Experiments on AIST++ and TikTok datasets show GACA-DiT achieves superior performance compared to existing models in both objective metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: GACA-DiT effectively addresses rhythmic and temporal alignment challenges in dance-to-music generation and sets a new benchmark in this domain.

Abstract: Dance-to-music (D2M) generation aims to automatically compose music that is
rhythmically and temporally aligned with dance movements. Existing methods
typically rely on coarse rhythm embeddings, such as global motion features or
binarized joint-based rhythm values, which discard fine-grained motion cues and
result in weak rhythmic alignment. Moreover, temporal mismatches introduced by
feature downsampling further hinder precise synchronization between dance and
music. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{GACA-DiT}, a diffusion
transformer-based framework with two novel modules for rhythmically consistent
and temporally aligned music generation. First, a \textbf{genre-adaptive rhythm
extraction} module combines multi-scale temporal wavelet analysis and spatial
phase histograms with adaptive joint weighting to capture fine-grained,
genre-specific rhythm patterns. Second, a \textbf{context-aware temporal
alignment} module resolves temporal mismatches using learnable context queries
to align music latents with relevant dance rhythm features. Extensive
experiments on the AIST++ and TikTok datasets demonstrate that GACA-DiT
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and human
evaluation. Project page: https://beria-moon.github.io/GACA-DiT/.

*Unzela Talpur,Zafi Sherhan Syed,Muhammad Shehram Shah Syed,Abbas Shah Syed*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This study focuses on Urdu Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), using a cross-corpus evaluation to assess model robustness, highlighting the overestimation of performance in self-corpus validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) for Urdu, a low-resource language, especially in cross-corpus evaluation scenarios, which are largely unexplored.

Method: The study uses three Urdu emotional speech datasets in a cross-corpus evaluation framework, employing domain-knowledge based acoustic feature sets (eGeMAPS, ComParE). Classification is carried out using Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers, with performance evaluated using Unweighted Average Recall (UAR).

Result: Results reveal that self-corpus validation overestimates performance, with UAR exceeding cross-corpus evaluation by up to 13%, emphasizing cross-corpus evaluation as a better indicator of model robustness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical importance of cross-corpus validation for Urdu SER and its broader implications for advancing affective computing for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a key affective computing technology that
enables emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence. While SER is
challenging in general, it is particularly difficult for low-resource languages
such as Urdu. This study investigates Urdu SER in a cross-corpus setting, an
area that has remained largely unexplored. We employ a cross-corpus evaluation
framework across three different Urdu emotional speech datasets to test model
generalization. Two standard domain-knowledge based acoustic feature sets,
eGeMAPS and ComParE, are used to represent speech signals as feature vectors
which are then passed to Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron
classifiers. Classification performance is assessed using unweighted average
recall (UAR) whilst considering class-label imbalance. Results show that
Self-corpus validation often overestimates performance, with UAR exceeding
cross-corpus evaluation by up to 13%, underscoring that cross-corpus evaluation
offers a more realistic measure of model robustness. Overall, this work
emphasizes the importance of cross-corpus validation for Urdu SER and its
implications contribute to advancing affective computing research for
underrepresented language communities.

*Jonathan Morse,Azadeh Naderi,Swen Gaudl,Mark Cartwright,Amy K. Hoover,Mark J. Nelson*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper adapts expressive range analysis (ERA) to assess the outputs of text-to-audio models, analyzing key acoustic dimensions like pitch and loudness in generated audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the capability and variability of text-to-audio models, aiming to understand their generative outputs as they are increasingly used for multimodal creative tasks in games.

Method: The work adapts the Expressive Range Analysis (ERA) technique, where text-to-audio models are prompted with fixed inputs (derived from the ESC-50 dataset), and their audio outputs are analyzed across acoustic dimensions.

Result: The analysis determines how the text-to-audio models perform on standardized prompts by evaluating pitch, loudness, and timbre in their generated audio.

Conclusion: This paper provides a framework for using ERA to explore and evaluate generative audio models, addressing discrepancies and variability in their outputs.

Abstract: Text-to-audio models are a type of generative model that produces audio
output in response to a given textual prompt. Although level generators and the
properties of the functional content that they create (e.g., playability)
dominate most discourse in procedurally generated content (PCG), games that
emotionally resonate with players tend to weave together a range of creative
and multimodal content (e.g., music, sounds, visuals, narrative tone), and
multimodal models have begun seeing at least experimental use for this purpose.
However, it remains unclear what exactly such models generate, and with what
degree of variability and fidelity: audio is an extremely broad class of output
for a generative system to target.
  Within the PCG community, expressive range analysis (ERA) has been used as a
quantitative way to characterize generators' output space, especially for level
generators. This paper adapts ERA to text-to-audio models, making the analysis
tractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed
prompts. Experiments are conducted by prompting the models with several
standardized prompts derived from the Environmental Sound Classification
(ESC-50) dataset. The resulting audio is analyzed along key acoustic dimensions
(e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre). More broadly, this paper offers a
framework for ERA-based exploratory evaluation of generative audio models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AVSE framework to enhance speech quality in complex environments, achieving top results in the AVSEC-4 Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in extracting target speech in complex acoustic environments, improving both perceptual quality and performance.

Method: Introduced a 'separation before dereverberation' pipeline for AVSE tasks and validated it through the AVSEC competition.

Result: Achieved top performance in objective metrics on the leaderboard and first place in human subjective tests in AVSEC-4.

Conclusion: The proposed AVSE system effectively enhances speech quality even in challenging acoustic settings, demonstrating superior performance in real-world scenarios and competitions.

Abstract: Audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) is a task that uses visual auxiliary
information to extract a target speaker's speech from mixed audio. In
real-world scenarios, there often exist complex acoustic environments,
accompanied by various interfering sounds and reverberation. Most previous
methods struggle to cope with such complex conditions, resulting in poor
perceptual quality of the extracted speech. In this paper, we propose an
effective AVSE system that performs well in complex acoustic environments.
Specifically, we design a "separation before dereverberation" pipeline that can
be extended to other AVSE networks. The 4th COGMHEAR Audio-Visual Speech
Enhancement Challenge (AVSEC) aims to explore new approaches to speech
processing in multimodal complex environments. We validated the performance of
our system in AVSEC-4: we achieved excellent results in the three objective
metrics on the competition leaderboard, and ultimately secured first place in
the human subjective listening test.

*A. V. Bomediano,R. J. Conanan,L. D. Santuyo,A. Coronel*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph-based computational method to analyze how listeners perceive musical structure, focusing on segmentation and labeling based on cognitive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to bridge traditional music theory methods and computational models to understand how listeners perceive and anticipate musical compositions.

Method: The authors develop a graph-based approach to segment melodies and annotate them using cognitive models, utilizing methods like Dynamic Time Warping, k-nearest neighbors graphs, Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel, and Graph2vec embeddings.

Result: Their method shows measurable differences between intra- and inter-graph structures, structural similarity that mirrors perceptual similarity, and effective stylistic/structural feature capture independent of composer identity.

Conclusion: Graph-based computational methods offer a robust and cognitively grounded framework for analyzing music, enabling insights into musical structure and listener perception variations.

Abstract: Understanding the structural and cognitive underpinnings of musical
compositions remains a key challenge in music theory and computational
musicology. While traditional methods focus on harmony and rhythm, cognitive
models such as the Implication-Realization (I-R) model and Temporal Gestalt
theory offer insight into how listeners perceive and anticipate musical
structure. This study presents a graph-based computational approach that
operationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and
annotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic
Time Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and
inter-segment relationships.
  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further
labeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor
I-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level.
This labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive
information, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and
resolution.
  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the
Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within
compositions. Results reveal statistically significant distinctions between
intra- and inter-graph structures. Segment-level analysis via multidimensional
scaling confirms that structural similarity at the graph level reflects
perceptual similarity at the segment level. Graph2vec embeddings and clustering
demonstrate that these representations capture stylistic and structural
features that extend beyond composer identity.
  These findings highlight the potential of graph-based methods as a
structured, cognitively informed framework for computational music analysis,
enabling a more nuanced understanding of musical structure and style through
the lens of listener perception.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper establishes the link between MMSE denoising and regularization by expressing the MMSE denoiser as the upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, analyzing weak convexity, and providing a sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP proximal gradient descent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structure and properties of the regularizer induced by MMSE denoisers in PnP methods, and address gaps related to the regularizer's characterization and convergence guarantees.

Method: Theoretical derivation of the link between MMSE denoising and weak convex regularizers, and providing the first sublinear convergence analysis for PnP proximal gradient descent using the MMSE denoiser. Experimental validation using synthetic and imaging-based studies.

Result: The study provides the first sublinear convergence guarantee for PnP methods with MMSE denoising. Experiments confirmed the theoretical prediction of sublinear convergence behavior in imaging tasks such as deblurring and computed tomography.

Conclusion: The MMSE denoiser corresponds to a 1-weakly convex regularizer, enabling sublinear convergence for PnP proximal gradient descent and expanding the theoretical understanding of implicit regularization in PnP methods.

Abstract: It is known that the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) denoiser under
Gaussian noise can be written as a proximal operator, which suffices for
asymptotic convergence of plug-and-play (PnP) methods but does not reveal the
structure of the induced regularizer or give convergence rates. We show that
the MMSE denoiser corresponds to a regularizer that can be written explicitly
as an upper Moreau envelope of the negative log-marginal density, which in turn
implies that the regularizer is 1-weakly convex. Using this property, we derive
(to the best of our knowledge) the first sublinear convergence guarantee for
PnP proximal gradient descent with an MMSE denoiser. We validate the theory
with a one-dimensional synthetic study that recovers the implicit regularizer.
We also validate the theory with imaging experiments (deblurring and computed
tomography), which exhibit the predicted sublinear behavior.

### [334] [AURA: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for AI-Driven Adaptive Conversational Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27126)
*Jinwen Tang,Yi Shang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces AURA, a reinforcement learning framework providing adaptive conversational surveys that improve response quality in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional and AI survey chatbots, which fail to adapt dynamically and lead to low engagement and weak response quality.

Method: AURA employs reinforcement learning with an LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, Specificity) and an epsilon-greedy policy to update expected response quality gains during conversations.

Result: AURA achieved a significant improvement in response quality with a +0.12 mean gain, surpassing non-adaptive baselines, and showcasing enhanced adaptivity in evaluations.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning enables AI survey systems to transition from static methods to interactive, adaptive frameworks that improve engagement and response quality.

Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting
in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots
improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees
or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit
individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality.
We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through
Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for
AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality
using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and
Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy
that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with
priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total
chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation
across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual
participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12
mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over
non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in
specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results
demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved
adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving
assessment systems.

### [335] [Reconstructing Unseen Sentences from Speech-related Biosignals for Open-vocabulary Neural Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27247)
*Deok-Seon Kim,Seo-Hyun Lee,Kang Yin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores EEG-based speech synthesis to decode unconstrained sentences for advancing open-vocabulary brain-to-speech systems aimed at enhancing neural communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop neural communication systems enabling speech decoding from brain signals for natural human interaction, especially for diverse patient communication and rehabilitation.

Method: Phoneme-level decoding of unseen sentences using high-density EEG signals, combined with EMG signals, to synthesize speech across different modes and examine factors affecting accuracy.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of sentence reconstruction via biosignal-based speech synthesis, achieving accurate decoding and providing neurophysiological insights for optimization.

Conclusion: The study showcases significant advancements towards open-vocabulary neural communication systems and offers insights for EEG-based communication and rehabilitation solutions tailored to patient needs.

Abstract: Brain-to-speech (BTS) systems represent a groundbreaking approach to human
communication by enabling the direct transformation of neural activity into
linguistic expressions. While recent non-invasive BTS studies have largely
focused on decoding predefined words or sentences, achieving open-vocabulary
neural communication comparable to natural human interaction requires decoding
unconstrained speech. Additionally, effectively integrating diverse signals
derived from speech is crucial for developing personalized and adaptive neural
communication and rehabilitation solutions for patients. This study
investigates the potential of speech synthesis for previously unseen sentences
across various speech modes by leveraging phoneme-level information extracted
from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals, both independently and
in conjunction with electromyography (EMG) signals. Furthermore, we examine the
properties affecting phoneme decoding accuracy during sentence reconstruction
and offer neurophysiological insights to further enhance EEG decoding for more
effective neural communication solutions. Our findings underscore the
feasibility of biosignal-based sentence-level speech synthesis for
reconstructing unseen sentences, highlighting a significant step toward
developing open-vocabulary neural communication systems adapted to diverse
patient needs and conditions. Additionally, this study provides meaningful
insights into the development of communication and rehabilitation solutions
utilizing EEG-based decoding technologies.

### [336] [Domain decomposition architectures and Gauss-Newton training for physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27018)
*Alexander Heinlein,Taniya Kapoor*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in solving boundary value problems with neural networks by localizing using domain decomposition and improving convergence with the Gauss-Newton method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural networks to solve boundary value problems governed by partial differential equations is difficult due to issues like spectral bias.

Method: The authors used domain decomposition for localization and employed Gauss-Newton optimization, which leverages block-sparse structures to reduce computational cost.

Result: Their findings show that combining localization with Gauss-Newton optimization provides faster convergence for solving these equations.

Conclusion: This combination is a promising approach for improving neural network-based solvers for complex differential equations.

Abstract: Approximating the solutions of boundary value problems governed by partial
differential equations with neural networks is challenging, largely due to the
difficult training process. This difficulty can be partly explained by the
spectral bias, that is, the slower convergence of high-frequency components,
and can be mitigated by localizing neural networks via (overlapping) domain
decomposition. We combine this localization with the Gauss-Newton method as the
optimizer to obtain faster convergence than gradient-based schemes such as
Adam; this comes at the cost of solving an ill-conditioned linear system in
each iteration. Domain decomposition induces a block-sparse structure in the
otherwise dense Gauss-Newton system, reducing the computational cost per
iteration. Our numerical results indicate that combining localization and
Gauss-Newton optimization is promising for neural network-based solvers for
partial differential equations.

*Gaoyuan Zhang,Ruisong Si,Boyuan Li,Zijian Li,Baofeng Ji,Chenqi Zhu,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a secure communication scheme to counter the threat of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced eavesdropper in MIMO wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to address security and robustness in MIMO wireless networks against mobile eavesdroppers using RIS for enhancing wiretapping capabilities.

Method: The paper develops a lightweight information-theoretic secure communication scheme involving random bit-flipping and SVD-based precoding to minimize eavesdropping effectiveness. RIS optimization from the eavesdropper's side is also explored.

Result: The scheme is shown to be effective and robust without requiring full instantaneous channel state information (ICSI) of the attacker through simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed secure communication approach provides a practical solution, showcasing its security and robustness against intelligent mobile eavesdroppers in varied attack scenarios.

Abstract: We pay our attention towards secure and robust communication in the presence
of a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced mobile eavesdropping
attacker in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)wireless
networks.Specifically,we first provide a unifying framework that generalizes
specific intelligent wiretap model wherein the passive eavesdropper configured
with any number of antennas is potentially mobile and can actively optimize its
received signal strength with the help of RIS by intelligently manipulating
wiretap channel characteristics.To effectively mitigate this intractable
threat,we then propose a novel and lightweight secure communication scheme from
the perspective of information theory.The main idea is that the data processing
can in some cases be observed as communication channel,and a random
bit-flipping scheme is then carefully involved for the legitimate transmitter
to minimize the mutual information between the secret message and the passive
eavesdropper's received data.The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based
precoding strategy is also implemented to optimize power allocation,and thus
ensure that the legitimate receiver is not subject to interference from this
random bit-flipping.The corresponding results depict that our secure
communication scheme is practically desired, which does not require any a prior
knowledge of the eavesdropper's full instantaneous Channel State Information
(ICSI). Furthermore,we consider the RIS optimization problem from the
eavesdropper's perspective,and provide RIS phase shift design solutions under
different attacking scenarios.Finally,the optimal detection schemes
respectively for the legitimate user and the eavesdropper are provided,and
comprehensive simulations are presented to verify our theoretical analysis and
show the effectiveness and robustness of our secure communication scheme across
a wide range of attacking scenarios.

### [338] [Byzantine Attacks in RIS-Enhanced Cooperative Spectrum Sensing: A Decision Fusion Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27175)
*Gaoyuan Zhang,Gaolei Song,Boyuan Li,Zijian Li,Baofeng Ji,Ruijuan Zheng,Guoqiang Zheng,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper investigates Byzantine attacks in RIS-enhanced and relay-assisted CSS in mobile Cognitive Radio Networks, proposing optimal attack strategies that do not rely on complete channel information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and mitigating Byzantine attacks in cooperative spectrum sensing is crucial for secure and efficient spectrum usage in cognitive radio networks.

Method: A RIS-enhanced and relay-assisted CSS framework under dynamic channel scenarios is constructed. Channel-aware hard decision fusion rules and optimal attack strategies are developed, supported by theoretical and simulation-based analyses.

Result: The results indicate that attackers can achieve optimal attack strategies without relying on detailed channel information (e.g., global ICSI). The effectiveness of attacks depends on the fraction of Byzantine nodes rather than channel dynamics.

Conclusion: The study relaxes dependency on precise channel and decision fusion knowledge for Byzantine attackers, providing insights into attack strategies and offering a unified framework to analyze scenarios.

Abstract: From the perspective of hard decision fusion, we investigate Byzantine
attacks in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) for mobile
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) in this paper. Specially, a RIS-enhanced and
decode-and-forward relay-assisted CSS configuration is first constructed under
dynamic channel scenarios due to user mobility. Subsequently, the channel- and
attack-aware hard decision fusion rules are developed, and the optimal
channel-aware Byzantine attack strategies are then developed under both
small-scale and large-scale attacking scenarios. The corresponding results
depict that the optimal attack strategy does not require any a prior knowledge
of the global instantaneous Channel State Information (ICSI) (e.g. false alarm
probability and detection probability of all the secondary users), although
perfect acquisition of ICSI is clearly always not affordable from the attacker
perspective, which is further exacerbated by the RIS and decode-and-forward
relays involved in CSS and the potential high mobility of secondary users that
leads to fast fading channels. Furthermore, our counterintuitive results also
indicate that, regardless of the attacker's awareness of the decision fusion
rule, the optimal Byzantine attack can be achieved through a unifying
framework, the explicit attack strategy may be not unique, and the attacking
effectiveness is primarily determined by the fraction of the Byzantine nodes
rather than the channel dynamics. That is, to make the channel-aware approach
more practical, the challenge that the heavy reliance on the global ICSI and
decision fusion rule in obtaining the Byzantine attacks is successfully
relaxed. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical analysis through
extensive simulations across a wide range of attacking scenarios.

### [339] [Systematic Absence of Low-Confidence Nighttime Fire Detections in VIIRS Active Fire Product: Evidence of Undocumented Algorithmic Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26816)
*Rohit Rajendra Dhage*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The VIIRS active fire product exhibits an undocumented systematic bias where nighttime fire detections are systematically excluded or flagged differently, affecting fire monitoring analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to uncover and address an undocumented systematic pattern in the confidence classification scheme of the VIIRS active fire product, which might affect fire risk assessments and related research.

Method: The study analyzes 21,540,921 fire detections over one year using machine learning reverse-engineering, bootstrap simulation, and spatial-temporal analysis to identify and confirm the systematic bias in the VIIRS algorithms.

Result: Nighttime fires below 295K brightness temperature are excluded rather than flagged as low-confidence, resulting in 27.9% of nighttime detections being affected globally and across all monitoring systems.

Conclusion: Explicit documentation of the algorithmic constraint in VIIRS user guides and reprocessing strategies are recommended to ensure accurate fire risk assessments and scientific analyses.

Abstract: The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire product is
widely used for global fire monitoring, yet its confidence classification
scheme exhibits an undocumented systematic pattern. Through analysis of
21,540,921 fire detections spanning one year (January 2023 - January 2024), I
demonstrate a complete absence of low-confidence classifications during
nighttime observations. Of 6,007,831 nighttime fires, zero were classified as
low confidence, compared to an expected 696,908 under statistical independence
(chi-squared = 1,474,795, p < 10^-15, Z = -833). This pattern persists globally
across all months, latitude bands, and both NOAA-20 and Suomi-NPP satellites.
Machine learning reverse-engineering (88.9% accuracy), bootstrap simulation
(1,000 iterations), and spatial-temporal analysis confirm this is an
algorithmic constraint rather than a geophysical phenomenon. Brightness
temperature analysis reveals nighttime fires below approximately 295K are
likely excluded entirely rather than flagged as low-confidence, while daytime
fires show normal confidence distributions. This undocumented behavior affects
27.9% of all VIIRS fire detections and has significant implications for fire
risk assessment, day-night detection comparisons, confidence-weighted analyses,
and any research treating confidence levels as uncertainty metrics. I recommend
explicit documentation of this algorithmic constraint in VIIRS user guides and
reprocessing strategies for affected analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to address challenges in delivering personalized lifestyle medicine prescriptions for type 2 diabetes due to limited professionals and inconsistent expertise among physicians.

Method: An offline contextual bandit model was trained using aggregated NHANES data (119,555 participants), leveraging the Magni glucose risk-reward function and a mixed-action Soft Actor-Critic algorithm.

Result: The proposed model successfully generated lifestyle medicine prescriptions and demonstrated comparable results to those issued by certified physicians at Xiangya Hospital.

Conclusion: The study suggests the potential of the mixed-action SAC approach in creating effective, risk-aware lifestyle prescriptions, highlighting the need for further clinical validation.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment can benefit from personalized
lifestyle prescriptions. However, the delivery of personalized lifestyle
medicine prescriptions is limited by the shortage of trained professionals and
the variability in physicians' expertise. We propose an offline contextual
bandit approach that learns individualized lifestyle prescriptions from the
aggregated NHANES profiles of 119,555 participants by minimizing the Magni
glucose risk-reward function. The model encodes patient status and generates
lifestyle medicine prescriptions, which are trained using a mixed-action Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm. The task is treated as a single-step contextual bandit.
The model is validated against lifestyle medicine prescriptions issued by three
certified physicians from Xiangya Hospital. These results demonstrate that
offline mixed-action SAC can generate risk-aware lifestyle medicine
prescriptions from cross-sectional NHANES data, warranting prospective clinical
validation.

TL;DR: The study presents a machine learning framework to reduce the 77-item Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) while maintaining accuracy, aiding frequent assessments of individuals with ASD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Caregivers find the 77-item ATEC burdensome, limiting routine monitoring of therapy progress and severity in individuals with ASD.

Method: The framework used feature selection, subset optimization, and cross-validation on longitudinal ATEC data from 60 autistic children to identify predictive item subsets for therapy tracking and severity assessments.

Result: For therapy monitoring, 16 items were identified that retained correlation with score changes; subsets of 1-7 items were created for approximations. For severity assessment, 13 items achieved over 80% accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology simplifies psychometric tools like ATEC, enabling frequent, scalable assessments and advancing AI-supported interventions in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric areas.

Abstract: Caregivers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often find the
77-item Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) burdensome, limiting its
use for routine monitoring. This study introduces a generalizable machine
learning framework that seeks to shorten assessments while maintaining
evaluative accuracy. Using longitudinal ATEC data from 60 autistic children
receiving therapy, we applied feature selection and cross-validation techniques
to identify the most predictive items across two assessment goals: longitudinal
therapy tracking and point-in-time severity estimation. For progress
monitoring, the framework identified 16 items (21% of the original
questionnaire) that retained strong correlation with total score change and
full subdomain coverage. We also generated smaller subsets (1-7 items) for
efficient approximations. For point-in-time severity assessment, our model
achieved over 80% classification accuracy using just 13 items (17% of the
original set). While demonstrated on ATEC, the methodology-based on subset
optimization, model interpretability, and statistical rigor-is broadly
applicable to other high-dimensional psychometric tools. The resulting
framework could potentially enable more accessible, frequent, and scalable
assessments and offer a data-driven approach for AI-supported interventions
across neurodevelopmental and psychiatric contexts.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Gaussian Processes (GP) modeling to predict insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels from irregularly sampled longitudinal data in childhood cancer survivors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of infrequent, irregular, and potentially inaccurate longitudinal data collected during routine monitoring of side effects in childhood cancer survivors.

Method: The study employs Gaussian Processes (GP) modeling to analyze IGF-1 measurements, using data from 23 patients for training and 8 test cases for evaluation.

Result: The model identified trends consistent with reported literature values and achieved individual predictions with an average root mean squared error of 31.9 ng/ml and 27.4 ng/ml using two different approaches.

Conclusion: GP modeling shows promise in overcoming the limitations of irregular and sparse longitudinal data, enabling better analysis and prediction of late effects of radiotherapy.

Abstract: Survivors of childhood cancer need lifelong monitoring for side effects from
radiotherapy. However, longitudinal data from routine monitoring is often
infrequently and irregularly sampled, and subject to inaccuracies. Due to this,
measurements are often studied in isolation, or simple relationships (e.g.,
linear) are used to impute missing timepoints. In this study, we investigated
the potential role of Gaussian Processes (GP) modelling to make
population-based and individual predictions, using insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF-1) measurements as a test case. With training data of 23 patients with a
median (range) of 4 (1-16) timepoints we identified a trend within the range of
literature reported values. In addition, with 8 test cases, individual
predictions were made with an average root mean squared error of 31.9 (10.1 -
62.3) ng/ml and 27.4 (0.02 - 66.1) ng/ml for two approaches. GP modelling may
overcome limitations of routine longitudinal data and facilitate analysis of
late effects of radiotherapy.

*Dipal Shah,Jordon Wade,Timothy Haithcoat,Robert Myers,Kelly Wilson*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a regional soil clustering framework to improve soil health management in Missouri using data-driven methods and precise clustering for practical usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge posed by Missouri's diverse landscapes that limit the effectiveness of general soil management recommendations, requiring tailored and site-specific solutions for better agricultural practices and ecosystem management.

Method: They used high-resolution SSURGO datasets to analyze soil properties in the root zone, employing a variational autoencoder and KMeans clustering for grouping similar soils. Statistical metrics validated the clusters.

Result: Ten distinct soil health management zones were identified with unique soil characteristics. They optimized zones to balance soil pattern complexity and practical statewide implementation.

Conclusion: The study enables data-driven, targeted soil management strategies, improving resource efficiency and aiding agronomists in conserving Missouri’s agroecological systems effectively.

Abstract: Effective soil health management is crucial for sustaining agriculture,
adopting ecosystem resilience, and preserving water quality. However,
Missouri's diverse landscapes limit the effectiveness of broad generalized
management recommendations. The lack of resolution in existing soil grouping
systems necessitates data driven, site specific insights to guide tailored
interventions. To address these critical challenges, a regional soil clustering
framework designed to support precision soil health management strategies
across the state. The methodology leveraged high resolution SSURGO dataset,
explicitly processing soil properties aggregated across the 0 to 30 cm root
zone. Multivariate analysis incorporating a variational autoencoder and KMeans
clustering was used to group soils with similar properties. The derived
clusters were validated using statistical metrics, including silhouette scores
and checks against existing taxonomic units, to confirm their spatial
coherence. This approach enabled us to delineate soil groups that capture
textures, hydraulic properties, chemical fertility, and biological indicators
unique to Missouri's diverse agroecological regions. The clustering map
identified ten distinct soil health management zones. This alignment of 10
clusters was selected as optimal because it was sufficiently large to capture
inherited soil patterns while remaining manageable for practical statewide
application. Rooting depth limitation and saturated hydraulic conductivity
emerged as principal variables driving soil differentiation. Each management
zone is defined by a unique combination of clay, organic matter, pH, and
available water capacity. This framework bridges sophisticated data analysis
with actionable, site targeted recommendations, enabling conservation planners,
and agronomists to optimize management practices and enhance resource
efficiency statewide.
