Consequently, the creation of secure\npasswords constitutes a fundamental aspect of enhancing overall system security\nand protecting personal data. In response to these challenges, this study\npresents a secure password generation approach utilizing a cryptographically\nsecure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). The generator is implemented\nusing a range of Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms, including the\nKeyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC), Cipher-based Message\nAuthentication Code (CMAC), and KECCAK Message Authentication Code (KMAC), to\nproduce robust random values suitable for password generation. To evaluate the\nproposed method, empirical assessments were conducted in accordance with the\nguidelines provided in the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-90B.

Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper identifies challenges of entropy regularization in LLM-RL settings and proposes a novel method called AEnt that adjusts entropy control for effective exploration and improved performance.", "motivation": "To address the inefficacy of conventional entropy regularization methods in training large language model-reinforcement learning (LLM-RL) systems due to vast response spaces and sparse optimal outputs.", "method": "AEnt, a novel entropy control method, employs clamped entropy bonus measured over a smaller token space and dynamically adjusts the entropy coefficient based on the clamped entropy value.", "result": "AEnt demonstrated consistent improvements over baseline methods in math-reasoning tasks across multiple models and datasets.", "conclusion": "The proposed AEnt method effectively manages policy entropy in LLM-RL setups, offering better exploration and addressing challenges inherent to large response spaces."}}

A particularly notable approach for\ndata-driven regularization is to use learned image denoisers as implicit priors\nin iterative image reconstruction algorithms. This survey presents a\ncomprehensive overview of this powerful and emerging class of algorithms,\ncommonly referred to as plug-and-play (PnP) methods. We begin by providing a\nbrief background on image denoising and inverse problems, followed by a short\nreview of traditional regularization strategies. We then explore how proximal\nsplitting algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) and proximal gradient descent (PGD), can naturally accommodate learned\ndenoisers in place of proximal operators, and under what conditions such\nreplacements preserve convergence. The role of Tweedie's formula in connecting\noptimal Gaussian denoisers and score estimation is discussed, which lays the\nfoundation for regularization-by-denoising (RED) and more recent\ndiffusion-based posterior sampling methods. We discuss theoretical advances\nregarding the convergence of PnP algorithms, both within the RED and proximal\nsettings, emphasizing the structural assumptions that the denoiser must satisfy\nfor convergence, such as non-expansiveness, Lipschitz continuity, and local\nhomogeneity. We also address practical considerations in algorithm design,\nincluding choices of denoiser architecture and acceleration strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reviews plug-and-play (PnP) methods for solving inverse problems in imaging by integrating data-driven image denoisers into iterative reconstruction algorithms.", "motivation": "Inverse problems in modern imaging science have broad applications but are challenging to solve, motivating the use of data-driven techniques for higher fidelity solutions.", "method": "The authors survey PnP methods, which replace traditional regularization by incorporating learned denoisers into proximal splitting algorithms like ADMM and PGD, while examining theoretical and practical aspects for convergence.", "result": "The survey offers a comprehensive understanding of PnP methods, including theoretical advances and conditions for algorithmic convergence, as well as practical tips for denoiser design and acceleration strategies.", "conclusion": "PnP methods represent a powerful approach for imaging inverse problems, blending theory and practice to leverage advanced image denoisers for regularization and reconstruction."}}
