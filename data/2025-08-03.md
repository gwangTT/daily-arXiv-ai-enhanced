### [1] [Unifying Post-hoc Explanations of Knowledge Graph Completions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22951)
*Alessandro Lonardi,Samy Badreddine,Tarek R. Besold,Pablo Sanchez Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework for post-hoc explainability in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) to enhance reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of formalization and consistent evaluations in post-hoc explainability for KGC complicates reproducibility and the comparison of research across studies.

Method: The paper introduces a multi-objective optimization framework to balance the effectiveness and conciseness of KGC explanations, and refines evaluation protocols with metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$.

Result: The study empirically supports the proposed evaluation protocols and unifies existing post-hoc explainability algorithms for KGC.

Conclusion: By unifying methods and improving evaluation standards, the work contributes to advancing reproducibility and the overall impact of research in KGC explainability.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

### [2] [Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018)
*Wesley Brewer,Patrick Widener,Valentine Anantharaj,Feiyi Wang,Tom Beck,Arjun Shankar,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-dimensional readiness framework for transforming scientific data into AI-ready formats, focusing on high-performance computing and cross-domain applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in preparing leadership-scale scientific datasets for training foundational AI models across multiple scientific domains.

Method: The authors propose a conceptual maturity matrix built on two dimensions: Data Readiness Levels (from raw to AI-ready) and Data Processing Stages (from ingest to shard), tailored for high-performance computing.

Result: The readiness framework identifies common preprocessing workflows, domain-specific constraints, and key challenges, offering guidance for standardized and reproducible AI in scientific research.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable AI training by providing a structured approach to data readiness, promoting cross-domain standardization for scientific datasets used in AI.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a balance between reducing social biases and maintaining reasoning accuracy in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), using a 1:4 mix of debias-focused and reasoning-centric training data with reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance, they often suffer from pronounced social biases, even as advanced techniques improve their reasoning accuracy. This paper seeks to understand and address the trade-off between bias mitigation and reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study benchmarks three bias-mitigation strategies—supervised fine-tuning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). It then varies the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples for each technique to explore the trade-off between reducing bias and enhancing reasoning.

Result: Through experimentation, the authors find that a 1:4 mix of debias-focused to reasoning-centric data combined with reinforcement learning can reduce stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the original reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings provide a practical framework for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs, demonstrating that the trade-off between reducing biases and maintaining performance is manageable under specific training conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper shows that current AI struggles with auditory tasks, achieving a high failure rate over 93% in challenges that humans solve much better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the fact that auditory tasks, which humans find simple, remain a major challenge for AI due to issues like selective attention and noise robustness.

Method: An auditory Turing test with 917 tasks across seven categories was introduced and state-of-the-art audio models, like GPT-4’s audio capabilities and Whisper, were evaluated.

Result: AI audio models showed a catastrophic failure rate exceeding 93%, with humans outperforming machines significantly.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical failures in AI auditory processing and provides a benchmark to guide improvement efforts towards human-like auditory scene analysis.

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [5] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of argumentative coherence in judgmental forecasting, demonstrating its value by improving prediction accuracy and emphasizing the need for filtering incoherent opinions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reliability and consistency of forecasts made based on human opinions, especially as Large Language Models (LLMs) become competitive with human forecasters.

Method: The authors formally define the property of argumentative coherence and conduct evaluations on human forecasters and LLM-based forecasters, as well as crowd-sourced experiments to analyze users' alignment with coherence.

Result: They show that enforcing coherence improves forecasting accuracy for both human and LLM-based forecasters but reveal that users do not naturally align with coherence principles.

Conclusion: Argumentative coherence is crucial for improving forecasting accuracy in judgmental forecasting, and mechanisms should be implemented to filter incoherent opinions in group predictions.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [6] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines the computational complexity of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures in ontology-mediated query answering, identifying cases of polynomial complexity and intractability under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the complexity of computing responsibility scores that quantify individual contributions of facts to query answers, particularly in the ontology-mediated query answering context.

Method: Employing theoretical analysis, leveraging database results, and examining specific ontology languages and query types to assess computational complexity and identify tractable cases for WSMS computation.

Result: Polynomial data complexity is possible for certain first-order-rewritable queries, but intractability arises for queries involving conjunction or specific ontologies. Positive results for tractable computation are identified for some DL-Lite dialects under structural restrictions on conjunctive queries.

Conclusion: The study delineates the tractability frontier of WSMS computation in ontology-mediated queries, offering insights into both hard cases and tractable structures for practical computation.

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [7] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper revisits a divide-and-conquer approach for handling complex instances in neural network verification, focusing on selecting key ReLU variables using novel scoring methods. This approach improves efficiency and accuracy for verification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of neural network verification by reducing the computational burden of handling complex instances using partial MILP calls, focusing on key ReLU variables.

Method: The method involves introducing a solution-aware ReLU scoring (SAS) and adapting branching functions to act as global ReLU scoring (GS) functions. These select crucial ReLUs for handling with binary variables in a divide-and-conquer setup, implemented within Hybrid MILP combined with timeout-based $\/alpha, \beta$-CROWN calls.

Result: SAS reduces binary variables by around 6 times while maintaining accuracy. The Hybrid MILP system achieves significant performance improvements, reducing undecided instances by up to 40% (to 8-15%) while maintaining reasonable runtime for large CNNs.

Conclusion: The proposed SAS and Hybrid MILP approach offers an accurate and efficient solution for neural network verification, handling large and complex models effectively with reduced computational effort.

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

phenomena previously unknown to humans, may soon become a reality. In this
survey, we focus on the central question: How far are AI scientists from
changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer
this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

### [9] [AI Must not be Fully Autonomous](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23330)
*Tosin Adewumi,Lama Alkhaled,Florent Imbert,Hui Han,Nudrat Habib,Karl Löwenmark*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the risks of fully autonomous AI, argues against its deployment without human oversight, and discusses 12 arguments, counterarguments, and rebuttals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the risks associated with autonomous AI, considering the potential development of artificial superintelligence and its implications.

Method: The paper categorizes AI into three levels of autonomy, delves into theories of autonomy and AI, analyzes arguments and counterarguments, and uses recent evidence on misaligned AI values.

Result: The study highlights 12 distinct arguments against fully autonomous AI, presents counterarguments and their rebuttals, and includes evidence of risks in the appendix.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that fully autonomous AI should be avoided due to its risks, emphasizing the importance of responsible human oversight.

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

*Ram Mohan Rao Kadiyala,Siddhant Gupta,Jebish Purbey,Giulio Martini,Suman Debnath,Hamza Farooq*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating data science agents' performance using LLMs in realistic settings, comparing three models and approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the lack of systematic benchmarks for assessing data science agents driven by large language models, despite their increasing adoption in analytical tasks.

Method: The authors propose a benchmark designed from observing real-world usage of commercial applications. They test three LLMs and evaluate them on eight data science task categories using three methodological approaches, while also analyzing sensitivities to various input issues.

Result: The study identifies performance differences among the models and approaches, as well as factors such as the impact of temperature parameters on task-specific outcomes.

Conclusion: The benchmark and evaluation framework aim to drive future research for building more robust and effective data science agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance individualized railway service through the integration of large language models.

Method: Introduce the "QTAO" prompting framework and create the CRFD-25 dataset for railway food recommendations.

Result: LLM4Rail successfully provides accurate and personalized services, supported by the CRFD-25 dataset and feature-matching frameworks.

Conclusion: LLM4Rail demonstrates that LLM-based solutions can improve railway services, showing potential for scalable and personalized applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

### [13] [Self-Foveate: Enhancing Diversity and Difficulty of Synthesized Instructions from Unsupervised Text via Multi-Level Foveation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23440)
*Mingzhe Li,Xin Lu,Yanyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Self-Foveate,' a new method for synthesizing instructional data leveraging LLMs, aiming to enhance the diversity and difficulty of instructions while reducing reliance on human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of existing methods in synthesizing instructional data, particularly the lack of diversity and difficulty in instructions, while reducing human involvement in data annotation.

Method: The proposed method, 'Self-Foveate,' uses a 'Micro-Scatter-Macro' multi-level foveation methodology. This guides an LLM to deeply analyze fine-grained information from unsupervised text to create more diverse and challenging instructional data.

Result: Through experiments on different unsupervised corpora and various model architectures, the method showed enhanced effectiveness in synthesizing instructional data compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed 'Self-Foveate' method successfully improves the quality of instructional data synthesis and demonstrates its superiority via extensive experiments. The authors released their data and codes publicly to support further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

### [14] [Causal Reasoning in Pieces: Modular In-Context Learning for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23488)
*Kacper Kadziolka,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates advanced language models' ability to perform causal discovery using a new benchmark and presents a modular reasoning pipeline that drastically improves performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional models in causal discovery, such as severe overfitting and poor performance under data perturbations.

Method: The study uses advanced reasoning models from OpenAI's o-series and DeepSeek-R families, introduces a modular reasoning pipeline inspired by Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) methodologies, and examines different reasoning complexities and lengths.

Result: Advanced reasoning models achieve significant gains on the Corr2Cause benchmark, and the modular pipeline improves performance nearly three-fold over conventional baselines.

Conclusion: Structured in-context reasoning frameworks are essential for unlocking advanced causal discovery capabilities and serve as a generalizable methodology for various domains.

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

Motivation: To address the lack of formal rigor in existing explanation methods for image classifiers and the limitations of logic-based explanations that rely on strict, impractical assumptions.

Method: Causal explanations and contrastive causal explanations are proposed, augmented with confidence-awareness, and supported by formal properties. The explanation framework is implemented using black-box algorithms with no reliance on model internals.

Result: The proposed algorithms are computationally efficient (6s per image on ResNet50) and demonstrate distinct patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and completeness across models.

Conclusion: Causal explanations provide a rigorous, black-box, and computationally tractable framework for understanding image classifiers, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

### [16] [DICE: Dynamic In-Context Example Selection in LLM Agents via Efficient Knowledge Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23554)
*Ruoyu Wang,Junda Wu,Yu Xia,Tong Yu,Ryan A. Rossi,Julian McAuley,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DICE, a method to improve large language model (LLM) agent performance through dynamic example selection during in-context learning (ICL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the sensitivity of LLM performance to the choice of demonstrations during in-context learning, as suboptimal examples can degrade the outcomes.

Method: The proposed DICE framework uses a causal approach to distinguish transferable from non-transferable demonstration knowledge, guiding stepwise example selection to enhance agent reasoning.

Result: Experiments across various domains show DICE's effectiveness in boosting performance, stability, and efficiency for LLM agents in agentic tasks.

Conclusion: DICE serves as a theoretically principled and general solution, easily integrable into existing frameworks, to improve context-aware demonstration selection without additional training costs.

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

### [17] [Semantic Chain-of-Trust: Autonomous Trust Orchestration for Collaborator Selection via Hypergraph-Aided Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23565)
*Botao Zhu,Xianbin Wang,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses task-specific trust evaluation challenges in collaborative systems by proposing an autonomous trust orchestration method using agentic AI and trust hypergraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome inefficiencies caused by frequent or untimely trust evaluations, which hinder task execution in distributed collaborative environments.

Method: The method uses agentic AI for idle-time trust evaluations, hypergraphs to manage trust hierarchies, semantic reasoning, and multi-hop collaboration capability.

Result: Experimental results show that their approach improves resource efficiency in trust evaluation processes.

Conclusion: The proposed technique balances evaluation overhead with trust accuracy, enabling efficient task execution in large-scale distributed systems.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

### [18] [MemoCue: Empowering LLM-Based Agents for Human Memory Recall via Strategy-Guided Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23633)
*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MemoCue, a method to enhance agent-assisted memory recall using a strategy-guided approach, improving upon conventional memory modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in conventional memory recall agents, whose restricted memory modules hinder effective recall performance. It builds on memory theories suggesting proactive activation of memories through cues.

Method: The authors propose a Recall Router framework, including a 5W Recall Map for classifying memory queries and Monte Carlo Tree Search for strategy optimization. MemoCue agents are fine-tuned using open-source large language models.

Result: MemoCue improves recall inspiration by 17.74% over LLM-based methods in experiments involving three datasets, and human evaluations endorse its advantages in memory-recall.

Conclusion: MemoCue represents an effective solution for agent-assisted memory recall through its novel strategy-guided methodology, significantly enhancing recall capability and practicality.

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

*Haipeng Liu,Yuxuan Liu,Ting Long*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), a framework aimed at improving personalized question recommendation by tackling exploration inefficiencies in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for personalized question recommendation struggle with effective exploration during training, which limits their ability to identify optimal questions for students.

Method: RAR integrates collaborative ideas into exploration mechanisms, enhancing the efficiency of exploration in reinforcement learning-based question recommendation systems.

Result: Experiments show that RAR improves recommendation performance and enhances the efficiency of RL-based systems.

Conclusion: RAR is a promising framework that can effectively improve personalized question recommendation and is adaptable to any RL-based systems.

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

*Long Phan,Mantas Mazeika,Andy Zou,Dan Hendrycks*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TextQuests, a benchmark based on text-based interactive fiction games, to evaluate AI agents' autonomous reasoning in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for AI agents often lack the ability to measure autonomous operation in exploratory environments that involve sustained reasoning over growing contexts.

Method: TextQuests leverages interactive fiction games that require extensive trial-and-error problem solving, focusing on long-context reasoning without external tools.

Result: The benchmark provides a framework to evaluate agents' problem-solving capabilities within a single interactive session using text-based environments.

Conclusion: TextQuests advances the assessment of AI agents' intrinsic reasoning capabilities in exploratory contexts, aiming to drive improvements in long-horizon AI reasoning skills.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Seed-Prover, a lemma-style reasoning model using reinforcement learning and Lean's formal verification, achieves significant performance in mathematical theorem proving, especially on contest problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models excel in mathematical reasoning but struggle with theorem proving, mainly due to inadequate supervision signals when using natural language alone.

Method: Seed-Prover leverages Lean's formal verification system to iteratively refine proofs through feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. It also introduces a geometry reasoning engine, Seed-Geometry, for addressing geometry-specific challenges.

Result: Seed-Prover achieved a 78.1% success rate on formalized IMO problems and excelled in benchmarks like MiniF2F and PutnamBench. Seed-Geometry improved geometry reasoning capability, significantly enhancing overall performance.

Conclusion: The combination of Seed-Prover and Seed-Geometry demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning capabilities, making strides in automated theorem proving and its application in high-level mathematical contests.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoT-Self-Instruct, a method for generating synthetic training data for LLMs using reasoning and filtering steps, achieving superior results in reasoning and instruction-following tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for high-quality synthetic training data for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring logical reasoning and instruction-following capabilities.

Method: The authors propose CoT-Self-Instruct, which uses Chain-of-Thought processes to generate synthetic prompts from seed tasks, followed by filtering for quality using automatic metrics.

Result: The method significantly improves performance on reasoning datasets such as MATH500, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond, and outperforms human and standard self-instruct prompts for instruction-following on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: CoT-Self-Instruct is an effective method to create synthetic training data that improves the performance of LLMs across reasoning and instruction-following tasks.

Abstract: We propose CoT-Self-Instruct, a synthetic data generation method that
instructs LLMs to first reason and plan via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on the
given seed tasks, and then to generate a new synthetic prompt of similar
quality and complexity for use in LLM training, followed by filtering for
high-quality data with automatic metrics. In verifiable reasoning, our
synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For
non-verifiable instruction-following tasks, our method surpasses the
performance of human or standard self-instruct prompts on both AlpacaEval 2.0
and Arena-Hard.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SimuRA, a goal-oriented AI architecture leveraging world-model simulation to overcome limitations of autoregressive reasoning, demonstrating improved performance, particularly in tasks like web browsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents based on language models are limited to a one-task-one-agent approach, lacking scalability, generality, and effective reasoning capabilities akin to humans.

Method: The methodology introduces SimuRA, which uses a world model integrated with large language models for simulation-based planning. This approach allows for reasoning in a variety of environments using natural language latent spaces.

Result: SimuRA achieved a significant performance improvement, such as increasing the success rate of flight searches from 0% to 32.2%, and demonstrated up to 124% advantage of world-model-based planning over autoregressive planning in web browsing tasks.

Conclusion: SimuRA is a promising step towards developing a general-purpose AI model capable of functioning across diverse environments, showcasing the potential of world-model-based reasoning paradigms with LLMs.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

TL;DR: The study evaluates two LLMs, Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, for improving property descriptions on a reservation platform, finding Mixtral to be more effective but costlier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of incomplete and inconsistent property data on booking platforms, which can frustrate users and affect market credibility.

Method: Evaluation of two LLMs—Mistral 7B (fine-tuned with QLoRA) and Mixtral 8x7B (refined system prompt)—for generating property descriptions, focusing on quality, completeness, and hallucination rates under resource constraints.

Result: Mixtral 8x7B outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision (98.8% vs. 96%), and lower hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), but required significantly more computational resources.

Conclusion: Mixtral 8x7B demonstrates better performance in improving data quality for reservation platforms, though its high cost highlights the trade-off between quality and efficiency. Practical insights for LLM deployment are provided.

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ElectriQ, a benchmark for enhancing domain-specific performance of LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios, aiming to address the limitations of existing customer service systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing electric power customer service systems face challenges like slow responses, inflexible procedures, and lack of domain expertise. Current LLMs are powerful but lack the required specialization and empathy.

Method: The authors created the ElectriQ benchmark, which includes a dialogue dataset covering six service categories and proposes evaluation metrics like professionalism and user-friendliness. They also used a domain-specific knowledge base and applied knowledge augmentation techniques.

Result: Experiments show fine-tuned smaller LLMs, such as LLama3-8B, outperform GPT-4o in key metrics like professionalism and user-friendliness within electric power marketing tasks.

Conclusion: ElectriQ provides a solid groundwork for developing specialized LLMs to better support the needs of electric power marketing services, showcasing that smaller models can excel when tailored effectively.

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

TL;DR: The paper develops a hierarchical classification framework for detecting illicit content across diverse platforms using fine-tuned language models and semi-supervised learning, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting illicit marketplace content is challenging due to limited labeled data, evolving language, and varied online platforms, necessitating advanced and adaptable methods.

Method: The method uses a hierarchical pipeline with ModernBERT for semantic representations fine-tuned on domain-specific data, incorporates engineered features, and a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM for classification.

Result: The model outperforms various baselines with an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388 on datasets including multi-source corpus, DUTA, and CoDA.

Conclusion: This framework, combining language models and ensemble learning, is effective in detecting varied illicit content with strong results, even under limited supervision, demonstrating its real-world applicability.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of a hybrid framework combining traditional multi-label ML models and LLMs for subject analysis and predicts subject terms of books using LCSH, addressing challenges like hallucinations and over-generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subject analysis is critical for libraries, yet traditional ML models struggle with unseen cases, and LLMs may over-generate or hallucinate. A hybrid approach could address these issues.

Method: The proposed hybrid framework integrates traditional embedding-based ML models with LLMs. ML models predict the optimal number of labels and post-edit outputs to ensure alignment with LCSH vocabulary.

Result: The hybrid approach improved control and alignment of LLM-generated subject terms with the LCSH vocabulary, leading to more accurate subject analysis.

Conclusion: Integrating ML models and LLMs offers an effective solution to enhance subject analysis, minimizing hallucination and improving control over predictions.

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

### [28] [Full Triple Matcher: Integrating all triple elements between heterogeneous Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22914)
*Victor Eiti Yamamoto,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper targets the integration of diverse Knowledge Graphs (KGs) via a new method focused on label and triple matching, addressing context matching, an underexplored area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to integrate diverse and complex KGs in real-world scenarios, where traditional methods fail due to varying factors like size and information density.

Method: Proposes label matching through techniques like fuzzy matching and vector similarity, alongside triple matching to identify mappings between comparable triples to improve entity-matching accuracy.

Result: The method showed competitive accuracy compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and improved performance in entity matching tests using a new benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective solution for KG integration, particularly in complex and diverse contexts, backed by robust evaluation results on varied datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

*Esmail Gumaan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines hallucination in large language models (LLMs) by defining it formally, analyzing its risk theoretically, and proposing strategies for detection, mitigation, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously address the challenge of hallucination in LLMs, a crucial issue affecting the reliability and application of these models.

Method: The authors introduce formal definitions, theoretical frameworks like PAC-Bayes and Rademacher complexity, survey detection and mitigation techniques, and propose a unified approach for addressing hallucination issues.

Result: Bounds for hallucination risk were derived, various detection and mitigation strategies were identified, and a unified workflow was proposed. Evaluation protocols were also outlined to improve and quantify hallucination management.

Conclusion: The study establishes a theoretical basis and provides practical strategies for managing hallucinations in LLMs, ensuring more reliable and factually accurate model outputs.

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

### [30] [Reading Between the Timelines: RAG for Answering Diachronic Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22917)
*Kwun Hang Lau,Ruiyuan Zhang,Weijie Shi,Xiaofang Zhou,Xiaojun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a system redesign for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to better handle time-sensitive queries. It enhances RAG's temporal tracking and relevance capabilities and demonstrates its efficacy using a new benchmark for diachronic question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems excel at providing static factual knowledge but fail at answering longitudinal queries requiring temporal tracking of entities or phenomena. The motivation is to address this gap and enable RAG to manage dynamic, time-sensitive information effectively.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework that integrates temporal logic into the RAG pipeline. It separates a query into subject and temporal window components, and uses a specialized retriever to optimize semantic and temporal relevance for retrieving a contiguous evidence set across the specified time frame.

Result: The framework achieves 13% to 27% improvement in answer accuracy compared to standard RAG systems on the newly created Analytical Diachronic Question Answering Benchmark (ADQAB).

Conclusion: This study successfully demonstrates the integration of temporal logic into RAG systems for enhanced handling of longitudinal queries. It validates that these systems can perform evolutionary analyses for complex real-world questions and provides public access to the dataset and code for further research.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are
publicly available at https://github.com/kwunhang/TA-RAG.

*Daniel Son,Sanjana Rathore,Andrew Rufail,Adrian Simon,Daniel Zhang,Soham Dave,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes whether differently sized Gemma-2 language models develop comparable internal representations using Sparse Autoencoder techniques, observing strong alignment in middle layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding universality in large language model features could enhance interpretability across varying model scales.

Method: Utilized Sparse Autoencoder dictionaries to align monosemantic features from two Gemma-2 models with different scales, evaluating feature spaces using SVCCA and RSA.

Result: Middle layers of both models exhibit the strongest feature overlap, while early and late layers are less similar. Extensions to multi-token subspaces show consistent semantic interactions.

Conclusion: Large language models, despite size differences, develop fundamentally similar features, supporting universality as key to cross-model interpretability.

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

### [32] [A novel language model for predicting serious adverse event results in clinical trials from their prospective registrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22919)
*Qixuan Hu,Xumou Zhang,Jinman Kim,Florence Bourgeois,Adam G. Dunn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes predictive models using advanced language techniques to foresee safety outcomes in clinical trials from registration details, aiming to enhance trial design and participant safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials face challenges like termination due to unexpected safety outcomes. Predicting such outcomes beforehand can improve trial planning and reduce participant risk.

Method: Two predictive models were built using information from trial registrations: (1) classifier for SAE rate comparison between trial arms and (2) regression model for SAE proportions. A transfer learning approach using ClinicalT5/BioBERT and a sliding window method for embedding long texts were implemented.

Result: The ClinicalT5-based model achieved an AUC of 77.6% for SAE arm prediction and RMSE of 18.6% for control arm SAE proportion. Sliding window technique proved beneficial, boosting performance in classifiers and regressors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the prospect for leveraging trial registration data to predict safety outcomes and improve clinical trial design, underutilizing structured summary results available in databases.

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

*Jindong Li,Yali Fu,Jiahong Liu,Linxiao Cao,Wei Ji,Menglin Yang,Irwin King,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines discrete tokenization with vector quantization (VQ) for large language models (LLMs), presenting a taxonomy of methods, challenges, and emerging research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of a comprehensive survey that systematically examines vector quantization techniques in the context of LLM-based systems, given the growing importance of transforming multimodal data into discrete representations.

Method: The authors categorize 8 representative VQ variants across classical and modern paradigms, analyze their principles, training dynamics, and integration into LLM pipelines, and discuss their impacts on various applications.

Result: The paper identifies key challenges like codebook collapse and unstable gradients while reviewing existing applications and highlighting the influence of quantization strategies on LLM performance in alignment, reasoning, and generation.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational reference by bridging the gap between traditional VQ and modern LLM applications, pointing to future directions like task-adaptive quantization and unified frameworks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

### [34] [Fast and Accurate Contextual Knowledge Extraction Using Cascading Language Model Chains and Candidate Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22921)
*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Language Model Chain (LMC) algorithm to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations in language model outputs by systematically refining responses with a cascade of models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the accuracy issues and high computational costs of language models, particularly their tendency to produce hallucinated information.

Method: The LMC algorithm utilizes a multi-stage cascade of language models where incorrect predictions are refined through progressively more accurate (but slower) models.

Result: Using LMC, the authors extracted patient dates of birth from medical documents, achieving higher accuracy and speed while reducing hallucinations compared to individual models.

Conclusion: The LMC algorithm offers a novel approach to improving language model performance in knowledge extraction, warranting further exploration.

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

### [35] [Predicting stock prices with ChatGPT-annotated Reddit sentiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22922)
*Mateusz Kmak,Kamil Chmurzyński,Kamil Matejuk,Paweł Kotzbach,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines if social media sentiment, particularly from Reddit's r/wallstreetbets, can predict stock movements, finding weak correlation with stock prices but stronger signals in other metrics like comment volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to understand how social media sentiment, as witnessed during events like the GameStop short squeeze, influences stock market movements.

Method: Three sentiment analysis methods are employed: two pre-existing text-based tools and a newly developed ChatGPT-annotated RoBERTa-based model fine-tuned for informal language and emojis in social media.

Result: Social media sentiment shows weak correlation with stock prices, while metrics like comment volume and Google search trends are better predictors of market movements.

Conclusion: Traditional sentiment analysis may not effectively capture the complexity of retail investor behavior in online discussions, and simpler metrics might offer better predictive value.

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

*Aman Gupta,Yingying Zhuang,Zhou Yu,Ziji Zhang,Anurag Beniwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates strategies for optimizing multilingual prompts in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems with LLMs, demonstrating improved classification task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address variability in LLM performance across different languages and tasks, particularly focusing on multilingual systems where knowledge bases are shared from high-resource to low-resource languages.

Method: Systematic evaluation of prompt translation strategies, comparing pre-translation and cross-lingual prompting approaches in multilingual RAG-enhanced systems.

Result: Optimized prompting strategy leads to better knowledge sharing across languages and enhances downstream classification task performance in multilingual systems.

Conclusion: Multilingual resource sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization are essential for improving LLM performance in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

*Brittney Exline,Melanie Duffin,Brittany Harbison,Chrissa da Gomez,David Joyner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how native and non-native English speakers experience peer feedback in online U.S. computing courses, using sentiment analysis and feedback ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of language background in shaping peer feedback experiences in online U.S.-based computing courses attended by international students.

Method: A Twitter-roBERTa-based model was used to analyze sentiment in peer reviews from 500 randomly selected students, examining feedback written by and to native and non-native English speakers.

Result: Native speakers rate feedback less favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less positive sentiment in return. Controlling for sex and age reveals more complex interactions.

Conclusion: Language background modestly yet complexly influences the sentiment and ratings in peer feedback within online education settings.

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

*Haoran Sun,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents, which organizes memory in a layered, semantically abstract way to improve memory retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory mechanisms for LLM Agents face limitations in structured organization and efficient retrieval, impacting their reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

Method: The H-MEM architecture organizes memory hierarchically by semantic abstraction, embedding positional indices for efficient layer-by-layer retrieval using index-based routing.

Result: Experiments on the LoCoMo dataset indicate that H-MEM outperforms five baseline methods across five task settings, highlighting its efficacy in long-term dialogue scenarios.

Conclusion: H-MEM enhances LLM Agents' memory storage, organization, and retrieval, leading to better reasoning and contextual understanding in long-term interactions.

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

*Nilesh,Atul Gupta,Avinash C Panday*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces a novel global context embedding for document-level relation extraction, tested successfully on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches focus on sentence-level entity mentions and fail to capture global document context for accurate relation extraction.

Method: Proposes an input embedding approach that represents entities as standalone segments across the document, leveraging global relationships and multi-sentence reasoning.

Result: Validated on DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL datasets, showing improved accuracy in predicting relationships in document-level settings.

Conclusion: Advances theoretical global context modeling and practical relationship detection, aiding NLP applications requiring deep interpretability.

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

TL;DR: This paper presents the Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark, a fine-grained evaluation framework focusing on assessing LLM capabilities in retrieval-augmented generation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack granularity, with limited focus on specific LLM contributions; the authors aim to fill this gap.

Method: The authors introduce a placeholder-based benchmarking approach that isolates LLM parametric knowledge from external knowledge for systematic multi-level assessment.

Result: Experiments reveal notable limitations in LLMs within RAG systems, such as reduced error resilience and decreased faithfulness to context.

Conclusion: The Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark provides a reproducible and nuanced framework for improving RAG systems, emphasizing the evaluation of LLM-specific roles.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in

*Xi Chen,Aske Plaat,Niki van Stein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies whether Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in large language models reflects actual reasoning processes via a causal investigation into internal computation using feature-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if the Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting mechanism used in large language models reflects genuine internal reasoning processes and how it impacts model performance.

Method: The study uses sparse autoencoders and activation patching to examine monosemantic features within Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B models handling GSM8K math problems. It analyzes the CoT effect through feature swapping, activation sparsity, interpretability scores, patch-curves, and random-feature patching comparisons.

Result: Findings indicate that CoT reasoning features significantly boost answer log-probabilities in the Pythia-2.8B model (but not the 70M model). Larger models exhibit heightened feature modularity and interpretability, along with increased confidence in correct answers (from 1.2 to 4.3). CoT information is distributed and not limited to the top-K features.

Conclusion: CoT prompting shapes more interpretable internal computations, especially in high-capacity language models, supporting CoT as a structured prompting mechanism.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents EH-Benchmark, a new tool to evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) used in ophthalmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance the accuracy of MLLMs in ophthalmic diagnosis by addressing hallucinations caused by limitations in ophthalmic knowledge, visual capabilities, and data scarcity.

Method: Develop a three-phase, agent-centric evaluation framework—Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, Result-Level Validation—and categorize hallucinations into two classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition.

Result: The framework reduces hallucinations, improving accuracy, interpretability, and reliability of MLLMs in ophthalmology tasks.

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark offers a reliable way to evaluate and address hallucinations in MLLMs, strengthening their clinical utility in ophthalmology diagnostics.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

*Shalini Jangra,Suparna De,Nishanth Sastry,Saeed Fadaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of privacy risks from self-disclosed personal information on social platforms by creating a synthetic dataset for PII detection using advanced language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to mitigate privacy risks and foster reproducible research into identifying personal information disclosures on social platforms, given the lack of open-source labeled datasets for such tasks.

Method: The authors devised a methodology to create synthetic data closely resembling original PII-revealing texts, employing large language models (LLMs) like Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and zephyr-7b-beta, guided by sequential instruction prompting.

Result: A synthetic PII-tagged dataset encompassing 19 categories was generated and evaluated for equivalence, unlinkability, and indistinguishability compared to the original data. These metrics confirm the dataset's utility.

Conclusion: This approach enables safer research into identifying PII disclosures, addressing privacy concerns while maintaining data utility. The dataset and code are shared publicly for fostering further research in this field.

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

*Zhangcheng Qiang,Kerry Taylor,Weiqing Wang,Jing Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the OAEI-LLM-T benchmark to address hallucinations in LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems by categorizing them and providing a resource for evaluation and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of hallucinations in large language models specifically within the context of ontology matching tasks.

Method: The authors developed the OAEI-LLM-T benchmark dataset, derived from seven TBox datasets in the OAEI. It categorizes hallucinations from ten different LLMs into two primary categories and six sub-categories.

Result: The dataset was used to construct a leaderboard for LLMs in OM tasks and for fine-tuning LLMs, demonstrating its practical application.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a structured way to evaluate and reduce hallucinations in ontology matching tasks, thereby addressing a critical issue in LLM deployment for such tasks.

Abstract: Hallucinations are often inevitable in downstream tasks using large language
models (LLMs). To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations
for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from seven TBox datasets in the
Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of
ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are
organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

### [45] [Enhancing RAG Efficiency with Adaptive Context Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22931)
*Shuyu Guo,Zhaochun Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACC-RAG is a framework enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) efficiency by dynamically adjusting context compression rates based on query complexity, leading to faster inference with maintained or improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG models face high inference costs due to the inclusion of lengthy retrieved contexts, and fixed-rate compression strategies fail to balance efficiency and accuracy by over-compressing or under-compressing input based on query complexity.

Method: ACC-RAG employs a hierarchical compressor, which creates multi-granular embeddings, and a context selector to dynamically adjust compression rates, ensuring minimal yet sufficient information retention similar to human skimming.

Result: When tested on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG showed faster inference—over 4 times faster in comparison with standard RAG—while maintaining or enhancing accuracy, surpassing fixed-rate methods.

Conclusion: ACC-RAG is a promising dynamic compression framework that improves the efficiency and accuracy of RAG systems, setting a new benchmark for context compression and retrieval-augmented generation models.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper reviews techniques to improve visual-language models by integrating them with symbolic reasoning systems for enhanced capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for interpretable, resource-efficient models that can incorporate new information and excel in logical reasoning limitations of current visual-language models.

Method: Systematic literature review categorizing approaches that leverage neural-symbolic integration using pre-trained Vision-Language Models coupled with external symbolic systems.

Result: Identification of promising techniques for visual-language improvement through neural-symbolic integration.

Conclusion: Neural-symbolic systems enhance reasoning, memory, and explanatory capabilities of visual-language models by integrating symbolic approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of leveraging organizational data while maintaining data confidentiality and overcoming the limitations of NLP tools for domain-specific applications like aviation operations and maintenance.

Method: The study involves breaking down the knowledge extraction process into four components (NER, Coreference Resolution, Entity Linking, and Relation Extraction), evaluating 16 NLP tools, and comparing them to LLMs using a public FAA dataset while ensuring operational compatibility in private environments.

Result: Significant performance limitations were observed among NLP tools and LLMs, specifically for zero-shot scenarios in aviation. The study highlights the challenges of trusted applications and identifies gaps in technical readiness levels.

Conclusion: The paper offers recommendations to improve trust in NLP and LLM tools for mission-critical industries and provides an open-source curated dataset to encourage further testing and evaluation.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.

TL;DR: This study evaluates the performance of five leading LLMs on analyzing 10-K filings from major tech companies using human annotations, lexical-semantic metrics, and behavior diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs in financial analysis, given their growing prominence in the domain.

Method: The authors evaluated GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and DeepSeek using domain-specific prompts, human annotations, automated metrics like ROUGE and Cosine Similarity, and prompt/model behavior diagnostics.

Result: GPT performed best in coherence and contextual relevance, followed by Claude and Perplexity, while Gemini and DeepSeek were less stable. Output consistency varied by company and over time, influenced by prompt design and input material.

Conclusion: The findings highlight differences in LLM performance for financial tasks, emphasizing the influence of prompts and input on output stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

*Jinkun Zhao,Yuanshuai Wang,Xingjian Zhang,Ruibo Chen,Xingchuang Liao,Junle Wang,Lei Huang,Kui Zhang,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoE-Ops, a framework combining large language models and ensemble methods to address challenges in the AIOps domain with notable accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single AIOps models lack versatility due to domain-specific constraints, while combining models potentially enhances performance across various tasks.

Method: The authors propose CoE-Ops, integrating task classification and retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms using large language models for high and low-level AIOps tasks.

Result: Experimental findings show CoE-Ops achieves a 72% accuracy boost for task routing, 8% improvement in problem resolution accuracy, and surpasses MoE models by 14% in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: CoE-Ops demonstrates significant advancement in handling diverse AIOps tasks by leveraging collaboration among models and innovative techniques, establishing itself as a more efficient alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper improves Question-Answering (QA) for technical documents by incorporating graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual large Language Models (VLMs) into a text-based QA system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems struggle with answering questions related to figures in technical documents, such as flowcharts, where answer extraction solely from text isn't effective.

Method: The paper proposes a pipeline incorporating graph representations of flowcharts obtained from VLMs into text embeddings for question answering in technical documents, validated in a telecom domain QA dataset.

Result: Graph representations fine-tuned with VLMs had lower edit distances compared to ground truth, improving retrieval accuracy. Additionally, the approach performs well without relying on VLMs during inference, reducing costs.

Conclusion: Using graph representations of flowcharts in QA systems enhances performance for answering figure-based questions in technical domains while offering cost control benefits during deployment.

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

*Rui Jiao,Yue Zhang,Jinku Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RELIANCE introduces a framework to improve reasoning factuality in LLMs, addressing intermediate inaccuracies within reasoning chains that can mislead users, especially in high-stakes domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce inaccurate reasoning steps despite arriving at correct answers, posing risks in domains like healthcare and legal analysis.

Method: RELIANCE combines a fact-checking classifier using augmented data, Group Relative Policy Optimization for balancing rewards, and activation-level interpretability to examine reasoning processes.

Result: Evaluations on ten models show concerning factual accuracy levels (e.g., Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 at ~82%), with RELIANCE improving robustness by up to 49.90% and enhancing performance across benchmarks like Math-500 and AIME-2024.

Conclusion: RELIANCE effectively improves reasoning factuality, provides structural insights for future model training, and strengthens accuracy without degrading benchmark performance.

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

*Paul Minchella,Loïc Verlingue,Stéphane Chrétien,Rémi Vaucher,Guillaume Metzler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SigBERT, a framework for temporal survival analysis that utilizes clinical text data through embeddings and rough path theory to improve patient risk prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing survival analysis methods struggle with handling the complexity of textual data, especially its sequential aspects, in electronic health records (EHR).

Method: The method combines timestamped medical report embeddings processed through rough path theory to extract key geometric features, fed into a LASSO-penalized Cox model for risk estimation.

Result: The model was trained on a real-world oncology dataset, achieving a C-index score of 0.75 with a standard deviation of 0.014 on an independent test cohort.

Conclusion: SigBERT can effectively integrate sequential medical data to improve patient-specific risk estimation, offering an advancement in survival analysis for narrative-style EHR data.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduced an expedited process using natural language processing (NLP) and adaptive sampling to validate claims-based algorithms in health research, reducing time and resources required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of validating code-based algorithms used for identifying health outcomes in claims databases, a process traditionally requiring extensive time and resources.

Method: The paper proposes a two-part process: (1) using NLP to assist human chart review and (2) applying a multi-wave adaptive sampling method to stop the validation study once sufficient precision is achieved.

Result: The NLP-assisted process reduced chart review time by 40%, and the adaptive sampling method prevented the review of 77% of charts without greatly compromising precision.

Conclusion: This streamlined approach enables more routine validation of algorithms, increasing the reliability of findings from health database studies.

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

Motivation: To challenge conventional views of arbitrariness as inherently tied to injustice and explore its role as a functional mechanism in human systems.

Method: Extending Ferdinand de Saussure's concept of 'l'arbitraire du signe,' introducing the 'Motivation -> Constatability -> Contestability' chain, utilizing Shannon's entropy model to define arbitrariness mathematically, and applying these concepts across language, law, social dynamics, and AI explainability.

Result: Arbitrariness is formalized as conditional entropy (A = H(L|M)), revealing its role as a foundational operator in both maintaining authority and fostering interpersonal care.

Conclusion: Arbitrariness is not inherently unjust but serves as a neutral and central mechanism in human systems and AI, offering insights into systemic functionality and accountability.

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

### [58] [C3: A Bilingual Benchmark for Spoken Dialogue Models Exploring Challenges in Complex Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22968)
*Chengqian Ma,Wei Tao,Yiwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark dataset and evaluation method for Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) to analyze their ability to handle challenges inherent to human voice interactions compared to text-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in research comprehensively evaluating the practical effectiveness of SDMs compared to text-based LLMs, especially under the complexities unique to spoken dialogue such as ambiguity and context-dependency.

Method: The authors developed a benchmark dataset with 1,079 instances in English and Chinese and an LLM-based evaluation method to assess the performance of SDMs.

Result: The dataset and evaluation method provide a structured way to explore the capabilities of SDMs in handling ambiguities, context-dependency, and conversational dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper contributes valuable tools to the study of SDMs, paving the way for a deeper understanding and effective assessment of their ability to emulate human conversations.

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

*Valeria de Paiva,Qiyue Gao,Hai Hu,Pavel Kovalev,Yikang Liu,Lawrence S. Moss,Zhiheng Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates LLMs' capability to solve natural language inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts, revealing both strengths and limitations, and provides a specialized Math NLI corpus for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the ability of contemporary large language models (LLMs) in processing and reasoning with mathematical language for natural language inference tasks.

Method: The authors created a Math NLI corpus with premises from mathematical texts, paired with hypotheses and corresponding labels provided by experts. They also generated hypotheses using LLMs for comparison. They evaluated the performance and consistency of diverse LLMs on this task.

Result: Positive findings include that aggregating outputs of LLMs via majority voting closely aligns with human-labeled data. However, LLMs still struggle with mathematical language and sometimes fail at basic inferences. Unlike earlier models, current LLMs are less prone to hypothesis-only errors.

Conclusion: While LLMs have improved in understanding mathematical texts for NLI tasks, significant challenges remain. The provided corpus can facilitate future research to enhance LLM performance in this specialized area.

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

*Diego Garat,Guillermo Moncecchi,Dina Wonsever*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores using In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP), achieving competitive results without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether ICL with LLMs can perform Frame Semantic Parsing tasks effectively, bypassing the need for traditional model fine-tuning.

Method: A method is introduced to automatically craft task-specific prompts for Frame Identification and Semantic Role Labeling by utilizing the FrameNet database.

Result: The approach yields F1 scores of 94.3% for Frame Identification and 77.4% for Frame Semantic Role Labeling on violent event-related frames.

Conclusion: ICL provides a promising and practical alternative to conventional fine-tuning methods for domain-specific FSP tasks.

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

### [61] [Context-aware Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23083)
*Ali Veisi,Delaram Fartoot,Hamidreza Amirzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARoPE, an enhancement to Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), which dynamically adjusts positional encodings based on context, achieving superior model efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE provides efficient and relative position encoding but is limited by static, context-insensitive frequency patterns, necessitating a method that captures context-aware relationships.

Method: CARoPE modifies RoPE by generating head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings and embedding context-dependent phase shifts into the rotary mechanism across attention heads.

Result: Experimentally, CARoPE outperformed RoPE and other baselines in reducing perplexity on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset, especially at longer context lengths, while also enabling faster training throughput.

Conclusion: CARoPE enhances Transformer positional encoding by combining RoPE's simplicity and efficiency with dynamic, context-sensitive adjustments, advancing the expressiveness and scalability of Transformer models.

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paper aims to address limitations of prior models that focus on local edits but fail to maintain global coherence during layout/content editing.

Method: Introduces two strategies: Reward-Refine (inference-time refinement) and RewardDPO (training-time optimization with reward-aligned layout pairs). A benchmark, SMARTEdit-Bench, is also introduced for evaluation.

Result: SMART-Editor outperforms baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with significant gains in structured settings and advantages on unstructured images. Results validated by automatic and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Reward-guided planning is effective in creating semantically consistent and visually aligned edits across diverse domains.

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

*Jeffrey Eben,Aitzaz Ahmad,Stephen Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a retrieval architecture to improve LLM-based natural language database interfaces, targeting scalability and effectiveness without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling natural language interfaces for enterprise-level data catalogs while addressing current challenges like domain-specific fine-tuning and underutilization of metadata.

Method: A component-based retrieval architecture indexes database schemas and metadata into semantic units, ensuring table-level and column-level information is efficiently retrieved.

Result: Experiments show high recall and accuracy with the approach outperforming baselines on large, diverse databases.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture bridges scalability gaps in text-to-SQL systems, enabling practical deployment across diverse environments without the need for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

*Xinwei Wu,Haojie Li,Hongyu Liu,Xinyu Ji,Ruohan Li,Yule Chen,Yigeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) handle ambiguous Chinese narrative texts, demonstrating their deficiencies through a benchmark dataset and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the trustworthiness of LLMs in handling ambiguous narrative texts, particularly focusing on their linguistic limitations in Chinese ambiguity.

Method: Developed a benchmark dataset with ambiguous sentences, categorized them systematically, and ran experiments to understand LLM behavior in disambiguation tasks.

Result: LLMs struggle to distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous texts, exhibit overconfidence in interpreting ambiguity, and overthink when processing multiple meanings.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have fundamental limitations in managing linguistic ambiguity, underscoring the need for methodologies that better handle uncertainty in text interpretation.

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub
repository: https://github.com/ictup/LLM-Chinese-Textual-Disambiguation.

*Ananya Sadana,Yash Kumar Lal,Jiawei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISO-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate the causal reasoning capability of multimodal models, showing their performance lags significantly behind humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of understanding causal relationships across modalities in multimodal models, especially in real-world situations.

Method: The authors developed ISO-Bench, a benchmark that pairs images of task steps with procedural text snippets, requiring models to determine the temporal order between visual and textual steps. They evaluated ten state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Result: The performance of tested models is underwhelming, achieving a maximum zero-shot F1 of 0.57 and chain-of-thought reasoning marginally improving to 0.62 F1. Humans perform substantially better with an F1 score of 0.98.

Conclusion: Multimodal models currently lack strong causal reasoning capabilities, and the authors provide specific recommendations to improve causal understanding in these models based on their analysis.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

### [66] [User Feedback in Human-LLM Dialogues: A Lens to Understand Users But Noisy as a Learning Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23158)
*Yuhan Liu,Michael J. Q. Zhang,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how implicit user feedback can be mined from language model-user interaction logs to improve model performance. It finds mixed results, with performance gains on simple tasks but limits on complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable language models to evolve through user interactions without needing direct and disruptive user feedback.

Method: Analyzing implicit user feedback from two datasets (WildChat and LMSYS) and studying its impact on improving model performance for various question types.

Result: Model performance improved for simple, short questions but showed limited improvement for complex, longer questions. Feedback utility was highly dependent on the quality of the user's initial prompt.

Conclusion: Implicit user feedback holds potential to refine LMs but has limitations, particularly for complex tasks and where initial prompts are weak.

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

### [67] [LENS: Learning Ensemble Confidence from Neural States for Multi-LLM Answer Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23167)
*Jizhou Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The authors propose LENS, a new confidence estimation approach, to better combine predictions of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), improving their ensemble performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ensemble methods for LLMs like voting or logits ensembling do not account for models' varying confidence and reliability in different contexts, necessitating a better solution.

Method: LENS involves training lightweight linear confidence predictors for each LLM, using their internal representations (hidden states and normalized probabilities) to estimate context-dependent confidence, without requiring model parameter modification.

Result: The LENS method substantially outperformed traditional ensemble techniques in multiple-choice and boolean question-answering tasks.

Conclusion: Internal representations can effectively serve as confidence signals, making LENS a superior method for ensemble learning, enhancing system robustness and performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEAK, a framework using modern LLMs to generate efficient Triton-based GPU kernels for AMD GPUs, achieving up to 63% correctness and 2.59X speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing complexity and diversity of AI and deep learning workloads necessitate the automation of low-level GPU kernel development to enhance performance and productivity.

Method: The proposed GEAK framework leverages inference-time compute scaling and a Reflexion-style reasoning loop to optimize Triton-based GPU kernel generation for AMD GPUs.

Result: GEAK outperformed baseline approaches, achieving up to a 63% correctness rate and a 2.59X execution speed improvement on evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Agentic code-generation frameworks like GEAK can accelerate the adoption of diversified hardware while democratizing high-performance kernel optimizations.

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

*Yunhao Liang,Ruixuan Ying,Takuya Taniguchi,Zhe Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for enhancing few-shot in-context learning (ICL) by leveraging both Positive and Negative examples during example selection, leading to better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current few-shot ICL techniques are highly sensitive to example selection, with existing methods focusing primarily on Positive examples and neglecting the potential utility of Negative examples.

Method: The proposed method first constructs Positive and Negative sample corpora using Zero-Shot-Cot. For each query, it selects the most similar examples from both corpora based on semantic similarity, then refines the Positive example selection by incorporating information from Negative examples.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms approaches using only Positive examples, demonstrating that the inclusion of Negative examples improves the selection process and overall ICL performance.

Conclusion: Leveraging Negative samples alongside Positive ones can significantly enhance ICL by refining the Positive sample selection process, proving the importance of both types of examples in optimizing contextual learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTMs innovate traditional topic models by employing interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders to reveal conceptual themes and enable controllable text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic models rely on bag-of-words representations, limiting their ability to articulate complex topics. Neural models also face constraints similar to word-list-based topic representations.

Method: Mechanistic Topic Models utilize sparse autoencoders to define interpretable features and introduce richer semantic spaces. They also employ a pairwise evaluation framework, 'topic judge,' leveraging LLMs.

Result: MTMs demonstrated superior or comparable performance in coherence metrics across five datasets and were preferred in pairwise evaluation. They also enabled effective controllable text generation.

Conclusion: MTMs can uncover richer semantic themes than traditional and neural models, while introducing controllable generation of text based on expressive topic descriptions.

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

TL;DR: The paper presents TAP-GPT, a framework using a tabular-specialized large language model for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis with structured biomarker data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease early and accurately is challenging due to the complexity of biomarkers involved, necessitating advanced methods.

Method: TAP-GPT adapts TableGPT2, finetuned with qLoRA and structured biomarker data in few-shot tabular prompts, for a binary classification task of AD diagnosis.

Result: TAP-GPT outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized tabular models in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using structured biomedical data.

Conclusion: The research introduces a novel use of LLMs for biomedical prediction using tabular data, setting a precedent for future LLM-driven frameworks in healthcare.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Motivation: To address gaps in explainability and reasoning for mental health-related chatbots using large language models.

Method: The authors define pragmatic phenomena (implicature, presupposition) for mental health, release the P-ReMe dataset, and formulate reasoning tasks. Benchmarks are set using various LLMs, and stigma around mental health is analyzed with StiPRompts.

Result: Mistral and Qwen performed well in reasoning tasks, while Claude-3.5-haiku showed higher responsibility in addressing stigma.

Conclusion: Pragmatic reasoning improves chatbot personalizations for mental health, and certain models excel in specific tasks.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates challenges in Bengali NLP, evaluates 10 LLMs on 8 datasets, and identifies areas for improvement, like tokenization efficiency and dataset quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underrepresentation of Bengali, an underrepresented language in NLP, and tackle challenges like the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Evaluated 10 open-source LLMs using 8 translated datasets, performed error analysis, and investigated tokenization's effect on accuracy.

Result: Found performance gaps in Bengali NLP compared to English, noted issues with tokenization, and identified robust models like DeepSeek.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of better datasets, tokenization strategies, and evaluation methodologies for advancing Bengali NLP and other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly
available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

*Zunhai Su,Qingyuan Li,Hao Zhang,YuLei Qian,Yuchen Xie,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper identifies and analyzes a subset of crucial 'Super Experts' (SEs) in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs), showing their importance for performance and robustness in various tasks, especially mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of in-depth understanding of the heterogeneous importance of experts within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models in LLMs and their impact on efficiency and performance.

Method: The authors analyze the activation patterns of experts in MoE LLMs, identify so-called 'Super Experts' characterized by rare yet extreme activations, and assess their significance through pruning and task-based performance evaluations.

Result: The study finds that SEs are critical to MoE LLMs' functionality, significantly impacting tasks like mathematical reasoning. Pruning SEs disrupts attention mechanisms and leads to performance degradation.

Conclusion: Super Experts are crucial for the operational robustness and task performance of MoE LLMs. Their unique role offers deeper insights into the architecture of these models for future optimizations.

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o-mini implicitly sanitize sensitive language during tasks such as paraphrasing and analyzes their moderation behavior and sensitivity classification capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether proprietary LLMs unintentionally moderate sensitive content without explicit instructions, given their tendencies towards politeness and formality.

Method: Empirical analysis of GPT-4o-mini’s behavior in paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluation of its zero-shot classification performance against traditional methods.

Result: Findings reveal that GPT-4o-mini moderates language towards less sensitivity categories, with significant reductions in derogatory and taboo expressions. It performs sensitivity classification tasks competitively without explicit training.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate an implicit ability to sanitize sensitive content and classify its sensitivity, highlighting the need for awareness of the unintended moderation capabilities in their applications.

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes MusT-RAG, a framework using Retrieval Augmented Generation to adapt general-purpose LLMs for music-focused question answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have strong performance across domains but lack effectiveness in music-related tasks due to insufficient music-specific knowledge in training data.

Method: The method introduces MusT-RAG, leveraging external knowledge retrieval through a music-specialized vector database (MusWikiDB), and integrates context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes.

Result: MusT-RAG outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods in adapting LLMs for music, achieving consistent improvements in in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: MusT-RAG successfully enhances LLMs' capabilities in the music domain, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialized retrieval and fine-tuning approaches with MusWikiDB.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong
zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeQoDO introduces an unsupervised method for automatically constructing task-oriented dialogue (TOD) ontologies using large language models’ SQL capabilities and dialogue theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of parametric knowledge in large language models, which hinders explainability and trustworthiness. It recognizes the benefits of external, ontology-structured databases in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) but acknowledges the challenges of manual or supervised ontology construction.

Method: The method involves TeQoDO, which autonomously constructs TOD ontologies without supervision. This leverages the SQL programming capabilities of large language models combined with dialogue theory provided via prompts.

Result: TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning methods and produces competitive ontologies for downstream dialogue state tracking tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of embedded dialogue theory. It also scales well for larger datasets, such as Wikipedia and ArXiv.

Conclusion: TeQoDO offers a scalable, unsupervised approach to ontology construction, potentially broadening the use of ontologies for enhancing explainability in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

*Yiyan Ji,Haoran Chen,Qiguang Chen,Chengyue Wu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MPCC, a benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' ability to plan under multimodal constraints, and finds significant limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address shortcomings in evaluating multimodal real-world planning capabilities and integrate constraints effectively in benchmarks.

Method: Develop a benchmark (MPCC) with real-world tasks like Flight, Calendar, and Meeting Planning, incorporating graded constraint complexity.

Result: Experiments show MLLMs struggle with multimodal constraints; closed-source models perform marginally better than open-source models, with low feasible planning rates.

Conclusion: Current models are inadequate for constraint-aware multimodal planning, necessitating advancements for practical applications.

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

*Ailiang Lin,Zhuoyun Li,Kotaro Funakoshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Causal2Vec, an approach to enhance embedding generation in decoder-only large language models (LLMs) through a lightweight prepended token method, achieving better performance while reducing computational load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in decoder-only LLMs for embedding tasks, such as the impact of removing causal attention masks and reliance on extra input text, which increase computational costs.

Method: Uses a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode input into a contextual token prepended to the LLM, combined with concatenating hidden states of contextual and EOS tokens for final embeddings.

Result: Causal2Vec achieved state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with significantly reduced sequence lengths (up to 85%) and inference times (up to 82%) compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Causal2Vec enhances decoder-only LLMs for text embeddings without altering their architecture, offering efficient and effective embedding generation.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

TL;DR: This paper explores using locally deployable, open-source large language models (LLMs) on CPU platforms as alternatives to proprietary, cloud-based AI chatbots in translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are concerns over data privacy, security, and equitable access with cloud-based AI chatbots, creating a need to explore feasible local alternatives for individual translators and small businesses.

Method: The study evaluates three open-source LLMs installed on CPU-based platforms, comparing them to commercial online AI chatbots, with a focus on functional performance rather than translation quality.

Result: Local deployment offers significant benefits such as enhanced data privacy, better control, and reduced reliance on cloud services, though it also comes with unique challenges.

Conclusion: Locally deployable free models can democratize AI technology, making it more accessible and scalable for individual translators and small businesses while preserving privacy and control over data.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework using multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization to achieve superior summarization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the shortcomings of existing multi-document summarization methods, which struggle with representing complex relationships among documents and dynamically reducing redundancy due to reliance on single-relational graphs and a predefined cluster number.

Method: The paper proposes constructing a multi-relational graph with semantic and discourse relations, using a structural entropy minimization algorithm to adaptively cluster sentences, and employing a position-aware compression mechanism for summarization.

Result: MRGSEM-Sum consistently outperforms prior unsupervised methods on four benchmark datasets and, in some cases, rivals supervised models and large language models. Human evaluations affirm the summaries' high consistency and coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully reduces information redundancy and models intricate relationships in multi-document summarization, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and human-level quality in generated summaries.

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic NLP and IR face challenges due to its complex morphology, diacritics, and coexistence of MSA with dialects. Despite its importance, Arabic remains underrepresented in NLP research.

Method: An improved DPR framework using a novel ARS scoring mechanism, combined with pre-trained Arabic models and architectural refinements to enhance passage retrieval and relevance accuracy.

Result: Significant improvement in retrieval performance and ranking accuracy for answering Arabic questions.

Conclusion: The framework presents advancements in Arabic passage retrieval tasks, leveraging novel mechanisms and language model integrations to address the unique challenges of Arabic NLP.

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics
and the coexistence of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various dialects.
Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces proactive critical thinking for AI, where models actively seek additional information to resolve user queries, presenting new benchmarks (GSM-MC and GSM-MCE) to evaluate this. Reinforcement learning (RL) significantly improves these capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems lack proactive critical thinking, merely rejecting flawed queries rather than resolving them by seeking additional information from users.

Method: The authors developed two benchmarks, GSM-MC and GSM-MCE, to test mathematical reasoning in models under conditions of missing or misleading information. They applied RL techniques to test model improvements in proactive critical thinking.

Result: The Qwen3-1.7B model's accuracy on the GSM-MC benchmark significantly improved from 0.15% to 73.98% after applying the enhanced RL algorithm.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential for improving collaborative problem-solving in AI systems by focusing on proactive critical thinking, enabling models to address user queries more effectively.

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to control model output based on user roles in enterprise settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As enterprises adopt LLMs, there's a need to control model behavior to reflect user-specific access privileges instead of uniform access.

Method: The authors propose three strategies: using a BERT-based classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned response generation. They constructed a dataset from instruction-tuning corpora and generated synthetic data for evaluation.

Result: The evaluation assesses model performance across organizational setups and tests robustness against prompt injection, role mismatches, and jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: LLMs can potentially address role-specific constraints through fine-tuning, enhancing their adaptability and security in enterprise applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

TL;DR: The authors propose a benchmark called Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB) to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the clinical domain for safety and effectiveness, revealing their moderate scores and pointing towards safer development of such models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address major concerns regarding the safety evaluation and effectiveness validation of large language models in the clinical setting to enhance their potential for decision support.

Method: They designed the CSEDB framework involving 30 criteria agreed upon by clinical experts and tested six LLMs using 2,069 Q&A items from 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world clinical challenges.

Result: The benchmark highlighted moderate performance scores (57.2% overall, with drops in high-risk scenarios) and identified domain-specific medical LLMs as more effective and safer compared to general-purpose models.

Conclusion: By enabling comparative analyses and identifying areas for risk mitigation, the benchmark fosters the safer and more effective implementation of LLMs in clinical environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential
to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in
healthcare environments.

Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of existing models that optimize retrieval and reasoning in isolation, rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and have inadequately designed reward functions for the medical domain.

Method: The Med-R$^3$ framework uses progressive reinforcement learning to develop reasoning capability first, then adapts retrieval to align with external knowledge, and finally jointly optimizes retrieval and reasoning coordination.

Result: Med-R$^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ outperforms GPT-4o-mini by 3.93%, and Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a 13.53% improvement.

Conclusion: Med-R$^3$ effectively combines retrieval and reasoning through joint optimization, demonstrating superior generalization and performance in medical scenarios compared to prior methods.

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

### [87] [T-Detect: Tail-Aware Statistical Normalization for Robust Detection of Adversarial Machine-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23577)
*Alva West,Luodan Zhang,Liuliu Zhang,Minjun Zhu,Yixuan Weng,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: T-Detect introduces a method based on Student's t-distribution for detecting adversarial machine-generated texts, outperforming traditional Gaussian-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need arises due to inadequacies in current zero-shot detectors, which struggle with heavy-tailed text statistical distributions found in adversarial content or non-native English texts.

Method: T-Detect employs a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from Student's t-distribution instead of Gaussian normalization, leveraging leptokurtosis in adversarial texts.

Result: The method improves detection AUROC by up to 3.9% on benchmarks like RAID and achieves state-of-the-art performance when integrated into a two-dimensional framework.

Conclusion: T-Detect offers a robust, theoretically-backed advancement in statistical detection of machine-generated adversarial text, improving accuracy and reliability under challenging conditions.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient adaptation of differential attention in Transformers, using low-rank adapters, and evaluates its effectiveness across a variety of NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the parameter-efficiency of LoRA with the performance benefits of differential attention mechanisms in Transformer models.

Method: DiffLoRA incorporates low-rank adapters into both positive and negative attention terms of the differential attention mechanism, providing an efficient adaptation suitable for fine-tuning.

Result: DiffLoRA underperforms compared to other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods on most tasks but achieves notable improvements in specific domains, such as a +11-point gain on HumanEval compared to LoRA.

Conclusion: While not universally optimal, DiffLoRA demonstrates potential in certain specialized NLP tasks, warranting further exploration and analysis, supported by post-finetuning attention-pattern studies.

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently been proposed to improve performance in
Transformer models by canceling out noise through a denoiser attention
mechanism. In this work, we introduce DiffLoRA, a parameter-efficient
adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

TL;DR: The paper tackles hate speech detection and text cleaning in Arabic social media content using deep learning models and transformers, achieving 92% F1 score and notable BLEU score results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing need to identify and mitigate hate speech in Arabic text on social media.

Method: Utilized deep learning models and transformers for hate speech detection; approached text cleaning as a machine translation task.

Result: Best model achieved macro F1 score of 92% for hate speech detection and BLEU score of 0.3 for text cleaning.

Conclusion: Proposed methods are highly effective for detecting hate speech and cleaning texts, showcasing significant advancements in Arabic language processing.

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Devin Wingfield,Amin Ghasemi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines how large language models can generate natural language explanations for logical rules derived from knowledge graphs to improve understanding and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding logical rules in knowledge graphs is complex due to their intricacies and unique labeling conventions, and there is a need for better interpretability of such rules for improving reasoning and error detection.

Method: Logical rules are extracted using the AMIE 3.5.1 algorithm from FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets. Various prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, variable entity types, and chain-of-thought reasoning, are tested using large language models. Human evaluations and automatic assessments are conducted on explanation quality.

Result: The study shows that large language models perform well in generating explanations with correctness and clarity, though challenges such as hallucinations still exist.

Conclusion: Large language models show promise in explaining logical rules from knowledge graphs, but further work is needed to address limitations and enhance their utility for reasoning and interpretation tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

### [91] [Cascaded Information Disclosure for Generalized Evaluation of Problem Solving Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23776)
*Yunxiang Yan,Tomohiro Sawada,Kartik Goyal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using cascaded question disclosure to evaluate LLMs' problem-solving capabilities more accurately compared to standard QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QA benchmarks for LLM evaluation are indirect and may not reflect the true problem-solving capability of models.

Method: The framework collects model responses across multiple stages where each stage discloses partial information about the question, aimed at eliciting generalized reasoning.

Result: The method produces better intermediate reasoning traces and narrows the performance gap observed in indirect QA evaluations across various datasets.

Conclusion: The cascaded question disclosure framework improves the accuracy of LLM evaluations, while revealing that traditional QA benchmarks overestimate performance disparities between models.

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for efficient urban-scale scene reconstruction with real-time rendering, overcoming appearance variation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient framework for reconstructing and rendering urban-scale scenes robustly and in real-time, handling challenges of appearance variations in multi-view captures.

Method: The approach involves scene partitioning for parallel training, visibility-based image selection, a controllable level-of-detail strategy, appearance transformation to handle inconsistencies, and enhancement modules like depth and scale regularizations.

Result: The method demonstrated the ability to reconstruct urban-scale scenes efficiently with higher quality and outperformed previous techniques in both rendering quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective, efficient, and robust for large-scale scene reconstruction and rendering, addressing previous limitations in handling appearance variations.

Abstract: We present a framework that enables fast reconstruction and real-time
rendering of urban-scale scenes while maintaining robustness against appearance
variations across multi-view captures. Our approach begins with scene
partitioning for parallel training, employing a visibility-based image
selection strategy to optimize training efficiency. A controllable
level-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a
user-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while
maintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module
mitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images
while enabling flexible adjustments. Additionally, we utilize enhancement
modules, such as depth regularization, scale regularization, and antialiasing,
to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method effectively reconstructs urban-scale scenes and outperforms previous
approaches in both efficiency and quality. The source code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current gaze scanpath prediction models, which fail to capture the variability inherent in human visual exploration.

Method: The paper introduces ScanDiff, which combines diffusion models and Vision Transformers, incorporating stochasticity to generate diverse scanpaths. Additionally, it integrates textual conditioning for task-specific scanpath generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ScanDiff outperforms existing methods in both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and accurate gaze scanpaths.

Conclusion: ScanDiff advances gaze prediction research by better modeling human visual behavior's complexity, offering a more adaptable and realistic approach. The source code is also publicly released.

Abstract: Predicting human gaze scanpaths is crucial for understanding visual
attention, with applications in human-computer interaction, autonomous systems,
and cognitive robotics. While deep learning models have advanced scanpath
prediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to
capture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present
ScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision
Transformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths. Our method explicitly
models scanpath variability by leveraging the stochastic nature of diffusion
models, producing a wide range of plausible gaze trajectories. Additionally, we
introduce textual conditioning to enable task-driven scanpath generation,
allowing the model to adapt to different visual search objectives. Experiments
on benchmark datasets show that ScanDiff surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both free-viewing and task-driven scenarios, producing more diverse and
accurate scanpaths. These results highlight its ability to better capture the
complexity of human visual behavior, pushing forward gaze prediction research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spike-based Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) framework with dynamic time-step adjustments to enhance efficiency for 3D rendering tasks, achieving significant reductions in inference steps (64%) and power consumption (61.55%) while maintaining rendering fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to address the computational and resource-intensive nature of NeRF-based models, which limit their viability in edge computing and resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: The authors propose Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step Adjustment (PATA), a dynamic time step training strategy tailored to spike-based Neural Networks, allowing automatic exploration of rendering quality and computational trade-offs.

Result: PATA demonstrated reduced inference time steps by 64% and running power by 61.55%, while maintaining high rendering fidelity across diverse datasets using the Instant-NGP architecture.

Conclusion: The spike-based NeRF framework with PATA shows promise for energy-efficient neural rendering and its compatibility with edge computing applications, addressing scalability and adaptation challenges in varying scenes.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models have achieved remarkable success
in 3D reconstruction and rendering tasks. However, during both training and
inference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from
multiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and
severely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge
computing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes
over discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their
energy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and
texture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training
separate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a
dynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step
Adjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between
rendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it
enables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the
additional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.
Anchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method
across diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve
rendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\% and running
power by 61.55\%.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of super-resolution (SR) techniques for improving classification accuracy in low-quality echocardiographic images, using deep learning models like SRGAN and SRResNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the problem of poor-quality echocardiographic imaging hampering automated cardiac diagnosis in resource-constrained settings.

Method: The authors utilize SRGAN and SRResNet to enhance low-quality images from the CAMUS dataset and evaluate these methods in two clinically relevant classification tasks.

Result: The SRResNet model notably improves classification performance in low-quality echocardiograms and is computationally efficient compared to SRGAN.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based SR models can recover diagnostic value in degraded echocardiographic images, providing a practical solution for AI-assisted healthcare in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Automated cardiac interpretation in resource-constrained settings (RCS) is
often hindered by poor-quality echocardiographic imaging, limiting the
effectiveness of downstream diagnostic models. While super-resolution (SR)
techniques have shown promise in enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans, their application to echocardiography-a widely
accessible but noise-prone modality-remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate the potential of deep learning-based SR to improve classification
accuracy on low-quality 2D echocardiograms. Using the publicly available CAMUS
dataset, we stratify samples by image quality and evaluate two clinically
relevant tasks of varying complexity: a relatively simple Two-Chamber vs.
Four-Chamber (2CH vs. 4CH) view classification and a more complex End-Diastole
vs. End-Systole (ED vs. ES) phase classification. We apply two widely used SR
models-Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and
Super-Resolution Residual Network (SRResNet), to enhance poor-quality images
and observe significant gains in performance metric-particularly with SRResNet,
which also offers computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that SR
can effectively recover diagnostic value in degraded echo scans, making it a
viable tool for AI-assisted care in RCS, achieving more with less.

*Santosh Patapati,Trisanth Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NovaDrive is a vision-language model for autonomous vehicles that integrates multiple sensor inputs and waypoints to improve navigation efficiency, safety, and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of quick decision-making in autonomous vehicle navigation by leveraging multi-modal, vision-language architectures for better safety, efficiency, and reduced computational needs.

Method: NovaDrive utilizes a single-branch vision-language model with a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to integrate diverse sensory inputs, coupled with a novel smoothness loss to eliminate the need for recurrent memory.

Result: NovaDrive achieved an 84% success rate (+4%), improved path efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduced collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) on prominent benchmarks like nuScenes and Waymo.

Conclusion: NovaDrive demonstrates improved safety, fuel efficiency, and real-time handling in autonomous navigation systems, paving the way for broader applications in embodied AI domains.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road
geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce
NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes
front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a
single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns
waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image
and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt
steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent
memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language
backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the
MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts
path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from
2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations
confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention
fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's
shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower
fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving
stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

### [99] [Reference-Guided Diffusion Inpainting For Multimodal Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23058)
*Alexandru Buburuzan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MObI and AnydoorMed, two synthetic data generation methods addressing multimodal inpainting for autonomous driving and medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical fields like autonomous driving and medical imaging require substantial multimodal data for testing, but generating real data is costly and complex.

Method: MObI enables multimodal inpainting for autonomous driving via a diffusion model, while AnydoorMed inpaints medical images with fine anomaly preservation.

Result: Both methods ensure realism and controllability, achieving multimodal coherence and structural integrity in their respective domains.

Conclusion: These innovations extend reference-guided inpainting techniques across modalities, enabling advanced synthetic data generation for critical applications.

Abstract: Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image
analysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic
data methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering
real-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability
to be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data
generation in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and
AnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal
Object Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and
controllable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated
simultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI
enables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a
specified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic
consistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods
that rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning
to ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed
extends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on
reference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a
diffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,
maintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically
blending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate
that foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be
readily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next
generation of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable
and multimodal counterfactual scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZ-Drive integrates geometric and semantic tasks in one model for steering and speed output. It outperformed benchmarks with 95% success on MD-NEX, halved collisions, and highlighted the value of modalities and fusion techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap of separate handling of geometric accuracy and semantic understanding in autonomous cars, with the aim of seamlessly integrating them for complex navigation.

Method: XYZ-Drive employs a vision-language model using inputs like a front-camera frame, overhead map, and waypoint. It leverages a goal-centered cross-attention layer and partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 model for decision-making.

Result: Achieved 95% success rate on MD-NEX benchmark, outperformed PhysNav-DG by 15%, reduced collision rates, and highlighted the significance of modality fusion and fine-tuning in driving tasks.

Conclusion: Token-level fusion across modalities alongside fine-tuning optimizations leads to accurate, efficient, and transparent decision-making in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to
navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We
present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera
frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs
steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets
waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both
action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially
fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and
0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and
halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only
a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality
(vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their
complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention
with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion
injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses
5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks
such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs
lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent
and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

*Dmitry Demidov,Zaigham Zaheer,Omkar Thawakar,Salman Khan,Fahad Shahbaz Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework, E-FineR, for fine-grained image classification that breaks away from traditional fixed vocabulary models and achieves state-of-the-art performance without predefined class labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models in fine-grained classification rely on fixed vocabularies and closed-set paradigms, limiting scalability in real-world scenarios where novel or emerging classes may appear.

Method: The authors propose E-FineR, a training-free method combining the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance interpretability and handle zero-shot and few-shot classification effectively.

Result: E-FineR achieved state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained image classification tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, without requiring pretraining or human intervention.

Conclusion: E-FineR enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable fine-grained classification systems with language-driven understanding, suitable for real-world applications and domains lacking expert annotations.

Abstract: Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between
visually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,
car models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.
Traditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set
classification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in
real-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has
demonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language
models (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for
predefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in
harnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily
on the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and
refinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,
Enriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art
results in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater
interpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and
new domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we
demonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot
classification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA
while being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our
vocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid
label prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable
and generalizable systems for real-world applications. Well-documented code is
available on https://github.com/demidovd98/e-finer.

*Sanghun Jung,Jingjing Zheng,Ke Zhang,Nan Qiao,Albert Y. C. Chen,Lu Xia,Chi Liu,Yuyin Sun,Xiao Zeng,Hsiang-Wei Huang,Byron Boots,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation using a combination of complementary concepts to achieve a new state-of-the-art solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in enhancing the performance of open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation, which faces challenges in effective proposal generation and accurate instance classification.

Method: The method involves a two-stage scheme: 1) Robust 3D proposal generation using tracking-based aggregation and iterative merging/removal, and 2) Enhanced classification using Alpha-CLIP with object masks and a standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score mechanism.

Result: The framework achieved state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS benchmarks across all AP and AR metrics, surpassing even a closed-vocabulary method.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of techniques demonstrates that complementary concepts, when carefully integrated, can successfully address challenges in open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation and outperform existing methods.

Abstract: Unlike closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation that is often trained
end-to-end, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) often leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to generate 3D instance proposals and classify
them. While various concepts have been proposed from existing research, we
observe that these individual concepts are not mutually exclusive but
complementary. In this paper, we propose a new state-of-the-art solution for
OV-3DIS by carefully designing a recipe to combine the concepts together and
refining them to address key challenges. Our solution follows the two-stage
scheme: 3D proposal generation and instance classification. We employ robust 3D
tracking-based proposal aggregation to generate 3D proposals and remove
overlapped or partial proposals by iterative merging/removal. For the
classification stage, we replace the standard CLIP model with Alpha-CLIP, which
incorporates object masks as an alpha channel to reduce background noise and
obtain object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce the
standardized maximum similarity (SMS) score to normalize text-to-proposal
similarity, effectively filtering out false positives and boosting precision.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200 and S3DIS
across all AP and AR metrics, even surpassing an end-to-end closed-vocabulary
method.

### [103] [X-NeMo: Expressive Neural Motion Reenactment via Disentangled Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23143)
*Xiaochen Zhao,Hongyi Xu,Guoxian Song,You Xie,Chenxu Zhang,Xiu Li,Linjie Luo,Jinli Suo,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces X-NeMo, a system for animating static portraits using motion from a reference video, addressing key issues like identity leakage and expression capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing portrait animation methods struggle with identity leakage and capturing subtle or extreme facial expressions, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The approach uses an end-to-end framework that learns a 1D identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor, combined with cross-attention during image generation, dual GAN supervision, and augmentations.

Result: X-NeMo outperformed state-of-the-art methods, producing animations with high expressiveness and strong identity preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates identity leakage and improves the quality of portrait animations, offering a valuable tool for research.

Abstract: We propose X-NeMo, a novel zero-shot diffusion-based portrait animation
pipeline that animates a static portrait using facial movements from a driving
video of a different individual. Our work first identifies the root causes of
the key issues in prior approaches, such as identity leakage and difficulty in
capturing subtle and extreme expressions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a fully end-to-end training framework that distills a 1D
identity-agnostic latent motion descriptor from driving image, effectively
controlling motion through cross-attention during image generation. Our
implicit motion descriptor captures expressive facial motion in fine detail,
learned end-to-end from a diverse video dataset without reliance on pretrained
motion detectors. We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion
latents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN
decoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving
motion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention
rather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission
of spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion
backbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly
expressive animations with superior identity resemblance. Our code and models
are available for research.

*Xu Cao,Takafumi Taketomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural inverse rendering method to recover geometry, reflectance, and lighting from multi-view images, without requiring light calibration or normal maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve geometry and lighting reconstruction for 3D scenes without reliance on light calibration or intermediate per-view cues.

Method: The method uses neural implicit fields with shadow-aware volume rendering, predicting signed distance and latent reflectance values for each point in the scene.

Result: The approach outperforms previous methods in accuracy and adaptability for shape and lighting estimation, handling complex geometries and reflectance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable and versatile solution for inverse rendering, addressing limitations of prior normal-guided methods.

Abstract: We propose a neural inverse rendering approach that jointly reconstructs
geometry, spatially varying reflectance, and lighting conditions from
multi-view images captured under varying directional lighting. Unlike prior
multi-view photometric stereo methods that require light calibration or
intermediate cues such as per-view normal maps, our method jointly optimizes
all scene parameters from raw images in a single stage. We represent both
geometry and reflectance as neural implicit fields and apply shadow-aware
volume rendering. A spatial network first predicts the signed distance and a
reflectance latent code for each scene point. A reflectance network then
estimates reflectance values conditioned on the latent code and angularly
encoded surface normal, view, and light directions. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art normal-guided approaches in shape and lighting
estimation accuracy, generalizes to view-unaligned multi-light images, and
handles objects with challenging geometry and reflectance.

TL;DR: A single-image rain streak removal method is proposed utilizing a Corner Loss for preserving object boundaries and an R-CBAM block for dynamic feature adjustment. Results show improved performance over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rain streak removal from images requires maintaining fine structural details and quality while addressing noise suppression challenges.

Method: The method introduces a Corner Loss to maintain boundaries and texture, and an R-CBAM Block to enhance spatial and channel feature focus, improving the restoration process.

Result: The method achieves improved PSNR scores on datasets: 33.29 dB for Rain100L and 26.16 dB for Rain100H, outperforming prior techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed technique provides an effective solution for rain streak removal, ensuring better structural preservation and visual quality compared to earlier methods.

Abstract: The problem of single-image rain streak removal goes beyond simple noise
suppression, requiring the simultaneous preservation of fine structural details
and overall visual quality. In this study, we propose a novel image restoration
network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a
Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture
information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual
Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and
decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and
channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions
heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the
Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on
Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a motion retrieval framework that integrates text, audio, video, and motion modalities using sequence-level contrastive learning. It demonstrates enhanced retrieval performance using augmented datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion retrieval techniques lack user-friendly interaction and fail to leverage sequential representations for optimal performance. The inclusion of audio for improved realism and convenience has been unexplored.

Method: The framework aligns four modalities (text, audio, video, motion) into a fine-grained unified embedding space using sequence-level contrastive learning. Synthetic audio recordings were added to augment text-motion datasets for evaluation.

Result: The method achieved performance improvements, such as a 10.16% increase in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% increase in R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating four modalities significantly enhances multi-modal motion retrieval, offering improved performance and potential advancements in motion acquisition.

Abstract: Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior
precision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion
generation. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a
unified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.
However, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode
and often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for
improved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a
framework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --
within a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first
time in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This
fine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning
approach, which captures critical details across modalities for better
alignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets
with synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion
retrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%
improvement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in
R@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our
results show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal
counterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for
advancing motion acquisition.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel dataset for flooded area segmentation in satellite imagery captured during the 2019 Midwestern USA floods, and evaluates models' performance on this dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the shortage of suitable datasets specifically designed for segmenting flooded areas in satellite imagery.

Method: The authors collected satellite images from Planet Explorer, ensuring 10 images per location across five U.S. states, with uniform image resolution and preprocessing. They evaluated state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models and conducted ablation studies on temporal characteristics.

Result: The models tested on the dataset demonstrated modest performance, indicating the difficulty of the task and the need for more advanced methodologies.

Conclusion: While the dataset serves as a valuable resource for flood segmentation tasks, the modest model results underline the importance of future research incorporating multimodal and temporal learning strategies.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in
satellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite
imagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.
To fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA
floods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs
PBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing
both flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the
five states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset
ensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating
semantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in
computer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted
an ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.
Overall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for
future multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be

### [109] [Adversarial-Guided Diffusion for Multimodal LLM Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23202)
*Chengwei Xia,Fan Ma,Ruijie Quan,Kun Zhan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method (AGD) to use diffusion models for creating adversarial image attacks aimed at deceiving multimodal LLMs without overtly distorting the original visual input, demonstrating superior performance and resilience to common defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of traditional adversarial attacks that primarily rely on embedding high-frequency perturbations directly into clean images and are often susceptible to filtering defenses.

Method: The authors propose Adversarial-Guided Diffusion (AGD), where targeted adversarial semantics are injected into the noise component during reverse diffusion in a diffusion model to generate adversarial images.

Result: AGD surpasses existing methods in terms of both the effectiveness of adversarial attacks and robustness against defenses like low-pass filtering.

Conclusion: AGD represents a significant advancement in adversarial attack methods, leveraging the properties of diffusion models to create attacks that are both effective and more resistant to standard defensive techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.

*Xiaoyu Ji,Ali Shakouri,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses food crystal agglomeration by combining supervised segmentation and classification models, improving accuracy in identification and size predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of agglomeration in food crystals is challenging due to transparency and limited perspectives in 2D images.

Method: The approach integrates a supervised baseline for pseudo-label generation and a classification model with pixel-wise segmentation, alongside a post-processing module for preserving crystal properties.

Result: The method enhances true positive classification accuracy and size distribution predictions for agglomerated instances compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in handling variability in annotation confidence levels and accurately detects agglomerated food crystals.

Abstract: Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization
which traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual
annotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult
due to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing
on a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first
propose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for
the coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification
model that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both
models are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in
classification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post
processing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves
true positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution
predictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in
confidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under
two confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated
instances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces YOLO-ROC, a lightweight and high-precision road damage detection model addressing multi-scale feature extraction and computational inefficiency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing road damage detection models struggle with detecting small-scale damages and are computationally demanding, limiting real-world application.

Method: The proposed YOLO-ROC uses a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module for better feature extraction and a hierarchical channel compression strategy to reduce computational load.

Result: YOLO-ROC outperforms YOLOv8n with a mAP50 of 67.6%, reduces parameters to 0.89M, achieves better small-target detection, and compresses model size to 2.0 MB.

Conclusion: YOLO-ROC is an efficient and accurate model suitable for real-time road damage detection, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and
maintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection
methods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the
inadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for
diverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for
small-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and
computational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for
efficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road
Orthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial
Pyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to
reduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional
spatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.
Concurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from
3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the
RDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of
67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the
small-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only
2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on
the RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.

Abstract: As augmented reality (AR) becomes increasingly integrated into everyday life,
ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of its virtual content is critical. Our
research addresses the risks of task-detrimental AR content, particularly that
which obstructs critical information or subtly manipulates user perception. We
developed two systems, ViDDAR and VIM-Sense, to detect such attacks using
vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal reasoning modules. Building on
this foundation, we propose three future directions: automated, perceptually
aligned quality assessment of virtual content; detection of multimodal attacks;
and adaptation of VLMs for efficient and user-centered deployment on AR
devices. Overall, our work aims to establish a scalable, human-aligned
framework for safeguarding AR experiences and seeks feedback on perceptual
modeling, multimodal AR content implementation, and lightweight model
adaptation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper redefines Semi-FSCIL to address real-world scenarios by handling unlabeled samples from both base and novel classes. It proposes an Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Semi-FSCIL methods only focus on novel classes in the unlabeled set, which limits their applicability to practical scenarios. Hence, there is a need for a broader framework that incorporates unlabeled data from both base and seen novel classes.

Method: The paper introduces a new framework called Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) and proposes the Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC utilizes abundant base samples to dynamically correct biased feature distributions for novel classes.

Result: The proposed method, ALDC, achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in handling more complex and practical scenarios.

Conclusion: Redefining Semi-FSCIL to GSemi-FSCIL and employing ALDC improves the handling of unlabeled samples from diverse sources, advancing practical applications of FSCIL frameworks.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) focuses on models learning new
concepts from limited data while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
Recently, many studies have started to leverage unlabeled samples to assist
models in learning from few-shot samples, giving rise to the field of
Semi-supervised Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (Semi-FSCIL). However,
these studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined
to novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective
and cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world
scenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by
incorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled
set. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge
for existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples
from base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an
Ambiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy. ALDC
dynamically uses abundant base samples to correct biased feature distributions
for few-shot novel classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that
our method outperforms existing works, setting new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing unstructured queries for diverse real-world documents in RAG systems is challenging and demands automation.

Method: RL-QR uses reinforcement learning and Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train retriever-specific query rewriters, handling both text-only and multi-modal databases.

Result: RL-QR improved NDCG@3 by 11% for multi-modal RAG and 9% for lexical retrievers but faced challenges with semantic and hybrid retrieval models.

Conclusion: RL-QR shows promise for scalable, annotation-free query optimization in RAG systems, with noted areas for improvement in certain retriever types.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query
formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse,
unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce
\textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query
rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends
applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing
scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization
(GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing
retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house
data demonstrate significant improvements, with
$\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3
for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for
lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid
retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to
training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to
revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable,
annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying
avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Result: The CN atlas could robustly identify 8 fiber bundles linked to 5 pairs of CNs, showing strong spatial correspondence with expert manual annotations across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CN atlas enhances automated and detailed mapping of cranial nerve pathways, aiding in visualization and analysis of their spatial relationships to adjacent anatomy, thus advancing the field of diffusion imaging.

Abstract: Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of
the human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides
valuable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between
individual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed
CN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN
pair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present
what we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion
tractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The
CN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by
multi-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable
clustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for
multiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual
experiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence
with expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP
dataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of
pituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8
fiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,
oculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear
nerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work
contributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient
and automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing
the analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through
visualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.

### [116] [A Deep Dive into Generic Object Tracking: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23251)
*Fereshteh Aghaee Meibodi,Shadi Alijani,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of three main categories of object tracking methods, focusing particularly on advancements in transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in object tracking caused by occlusions, distractors, and appearance changes while summarizing the evolution of various tracking paradigms.

Method: The paper categorizes and compares various trackers qualitatively and quantitatively, focusing on transformer-based methods and their innovations.

Result: It introduces novel categorizations, visual/tabular comparisons, and summarizes evaluation benchmarks for object tracking advancements.

Conclusion: The study underscores the superiority of transformer-based methods in spatio-temporal modeling while organizing existing trackers effectively for comparative analysis.

Abstract: Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer
vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of
occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two
decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers,
discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based
approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few
existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single
category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper
presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular
emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core
design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel
categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of
representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from
multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,
highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven
by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

### [117] [Towards Measuring and Modeling Geometric Structures in Time Series Forecasting via Image Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23253)
*Mingyang Yu,Xiahui Guo,Peng chen,Zhenkai Li,Yang Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TGSI, a metric evaluating geometric structures in time series by transforming them into images, and SATL, a multi-component loss enhancing structure modeling during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like MSE fail to capture the geometric structure of time series, which is crucial to understand their temporal dynamics.

Method: The paper proposes the TGSI metric to evaluate geometric structures by image transformation and presents SATL, a loss function combining first-order difference loss, frequency domain loss, and perceptual feature loss.

Result: Experiments show that SATL improves on both MSE and TGSI metrics across multiple datasets without increasing computational complexity during inference.

Conclusion: The proposed TGSI and SATL effectively enhance time series modeling, addressing limitations of traditional point-wise evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Time Series forecasting is critical in diverse domains such as weather
forecasting, financial investment, and traffic management. While traditional
numerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise
accuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,
which is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we
propose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation
metric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent
two-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image
transformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly
integrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal
Loss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series
modality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.
SATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures
structural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a
frequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast
Fourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that
measures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal
features with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal
feature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior
performance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline
methods, without additional computational cost during inference.

### [118] [Learning Semantic-Aware Threshold for Multi-Label Image Recognition with Partial Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23263)
*Haoxian Ruan,Zhihua Xu,Zhijing Yang,Guang Ma,Jieming Xie,Changxiang Fan,Tianshui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm for multi-label image recognition with partial labels, addressing issues in pseudo-label generation by dynamically learning category-specific thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional methods in multi-label image recognition with partial labels, where inaccurate pseudo-labels stemming from fixed thresholds hinder performance.

Method: The Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm dynamically calculates and updates score distributions and thresholds for each category during the learning process, paired with a differential ranking loss to improve discrimination between positive and negative samples.

Result: Experiments on large-scale datasets like Microsoft COCO and VG-200 show that SATL substantially improves performance, particularly in cases with limited labels.

Conclusion: The proposed SATL algorithm effectively refines pseudo-labeling by learning adaptive thresholds, enhancing the accuracy and performance of multi-label image recognition models, especially under partial labeling conditions.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL) is designed to
train models using a mix of known and unknown labels. Traditional methods rely
on semantic or feature correlations to create pseudo-labels for unidentified
labels using pre-set thresholds. This approach often overlooks the varying
score distributions across categories, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
pseudo-labels, thereby affecting performance. In our study, we introduce the
Semantic-Aware Threshold Learning (SATL) algorithm. This innovative approach
calculates the score distribution for both positive and negative samples within
each category and determines category-specific thresholds based on these
distributions. These distributions and thresholds are dynamically updated
throughout the learning process. Additionally, we implement a differential
ranking loss to establish a significant gap between the score distributions of
positive and negative samples, enhancing the discrimination of the thresholds.
Comprehensive experiments and analysis on large-scale multi-label datasets,
such as Microsoft COCO and VG-200, demonstrate that our method significantly
improves performance in scenarios with limited labels.

### [119] [PixNerd: Pixel Neural Field Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23268)
*Shuai Wang,Ziteng Gao,Chenhui Zhu,Weilin Huang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors introduce PixelNeural Field Diffusion (PixNerd), a single-stage end-to-end model that achieves state-of-the-art image generation results by removing the reliance on traditional VAE and cascade pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing reliance on pre-trained VAE in diffusion transformers introduces errors and decoding artifacts, while alternatives returning to pixel space increase complexity. The authors aim to solve these issues with a simpler yet efficient solution.

Method: The authors propose modeling patch-wise decoding via a neural field representation. The proposed PixelNeural Field Diffusion (PixNerd) framework operates end-to-end in pixel space and eliminates the need for two-stage pipelines or latent VAEs.

Result: PixNerd achieves outstanding performance in image generation with FID scores of 2.15 on ImageNet (256x256) and 2.84 on ImageNet (512x512). It also performs well in text-to-image applications with a score of 0.73 on GenEval and 80.9 on DPG.

Conclusion: PixNerd offers a simplified and efficient approach to image generation, achieving competitive performance without relying on complex multi-stage architectures or VAEs.

Abstract: The current success of diffusion transformers heavily depends on the
compressed latent space shaped by the pre-trained variational autoencoder(VAE).
However, this two-stage training paradigm inevitably introduces accumulated
errors and decoding artifacts. To address the aforementioned problems,
researchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines
and increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to
model the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,
single-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field
diffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in
PixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\times256$ and 2.84 FID
on ImageNet $512\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also
extend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications. Our PixNerd-XXL/16
achieved a competitive 0.73 overall score on the GenEval benchmark and 80.9
overall score on the DPG benchmark.

### [120] [Towards Affordable Tumor Segmentation and Visualization for 3D Breast MRI Using SAM2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23272)
*Solha Kang,Eugene Kim,Joris Vankerschaver,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for low-cost, minimally supervised 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI, achieving strong performance using minimal inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast MRI is essential for tumor evaluation, but manual interpretation is labor-intensive and subjective, and AI-powered tools are not widely available in resource-constrained settings due to high costs and infrastructure needs.

Method: SAM2 was used to perform tumor segmentation in breast MRIs using a single bounding box annotation. Predictions were propagated through 3D volumes using top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, and center-outward slice-wise tracking strategies. Performance was evaluated across a large patient cohort.

Result: Center-outward tracking yielded the most consistent and accurate segmentations. SAM2 showed strong segmentation performance despite being a zero-shot model not trained on volumetric medical data.

Conclusion: General-purpose models like SAM2 can enable accessible and affordable 3D medical image analysis in low-resource settings, supporting minimal supervision requirements.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution volumetric imaging critical for tumor
assessment and treatment planning, yet manual interpretation of 3D scans
remains labor-intensive and subjective. While AI-powered tools hold promise for
accelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products
remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,
proprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate
whether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,
minimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box
annotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D
volume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,
bottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large
cohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most
consistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not
trained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation
performance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation
performance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure
modes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2
can support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an
accessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.

### [121] [iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23277)
*Gyeongjin Kang,Seungtae Nam,Xiangyu Sun,Sameh Khamis,Abdelrahman Mohamed,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes iLRM, a scalable and efficient iterative model for 3D reconstruction using Gaussian representations, which surpasses existing methods in quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feed-forward 3D modeling methods face scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational costs associated with full attention mechanisms in multi-view image processing.

Method: The authors introduce iLRM, which uses an iterative refinement framework based on three principles: decoupling scene representation, decomposing multi-view attention into a two-stage approach, and incorporating high-resolution information at every layer.

Result: iLRM demonstrates superior performance in both reconstruction quality and speed on datasets like RE10K and DL3DV. It effectively handles scalability by leveraging a larger number of input views under comparable computational costs.

Conclusion: iLRM offers an efficient and scalable solution for feed-forward 3D reconstruction, setting a new benchmark in the field by achieving higher quality and faster performance.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and
high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D
representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant
attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous
applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on
transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they
rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting
in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution
increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we
introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D
Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by
three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view
images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional
multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce
computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every
layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely
used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms
existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM
exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction
quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger
number of input views.

*Jinshan Zhen,Yuanyue Ge,Tianxiao Zhu,Hui Zhao,Ya Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision-based pipeline for non-destructive strawberry mass estimation using RGB-D sensing, deep learning, and occlusion recovery techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address challenges in accurate mass estimation of strawberries under field conditions caused by occlusions and pose variations.

Method: The method involved YOLOv8-Seg for strawberry instance segmentation, CycleGAN for occluded region recovery, tilt-angle correction, and a polynomial regression model for mapping geometric features to mass.

Result: The approach achieved mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated strawberries and 10.47% for occluded ones. CycleGAN demonstrated superior performance in occlusion recovery compared to the LaMa model.

Conclusion: This method provides a robust solution for improving automated harvesting and yield monitoring in scenarios with complex occlusions, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Accurate mass estimation of table-top grown strawberries under field
conditions remains challenging due to frequent occlusions and pose variations.
This study proposes a vision-based pipeline integrating RGB-D sensing and deep
learning to enable non-destructive, real-time and online mass estimation. The
method employed YOLOv8-Seg for instance segmentation, Cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) for occluded region completion, and
tilt-angle correction to refine frontal projection area calculations. A
polynomial regression model then mapped the geometric features to mass.
Experiments demonstrated mean mass estimation errors of 8.11% for isolated
strawberries and 10.47% for occluded cases. CycleGAN outperformed large mask
inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area
ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU)
scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9-1] range). This approach addresses critical
limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated
harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns.

### [123] [UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278)
*Hao Tang,Chenwei Xie,Xiaoyi Bao,Tingyu Weng,Pandeng Li,Yun Zheng,Liwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLIP enhances CLIP to support reconstruction, generation, and editing tasks, outperforming previous unified models in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based models for unified tasks often compromise comprehension performance during reconstruction and generation, creating the need for a consistent and effective approach.

Method: The authors introduced a two-stage training scheme and self-distillation strategy for integrating reconstruction into CLIP. Additionally, a dual-condition architecture links MLLM and diffusion transformer using learnable queries and multimodal hidden states.

Result: UniLIP achieved high benchmark scores in text-to-image generation (0.87 GenEval, 0.53 WISE) and image editing (3.62 ImgEdit Benchmark), surpassing state-of-the-art models like BAGEL and UniWorld-V1.

Conclusion: UniLIP expands CLIP's functionality by seamlessly integrating generation and editing capabilities while maintaining comprehension, making it competitive across various tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction,
generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its
exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods
often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support
reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or
degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a
two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively
integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain
original comprehension performance while achieving effective image
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to
connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and
the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not
only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in
generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information
in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,
UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark
respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image
editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,
surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP
effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP
features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but
also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

### [124] [Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23284)
*Dohwan Ko,Ji Soo Lee,Minhyuk Choi,Zihang Meng,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel retrieval framework (BLiM) and a training-free score calibration module (CPN) to address candidate prior bias in text-video retrieval tasks, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve text-video retrieval performance by addressing drawbacks of candidate bias caused by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

Method: Introduced Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM) and Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN) to mitigate candidate prior bias and emphasize query-candidate relevance.

Result: The proposed methods improve retrieval accuracy, achieving a 6.4 R@1 improvement across four benchmarks, and are more broadly applicable to other multi-modal tasks.

Conclusion: BLiM and CPN demonstrate effectiveness in alleviating candidate prior bias, improving multi-modal retrieval accuracy, and advancing visual understanding in multi-modal tasks.

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate
given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work
leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,
especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that
the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,
introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher
priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel
retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),
which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to
generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.
Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet
effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate
prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,
our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4
R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing
query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal
tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances
visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors. Code is available

*Dongming Wu,Yanping Fu,Saike Huang,Yingfei Liu,Fan Jia,Nian Liu,Feng Dai,Tiancai Wang,Rao Muhammad Anwer,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Jianbing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGNet, a large-scale grasping affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like instructions and diverse data, and proposes AffordanceNet, a comprehensive framework leveraging this data for robotic grasping tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic grasping systems require robust object affordance perception in complex, open-world scenarios instructed by humans. Existing methods lack adequate reasoning-based, large-scale affordance prediction data, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The authors developed RAGNet, a dataset with 273k images spanning 180 categories and 26k reasoning instructions, combined with diverse data domains. They also designed AffordanceNet, a framework incorporating a VLM pre-trained on this data and a grasping network conditioned on affordance maps.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior open-world generalization in affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: RAGNet and AffordanceNet significantly enhance open-world robotic grasping by supplying large-scale reasoning-driven affordance data and an effective grasping framework, offering promising applications in diverse scenarios.

Abstract: General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance
perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions.
However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based
large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about
open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale
grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like
instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k
reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as
wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully
annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions
is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing
functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive
affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a
VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that
conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on
affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that
our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability. Our data and code
is available at https://github.com/wudongming97/AffordanceNet.

*Inbum Heo,Taewook Hwang,Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Layout Error Detection (LED), a benchmark for assessing structural robustness in document layout predictions, along with a new synthetic dataset, LED-Dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics like IoU and mAP fail to capture structural errors in document layout analysis, prompting the need for better evaluation tools.

Method: The proposed benchmark LED defines eight error types and introduces three tasks to assess layout predictions. A synthetic dataset, LED-Dataset, with realistic errors is developed for experimentation.

Result: Experiments show LED highlights structural understanding strengths and weaknesses in models, revealing biases and trade-offs absent in traditional metrics.

Conclusion: LED and LED-Dataset provide a more nuanced understanding of layout prediction performance, facilitating better analysis of model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models
and Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,
despite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural
errors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional
evaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,
are insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
the structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight
standardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error
existence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type
classification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset
generated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical
distributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs
reveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding
capabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible
through traditional metrics.

*Hanshen Zhu,Zhen Zhu,Kaile Zhang,Yiming Gong,Yuliang Liu,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The authors propose FreeFine, a novel decoupled pipeline for geometric image editing, emphasizing object transformation, inpainting, and refinement, which outperforms previous methods on a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome difficulties faced by previous diffusion-based methods in handling large or complex geometric transformations in image editing while preserving scene coherence.

Method: The authors introduce a decoupled, three-step pipeline for geometric image editing: object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement, all using the FreeFine diffusion approach without additional training.

Result: FreeFine achieves superior image fidelity and edit precision compared to state-of-the-art methods, validated on the new GeoBench benchmark designed for 2D and 3D editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method, FreeFine, effectively handles challenging geometric transformations in image editing and sets a new performance standard on the GeoBench benchmark.

Abstract: We tackle the task of geometric image editing, where an object within an
image is repositioned, reoriented, or reshaped while preserving overall scene
coherence. Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all
relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations
become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled
pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and
target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using
a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new
GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit
precision, especially under demanding transformations. Code and benchmark are
available at: https://github.com/CIawevy/FreeFine

### [128] [ST-SAM: SAM-Driven Self-Training Framework for Semi-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23307)
*Xihang Hu,Fuming Sun,Jiazhe Liu,Feilong Xu,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ST-SAM, a simplified and effective SSCOD framework that achieves superior performance with only 1% labeled data by using self-training and hybrid prompts with a single model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSCOD aims to reduce the need for expensive pixel-level annotations. Existing methods face issues like prediction bias, error propagation, and high computational costs, creating the need for a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: The authors propose ST-SAM, which uses self-training with high-confidence pseudo-labels and hybrid prompts combined with domain-specific knowledge. It employs a single-model architecture to avoid prediction bias and enhance scalability while leveraging Segment Anything Model for specialized tasks.

Result: ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on COD benchmark datasets, surpassing existing SSCOD methods and matching the performance of fully supervised ones, all with only 1% labeled data.

Conclusion: ST-SAM sets a new benchmark for SSCOD with its efficient, single-network design, providing scalable, accurate results while significantly reducing annotation requirements.

Abstract: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance
on costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and
abundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on
Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error
propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures
incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise
framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,
ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands
high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby
fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by
transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific
knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential
for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.
Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing
SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM
requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or
loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient
SSCOD. Codes will be available at https://github.com/hu-xh/ST-SAM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PriorFusion, a framework combining semantic, geometric, and generative priors to enhance road element perception in autonomous driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need accurate road perception in complex environments without HD maps, but existing methods struggle with irregular predictions due to not leveraging road structure priors.

Method: It proposes a framework using an instance-aware attention mechanism with shape-prior features, a shape template space for clustering-based anchor point priors, and a diffusion model for better predictions.

Result: Experiments on large datasets show improved perception accuracy, especially under challenging conditions, with more precise and coherent road element predictions.

Conclusion: PriorFusion effectively combines structured priors to address challenges in road perception, offering an accurate and reliable solution for autonomous driving.

Abstract: With the growing interest in autonomous driving, there is an increasing
demand for accurate and reliable road perception technologies. In complex
environments without high-definition map support, autonomous vehicles must
independently interpret their surroundings to ensure safe and robust
decision-making. However, these scenarios pose significant challenges due to
the large number, complex geometries, and frequent occlusions of road elements.
A key limitation of existing approaches lies in their insufficient exploitation
of the structured priors inherently present in road elements, resulting in
irregular, inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a
unified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and
generative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an
instance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then
construct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional
representations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points
as reference priors. We design a diffusion-based framework that leverages these
prior anchors to generate accurate and complete predictions. Experiments on
large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly improves perception accuracy, particularly under challenging
conditions. Visualization results further confirm that our approach produces
more accurate, regular, and coherent predictions of road elements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of linear merging of models in continual learning, showing it preserves shared knowledge but degrades task-specific knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of retaining shared knowledge while minimizing the degradation of task-specific knowledge in continual learning models.

Method: Conducted computer vision experiments with controlled visual cues, comparing merging models trained incrementally versus those trained in parallel.

Result: Linear merging preserves shared knowledge and enhances it, but task-specific knowledge degrades quickly. Incremental training performs better than parallel training models for merging.

Conclusion: Linear merging can be a viable approach for transferring shared knowledge, especially when combined with incremental training processes for continual learning tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the linear merging of models in the context of
continual learning (CL). Using controlled visual cues in computer vision
experiments, we demonstrate that merging largely preserves or enhances shared
knowledge, while unshared task-specific knowledge rapidly degrades. We further
find that merging models from an incremental training process consistently
outperforms merging models trained in parallel.

### [131] [The Cow of Rembrandt - Analyzing Artistic Prompt Interpretation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23313)
*Alfio Ferrara,Sergio Picascia,Elisabetta Rocchetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how text-to-image diffusion models internally represent concepts like content and style in generating artworks, using cross-attention heatmaps for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how concepts of content and style are encoded in text-to-image diffusion models, especially since these models lack explicit supervision to distinguish between them.

Method: The authors use cross-attention heatmaps to trace pixel attribution to prompt tokens, separating regions influenced by content tokens versus style tokens.

Result: The study reveals that diffusion models show varied degrees of content-style separation, with content tokens influencing object-related areas and style tokens affecting texture/background regions.

Conclusion: Diffusion models exhibit an emergent understanding of the distinction between content and style in artistic prompts, offering insights into their internal representation of complex concepts.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including
popular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models
internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains
unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are
orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this
distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based
text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when
generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels
in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image
regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of
content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style
requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related
regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an
emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights
contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally
represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the
code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention
maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates seven efficient deep learning architectures for real-time, resource-constrained image classification, focusing on hyperparameter optimization and achieving both high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time image classification in embedded systems and edge devices often requires lightweight yet accurate models, which are challenging to construct. This study aims to improve model performance by understanding the role of hyperparameter adjustments.

Method: The authors trained seven deep learning models on the ImageNet-1K dataset with consistent settings, systematically studying hyperparameters like learning rates, batch sizes, input resolutions, and others. Evaluation criteria include accuracy, inference time, parameter count, and frames-per-second on GPU-accelerated edge simulations.

Result: The study found that specific practices, like using cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch sizes, significantly improve both accuracy and convergence speed while minimizing costs. Among the models tested, RepVGG-A2 achieved over 80% Top-1 accuracy while maintaining efficient inference performance.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable insights into the design of resource-efficient deep learning models, balancing accuracy, latency, and deployment cost with guidance specifically tailored for real-time image classification tasks.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for
real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as
embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of
hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven
efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT
v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are
trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an
emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is
undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including
learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation,
regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for
real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter
count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge
deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and
adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,
while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%
Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling
balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results
give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning
models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastDriveVLA is a framework improving Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving by proposing efficient visual token pruning using a method called ReconPruner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiencies of current visual token pruning methods in VLA models, especially for autonomous driving, and the need to prioritize foreground information for better decision-making.

Method: FastDriveVLA employs a plug-and-play component (ReconPruner), based on MAE-style pixel reconstruction and an adversarial foreground-background strategy, to optimize VLA model visual encoders. It uses the novel nuScenes-FG dataset during training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark under various pruning conditions.

Conclusion: FastDriveVLA effectively addresses computational inefficiencies in VLA models for autonomous driving by focusing on foreground token retention, making it adaptable and high-performing.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential
in complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their
increasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long
visual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current
visual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either
visual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor
performance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers
concentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that
retaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for
effective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel
reconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for
autonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner
called ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style
pixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction
strategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.
Once trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models
with the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also
introduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K
image-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes closed-loop planning benchmark across
different pruning ratios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FASTopoWM, a novel framework for lane segment topology reasoning, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving lane segment topology reasoning for autonomous driving systems by addressing issues like pose estimation failures and insufficient temporal propagation.

Method: FASTopoWM combines fast-slow reasoning systems with latent world models to enhance representation propagation and handle unreliable pose estimation.

Result: FASTopoWM achieves superior performance on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark, improving lane detection (37.4% mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% OLS) compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances temporal perception and robustness in lane topology reasoning, making it suitable for end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)
road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in
planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology
reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal
information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,
stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by
incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it
remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose
estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology
reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of
pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision
of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual
reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce
latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate
the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This
design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the
slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate
that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment
detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%
on OLS).

*Yingkai Wang,Yaoyao Zhu,Xiuding Cai,Yuhao Xiao,Haotian Wu,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel domain generalization framework to improve robustness in medical image segmentation, addressing domain shifts caused by varying imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is crucial but suffers from performance degradation when applied to new clinical domains due to variations in imaging conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols.

Method: The framework introduces implicit feature perturbations guided by domain statistics using a semantic direction selector and semantic intensity sampler. An adaptive consistency constraint is also employed to ensure that feature adjustments do not degrade segmentation performance.

Result: The proposed framework achieves superior segmentation performance across diverse clinical domains, outperforming existing domain generalization methods in experiments on two multi-center benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the generalizability and robustness of medical image segmentation models, making them better suited for practical deployment in varying clinical domains.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but
domain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to
unseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging
conditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical
deployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images
typically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with
domain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique
characteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.
  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework
tailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to
domain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided
by domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction
selector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate
domain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.
Furthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively
applied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation
performance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the
original predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the
reliability of the segmentation.
  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,
achieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse
clinical domains.

*Qiang Lu,Waikit Xiu,Xiying Li,Shenyu Hu,Shengbo Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in traffic sign recognition for autonomous vehicles by proposing a new two-stage method utilizing open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. It improves detection and classification performance, particularly for rare and small-scale signs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve traffic sign recognition, which is crucial for autonomous driving safety, and to tackle issues like long-tail dataset distributions and difficulties in detecting small-scale traffic signs.

Method: A two-stage framework includes the NanoVerse YOLO model for detection using RepVL-PAN and SPD-Conv for small, multi-scale target features, and the TSR-MCL model for classification leveraging multimodal contrastive learning using a Vision Transformer and BERT.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TT100K dataset with 78.4% mAP in long-tail detection, 91.8% accuracy, and 88.9% recall, outperforming mainstream methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enhances traffic sign recognition by addressing class imbalance and small-scale detection issues, showcasing superior generalization and accuracy in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition, as a core component of autonomous driving
perception systems, directly influences vehicle environmental awareness and
driving safety. Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,
the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,
resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional
convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution
classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small
targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract
multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage
framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For
traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable
vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to
specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For
traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal
Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a
Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL
learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating
class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method
achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for
all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall,
significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior
accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework combining 2D Gaussian surfels and semantic-guided enhancement to robustly reconstruct road surfaces for autonomous driving, addressing challenges like occlusions and appearance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate road surface reconstruction is crucial for autonomous driving, but existing methods struggle with issues like occlusions, clutter, and environmental changes.

Method: The method integrates occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with planar-adapted Gaussian representation and segmentation-guided video inpainting, alongside semantic-aware color correction in the HSV space.

Result: The approach delivers visually coherent and geometrically accurate road reconstructions, surpassing previous methods in real-world urban environments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates robustness, offering significant improvements in road surface reconstruction for autonomous systems under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Road surface reconstruction is essential for autonomous driving, supporting
centimeter-accurate lane perception and high-definition mapping in complex
urban environments.While recent methods based on mesh rendering or 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) achieve promising results under clean and static conditions,
they remain vulnerable to occlusions from dynamic agents, visual clutter from
static obstacles, and appearance degradation caused by lighting and weather
changes. We present a robust reconstruction framework that integrates
occlusion-aware 2D Gaussian surfels with semantic-guided color enhancement to
recover clean, consistent road surfaces. Our method leverages a planar-adapted
Gaussian representation for efficient large-scale modeling, employs
segmentation-guided video inpainting to remove both dynamic and static
foreground objects, and enhances color coherence via semantic-aware correction
in HSV space. Extensive experiments on urban-scale datasets demonstrate that
our framework produces visually coherent and geometrically faithful
reconstructions, significantly outperforming prior methods under real-world
conditions.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates how image resolution impacts face detection performance among three deep learning models: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN, using the WIDER FACE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge posed by low-resolution imagery on face detection accuracy and robustness in real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors systematically assessed three models (YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN) across varying image resolutions using multiple performance metrics like precision, recall, mAP, and inference time on the WIDER FACE dataset.

Result: YOLOv11 achieves the highest detection accuracy at higher resolutions, YOLOv12 performs better in recall, and MTCNN excels in landmark localization but falls behind in real-time speed.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidance for selecting face detection models based on resolution requirements and operational constraints.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

TL;DR: This paper introduces the largest AI-Generated Talking Head (AGTH) quality assessment dataset, THQA-10K, and proposes a new objective method for quality evaluation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the quality challenges in speech-driven portrait systems, or "talkers," and AGTHs due to limited comprehensive studies in this emerging field.

Method: The authors developed the THQA-10K dataset by generating 10,457 AGTHs using 12 T2I models and 14 talkers, had volunteers rate the outputs subjectively, and proposed an objective quality assessment method based on specific features like first frame, Y-T slice, and tone-lip consistency.

Result: The analysis exposed distortions in current AGTHs, and the proposed objective assessment method achieved state-of-the-art performance in evaluating AGTH quality.

Conclusion: This work enhances the evaluation standards for AGTHs via the THQA-10K dataset and the proposed objective quality assessment method, providing a foundation for advancing this digital human technology.

Abstract: Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as "Talkers"
because of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial
movements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)
models, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging
digital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these
talkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these
issues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest
AGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent
T2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After
excluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset
contains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the
AGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for
subjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in
terms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of
existing AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the
first frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental
results show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
in AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the progression in computer vision architectures, from foundational models to state-of-the-art generative and self-supervised learning techniques.

Method: The study systematically reviews and analyzes key papers in computer vision, focusing on their architectural innovations and contributions to image recognition, generative modeling, and self-supervised learning.

Result: The paper provides insights into the significance of innovations like residual connections, attention mechanisms, adversarial training, denoising in latent spaces, and pre-training through self-distillation and masking.

Conclusion: While foundational models like ResNet enabled deep learning in vision, transformers and novel training methods like Masked Autoencoders have pushed boundaries, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and generative capabilities in computer vision.

Abstract: This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision
by examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational
architectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced
residual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable
effective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.
Subsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new
paradigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image
patches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale
image recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we
investigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
analyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a
generator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,
Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative
methods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually
compressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater
computational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image
generation. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce
dependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a
student network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,
yielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with
Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design
to reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective
method for pre-training large-scale vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in applying NLP-based layer pruning techniques to large vision-language models (LVLMs), proposing a new framework (Short-LVLM) for improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs exhibit high computational costs and massive model parameters, limiting practical applications despite their strong capabilities. The paper aims to explore the applicability of NLP-inspired layer pruning for addressing these challenges.

Method: The authors identify issues like non-essential VL tokens and inter-layer feature gaps in LVLMs and introduce a new framework—Short-LVLM—designed to efficiently utilize important VL tokens while addressing these feature gaps.

Result: Extensive experiments reveal that Short-LVLM achieves a better balance between efficiency and performance, while being training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

Conclusion: Short-LVLM provides a novel, efficient framework for optimizing LVLMs, highlighting its suitability due to compatibility and reduced computational demands. The approach is readily accessible as open-source.

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical
applications are still limited by massive model parameters and high
computational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have
shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free
compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision
and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in
LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer
pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find
that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps
pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL
tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only
achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also
exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and
highly compatible. The code for this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern feature matching methods achieve high performance but suffer from high computational costs due to reliance on the Transformer's quadratic attention mechanism.

Method: The authors propose VMatcher, integrating Mamba's linear complexity Selective State-Space Model (SSM) and parts of the Transformer's attention mechanism in multiple architectures.

Result: VMatcher configurations showcase efficiency gains, compatibility with real-time applications, and demonstrate competitive or superior feature-matching benchmarks.

Conclusion: VMatcher offers a highly efficient and robust solution for feature matching, combining the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for practical real-time applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces VMatcher, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer network for
semi-dense feature matching between image pairs. Learning-based feature
matching methods, whether detector-based or detector-free, achieve
state-of-the-art performance but depend heavily on the Transformer's attention
mechanism, which, while effective, incurs high computational costs due to its
quadratic complexity. In contrast, Mamba introduces a Selective State-Space
Model (SSM) that achieves comparable or superior performance with linear
complexity, offering significant efficiency gains. VMatcher leverages a hybrid
approach, integrating Mamba's highly efficient long-sequence processing with
the Transformer's attention mechanism. Multiple VMatcher configurations are
proposed, including hierarchical architectures, demonstrating their
effectiveness in setting new benchmarks efficiently while ensuring robustness
and practicality for real-time applications where rapid inference is crucial.

Method: The proposed UniEmo framework integrates a hierarchical emotional understanding chain for feature extraction with expert queries and a fusion process for guiding a diffusion model. It introduces emotional correlation coefficients, emotional condition loss, and a data filtering algorithm to enhance the emotional generation and its feedback on the understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate UniEmo's superiority over existing approaches in the domains of emotional understanding and generation.

Conclusion: UniEmo achieves state-of-the-art results by unifying emotional understanding and generation, with dual feedback processes creating a synergistic improvement across tasks.

Abstract: Emotional understanding and generation are often treated as separate tasks,
yet they are inherently complementary and can mutually enhance each other. In
this paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of
emotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for
both tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding
chain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale
emotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.
Simultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to
guide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the
diversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce
the emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the
fusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional
generation guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint
training allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the
understanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to
select high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained
model, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these
generation-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding
capacity. Extensive experiments show that UniEmo significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both emotional understanding and generation tasks.

### [144] [Multi-Prompt Progressive Alignment for Multi-Source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23373)
*Haoran Chen,Zexiao Wang,Haidong Cao,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MP^2A, a progressive alignment method leveraging CLIP for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which mitigates noisy pseudo-label issues for better domain-invariant feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for domain adaptation fail to handle noisy and hard-to-classify samples effectively during alignment, especially in multi-source scenarios.

Method: MP^2A progressively trains the model, starting with high-confidence samples and gradually incorporating more challenging ones to guide the learning process with reduced noise.

Result: MP^2A achieved state-of-the-art results on UDA benchmarks such as ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and DomainNet compared to recent CLIP-based multi-source UDA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed progressive alignment strategy improves robustness and convergence in UDA tasks, delivering enhanced domain-invariant features with lower confirmation bias.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.
State-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for
the target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.
However, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all
pseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with
noisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal
feature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source
scenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple
source domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this
issue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting
CLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a
high-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a
well-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training
progresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the
model to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label
noise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and
promotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely
domain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three
popular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging
DomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art
performance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: The study introduces NeRF-GS, a framework combining Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing 3DGS limitations and enhancing its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting, such as sensitivity to initialization and inter-Gaussian weaknesses, through integration with NeRF.

Method: It aligns the spatial features of 3DGS with NeRF in a joint optimization framework, utilizing shared 3D spatial information and residual vector optimization.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that NeRF-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The results confirm that NeRF and 3DGS complement each other, paving the way for hybrid approaches to efficient 3D scene representation.

Abstract: We introduce NeRF-GS, a novel framework that jointly optimizes Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). This framework
leverages the inherent continuous spatial representation of NeRF to mitigate
several limitations of 3DGS, including sensitivity to Gaussian initialization,
limited spatial awareness, and weak inter-Gaussian correlations, thereby
enhancing its performance. In NeRF-GS, we revisit the design of 3DGS and
progressively align its spatial features with NeRF, enabling both
representations to be optimized within the same scene through shared 3D spatial
information. We further address the formal distinctions between the two
approaches by optimizing residual vectors for both implicit features and
Gaussian positions to enhance the personalized capabilities of 3DGS.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that NeRF-GS surpasses existing
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. This outcome confirms that
NeRF and 3DGS are complementary rather than competing, offering new insights
into hybrid approaches that combine 3DGS and NeRF for efficient 3D scene
representation.

### [146] [AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23402)
*Wei Li,Xun Gong,Jiao Li,Xiaobin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a novel framework for learning structured medical visual representations by adaptively grouping and aligning image patches with text tokens, overcoming limitations in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address two key challenges in learning medical visual representations: the oversimplification of clinical reports in current methods and the impracticality of using large quantities of hard negative samples for contrastive learning in small-scale datasets.

Method: AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism using a sparse similarity matrix to dynamically form visual and language groups, employs adaptive threshold gating modules for dynamic grouping, and introduces new loss functions to enable alignment without external negatives.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates strong performance across public and private datasets, excelling in image-text retrieval and classification tasks in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: AGA effectively captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports, offering a more efficient and accurate method for vision-language representation learning in the medical domain.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a
promising direction in representation learning. However, current
vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify
clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their
inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically
depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for
small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive
Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics
from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping
mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we
compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each
token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch
selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive
grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped
Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping
thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages
based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,
we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each
image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a
Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance
fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.
Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method
achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks
under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel unsupervised OOD detection method using a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art results in medical imaging with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods in medical imaging, which rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction error, often face limitations such as high computational expense, inconsistency, and retraining requirements when data changes.

Method: The proposed method utilizes forward diffusion trajectories from a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM) and estimates trajectory curvature through the Stein score. Anomaly scoring is achieved using only five diffusion steps.

Result: The proposed SBDDM method delivers state-of-the-art OOD detection performance, with relative improvements of up to 10.43% for Near-OOD and 18.10% for Far-OOD benchmarks, while significantly reducing inference computational cost.

Conclusion: SBDDM emerges as a robust, efficient, and generalizable reconstruction-free OOD detection solution for medical imaging, showcasing promising potential for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis.

Abstract: In medical imaging, unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection offers
an attractive approach for identifying pathological cases with extremely low
incidence rates. In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches
function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current
generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction
error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and
require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their
ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,
and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that
leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising
diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated
Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five
diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned
medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD
benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing
computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM
achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and
Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable
computer-aided diagnosis.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a machine learning system utilizing hyperspectral imaging and KNN classification to detect honey adulteration, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated and accurate system for detecting sugar syrup adulteration in honey using hyperspectral imaging, as an alternative to chemical-based methods.

Method: The system consists of two subsystems: one for classifying floral origin and another for detecting adulteration levels. Both subsystems involve LDA for feature extraction and KNN for classification.

Result: The system achieves an overall cross-validation detection accuracy of 96.39% using a public hyperspectral honey image dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning approach is effective and reliable for detecting adulteration in honey, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically
detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral
imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a
botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration
is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection
subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves
extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and
identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed
system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result
indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an
overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate
alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in art style classification by enhancing dual-teacher frameworks using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for improved nonlinear feature modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to overcome the limitations of existing art style classification methods, particularly the scarcity of expertly labeled data and the inability to model global compositional context and complex style-feature interactions.

Method: The authors replace traditional MLP projection and prediction heads in a dual-teacher self-supervised learning framework with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). These networks incorporate spline-based activations to capture nonlinear correlations while using complementary teacher networks focusing on localized patterns and stylistic hierarchies.

Result: Experiments conducted on the WikiArt and Pandora18k datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better Top-1 accuracy and improved linear probe accuracy compared to baseline dual-teacher architectures.

Conclusion: Incorporating KANs into the dual-teacher framework successfully disentangles complex style manifolds, enhancing the model's capability to classify art styles with greater precision.

Abstract: Art style classification remains a formidable challenge in computational
aesthetics due to the scarcity of expertly labeled datasets and the intricate,
often nonlinear interplay of stylistic elements. While recent dual-teacher
self-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear
projection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional
context and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher
knowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing
conventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher
networks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other
capturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based
activations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical
precision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings
highlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,
leading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the efficient compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by proposing a learning-based model called HyCASS for adjustable compression in both spectral and spatial dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of hyperspectral data in remote sensing creates an urgent need for efficient storage and compression. The paper aims to explore the effects of spectral, spatial, and joint spatio-spectral redundancies on HSI compression.

Method: The proposed model, HyCASS, incorporates six main modules (spectral/spatial encoders and decoders, CR adapters) using convolutional layers and transformer blocks to enhance redundancy capture.

Result: Experimental results on two benchmark datasets confirm the model's superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HyCASS is effective for adjustable HSI compression, and the paper provides guidelines for balancing spectral and spatial dimensions based on compression ratios and spatial resolution. The model and code are made publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),
the need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant
attention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,
a comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral
and spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been
thoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for
understanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint
spatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we
propose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network
(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in
both spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)
spectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter
encoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder
module. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to
capture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on
two HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
adjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based
on our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and
spatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial
resolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .

Motivation: The paper addresses the need for advanced methods to analyze medical imaging data, aiming to improve prediction accuracy of patient ailments using machine learning techniques.

Method: Two machine learning models, a baseline CNN and DenseNet-121, were implemented and tested on 5824 chest X-ray images. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to assess decision-making patterns.

Result: Both CNN and DenseNet-121 performed well in the binary classification task, with DenseNet-121 showing enhanced focus on critical image regions for accurate predictions.

Conclusion: The results highlight DenseNet-121’s better performance over the baseline CNN in using relevant image features for the binary classification problem, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in healthcare applications.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of
research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make
predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with
significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex
relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we
implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional

machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline
CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem
presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that
DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray
images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of 'resolution-drift' in federated learning for non-classification tasks, such as human pose estimation, via a novel resolution-adaptive method employing heatmap-based knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore federated learning's adaptability to non-classification tasks, while addressing performance degradation due to resolution variability ('resolution-drift') across clients in distributed systems.

Method: The authors propose Resolution-Adaptive Federated Learning (RAF), a method employing multi-resolution knowledge distillation between teacher (high-resolution) and student (low-resolution) outputs to improve resolution robustness and mitigate overfitting.

Result: Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate RAF's ability to effectively mitigate resolution drift, achieve significant performance improvements, and integrate seamlessly with existing FL frameworks.

Conclusion: RAF improves federated learning's adaptability to tasks relying on spatial detail, such as human pose estimation, and can generalize to other high-resolution tasks beyond classification.

Abstract: The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across
distributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has
primarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication
efficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.
However, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose
estimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a
critical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades
significantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level
heterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as
another axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To
address this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a
method that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through
multi-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs
(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances
resolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and
theoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates
resolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also
can be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although
this paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals
distinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution
representation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks
that rely on preserving spatial detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV tracking datasets lack diversity in scenes and attribute representation, which limits their effectiveness for real-world anti-UAV applications.

Method: The authors propose CST Anti-UAV, a dataset with 220 video sequences, over 240,000 bounding box annotations, and manual frame-level attribute labels for Single Object Tracking of tiny UAVs.

Result: Evaluation of 20 SOT methods on CST Anti-UAV shows only 35.92% state accuracy, highlighting challenges in tracking tiny UAVs and contrasting sharply with higher accuracy on simpler datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CST Anti-UAV dataset identifies significant gaps in current UAV tracking methods and benchmarks, urging advancements in UAV tracking technologies.

Abstract: The widespread application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has raised
serious public safety and privacy concerns, making UAV perception crucial for
anti-UAV tasks. However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature
conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute
representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared
dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex
Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k
high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a
significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex
scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to
incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise
evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance
analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed
dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex
environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only
35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410
dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and
the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV
benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the
development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV

Method: The authors created a high-quality synthetic dataset named Scene-30K and applied reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) using GRPO policy and three reward functions. They also introduced a dynamic view selection strategy.

Result: The 3D-R1 model showed an average improvement of 10% in performance across multiple 3D scene benchmarks.

Conclusion: 3D-R1 is an effective foundation model that advances reasoning and generalization capabilities for 3D scene understanding in VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in 2D
visual understanding tasks, sparking interest in extending these capabilities
to 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D VLMs often struggle with robust
reasoning and generalization due to limitations in high-quality spatial data

CoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine
based on Gemini 2.5 Pro. It serves as cold-start initialization data for 3D-R1.
Moreover, we leverage RLHF policy such as GRPO in the reinforcement learning
training process to enhance reasoning capabilities and introduce three reward
functions: a perception reward, a semantic similarity reward and a format
reward to maintain detection accuracy and answer semantic precision.
Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic view selection strategy that adaptively
chooses the most informative perspectives for 3D scene understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that 3D-R1 delivers an average improvement of 10%

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of short battery life in video capsule endoscopy devices by integrating efficient AI models to reduce energy usage and improve performance.

Method: The researchers developed a multi-task neural network with functionalities for precise self-localization and anomaly detection in the gastrointestinal tract. The model uses a parameter-efficient design and integrates multi-task techniques with Viterbi decoding for time-series analysis, tested on the Galar dataset.

Result: The model achieved 93.63% accuracy for self-localization and 87.48% accuracy for anomaly detection. It uses only 1 million parameters and outperformed existing single-task baselines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a parameter-efficient multi-task neural network enhances video capsule endoscopy capabilities by enabling high accuracy for multiple tasks, thereby representing a significant improvement in AI-based solutions for this field.

Abstract: Video capsule endoscopy has become increasingly important for investigating
the small intestine within the gastrointestinal tract. However, a persistent
challenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge
devices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation
by enabling intelligent real-time decision- making, thereby reducing the energy
consumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging
due to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the
overall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that
combines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the
gastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small
intestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we
consistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the
feasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first
multi-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating
established multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series
analysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a
significant ad- vance in AI-based approaches in this field. Our model achieves
an accu- racy of 93.63% on the localization task and an accuracy of 87.48% on

curve, we can efficiently identify subsequent sample points without
exhaustively computing all pairwise distances. Our proposal substantially
accelerates farthest point sampling and neighbor search operations while
preserving sampling quality and model performance. By integrating FastPoint
into state-of-the-art 3D point cloud models, we achieve 2.55x end-to-end

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-captured 3D data for real-world 3D visual tasks, overcoming struggles tied to current methods relying on predefined physical priors.

Method: Stable-Sim2Real employs a two-stage diffusion model: the first stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion for coarse depth generation, while the second stage refines it using adjusted diffusion loss informed by a 3D discriminator.

Result: The proposed method significantly boosts performance in real-world 3D visual tasks and shows high similarity between simulated and real-captured 3D data patterns.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Stable-Sim2Real method offers an effective solution for realistic 3D data simulation, enabling improved performance in real-world applications and offering a benchmark for future methods.

Abstract: 3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured
3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D
data simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to
capture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning
an implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,
but progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work
explores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called
Stable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial
stage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and
synthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local
regions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the
synthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where
diffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a
3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data
simulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with
the 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances
performance in real-world 3D visual tasks. Moreover, the evaluation
demonstrates the high similarity between our 3D simulated data and
real-captured patterns. Project page:

### [158] [Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment for Infrared-Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23508)
*Timing Li,Bing Cao,Jiahe Feng,Haifang Cao,Qinghau Hu,Pengfei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hyperbolic Cycle Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign), a novel method using hyperbolic space for more effective cross-modal image registration and fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing image registration methods, which struggle to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively in Euclidean space, thereby impacting image fusion quality.

Method: The Hy-CycleAlign method utilizes a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework in hyperbolic space. It includes a forward and backward registration network forming a closed-loop structure and a Hyperbolic Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module for sensitive registration.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both image alignment and fusion on misaligned multi-modal image datasets.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space enables more effective multi-modal image registration than Euclidean space, demonstrating the potential of Hy-CycleAlign for applications requiring precise cross-modal data alignment and fusion.

Abstract: Image fusion synthesizes complementary information from multiple sources,
mitigating the inherent limitations of unimodal imaging systems. Accurate image
registration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,
existing registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean
space, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in
suboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we
explore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle
Alignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign
is the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces
a dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward
registration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration
network reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration
structure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic
Hierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into
hyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing
interference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image
registration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that
hyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image
registration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
both image alignment and fusion. Our code will be publicly available.

*David A. Kelly,Akchunya Chanchal,Nathan Blake*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores using minimal sufficient pixel sets to understand how different image classification models work and compares their decision-making for correct and misclassified images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting the right machine learning classifier for image recognition, given limited understanding of their decision-making processes.

Method: The authors utilize minimal sufficient pixel sets to analyze the 'concentration' or essence of images captured by different models, comparing pixel set size, overlap, and position across models.

Result: Finds statistically significant differences in pixel concentration among models, particularly for ConvNext and EVA architectures. Also, misclassified images require larger pixel sets than correctly classified ones.

Conclusion: Understanding model concentration through minimal pixel sets provides insights into model behavior and differences in architecture, highlighting complexities in misclassification.

Abstract: Machine learning for image classification is an active and rapidly developing
field. With the proliferation of classifiers of different sizes and different
architectures, the problem of choosing the right model becomes more and more
important.
  While we can assess a model's classification accuracy statistically, our
understanding of the way these models work is unfortunately limited. In order
to gain insight into the decision-making process of different vision models, we
propose using minimal sufficient pixels sets to gauge a model's
`concentration': the pixels that capture the essence of an image through the
lens of the model. By comparing position, overlap, and size of sets of pixels,
we identify that different architectures have statistically different
concentration, in both size and position. In particular, ConvNext and EVA
models differ markedly from the others. We also identify that images which are
misclassified are associated with larger pixels sets than correct
classifications.

*Gopika Sudhakaran,Hikaru Shindo,Patrick Schramowski,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Kristian Kersting,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents ART, a framework for improving Visual Relation Detection (VRD) using instruction tuning and adaptive instance selection to generalize well to unseen and complex relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VRD models struggle to generalize beyond their training data, and prompt tuning with handcrafted prompts falls short in handling novel or complex relations.

Method: The authors propose ART, which converts VRD datasets into an instruction-tuning format, uses strategic adaptive sampling, and fine-tunes vision-language models to improve generalizability.

Result: ART significantly outperforms baselines in predicting relations, including unseen concepts, and demonstrates practical applications like scene segmentation.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning paired with adaptive sampling is an effective approach for enhancing the generalizability of VRD models, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships
between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection
data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.
While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for
VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.
We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by
fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an
Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction
tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an
instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART
directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining
generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where
subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between
them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets
of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and
can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD
methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations
for segmenting complex scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications often involve new environments and object categories, challenging existing monocular 3D object detection methods designed for closed-set settings.

Method: The authors designed a 3D bounding box head for lifting open-set 2D detection into 3D and enabling joint end-to-end training. Additionally, they developed a canonical image space for cross-dataset training.

Result: 3D-MOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-set (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet).

Conclusion: 3D-MOOD provides an innovative solution for open-set monocular 3D object detection, advancing performance and generalization across diverse real-world scenes.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection is valuable for various applications such as
robotics and AR/VR. Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where
the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object
categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments
and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this
paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and
introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD).
We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed
3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D
tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with
geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse
scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for
more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set
settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Code and models are available at

*Maxime Pietrantoni,Gabriela Csurka,Torsten Sattler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new scene representation for visual localization called Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), combining 3D geometric modeling with implicit feature learning for accurate and privacy-preserving localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a visual localization method that ensures accuracy while maintaining privacy in known environments using advanced representations.

Method: The paper integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit feature fields, leveraging contrastive learning to align 3D scale-aware features with 2D feature encoders in a shared embedding space. It uses clustering techniques informed by 3D data and a pose refinement strategy.

Result: The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and privacy-preserving capabilities on multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using the GSFFs framework provides both high-accuracy localization and enhanced privacy, outperforming existing methods in its application domains.

Abstract: Visual localization is the task of estimating a camera pose in a known
environment. In this paper, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based
representations for accurate and privacy-preserving visual localization. We
propose Gaussian Splatting Feature Fields (GSFFs), a scene representation for
visual localization that combines an explicit geometry model (3DGS) with an
implicit feature field. We leverage the dense geometric information and
differentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature
representations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware
feature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a
contrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we
further regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the
features to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual
localization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or
segmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene
representation, is used to achieve localization. The resulting privacy- and
non-privacy-preserving localization pipelines, evaluated on multiple real-world
datasets, show state-of-the-art performances.

*Sobhan Asasi,Mohamed Ilyas Lakhal,Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BeyondGloss, a novel gloss-free framework for Sign Language Translation (SLT) leveraging Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) with enhancements for detailed temporal analysis of hand movements, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT models struggle to bridge the visual-linguistic modality gap and capture intricate hand movements in video data effectively.

Method: The BeyondGloss framework improves SLT by generating fine-grained textual descriptions of hand motion, using a contrastive alignment module to focus on temporal dynamics, distilling features from HaMeR, and applying contrastive loss to reduce the modality gap.

Result: BeyondGloss surpasses existing models by achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily datasets.

Conclusion: BeyondGloss successfully addresses challenges in SLT by improving hand-centric temporal representations and bridging modality gaps, validating its efficacy through benchmark results.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that requires bridging
the modality gap between visual and linguistic information while capturing
subtle variations in hand shapes and movements. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{BeyondGloss}, a novel gloss-free SLT framework that leverages
the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of Video Large Language Models
(VideoLLMs). Since existing VideoLLMs struggle to model long videos in detail,
we propose a novel approach to generate fine-grained, temporally-aware textual
descriptions of hand motion. A contrastive alignment module aligns these
descriptions with video features during pre-training, encouraging the model to
focus on hand-centric temporal dynamics and distinguish signs more effectively.
To further enrich hand-specific representations, we distill fine-grained
features from HaMeR. Additionally, we apply a contrastive loss between sign
video representations and target language embeddings to reduce the modality gap
in pre-training. \textbf{BeyondGloss} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Phoenix14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. We will release the code upon acceptance of the paper.

*Yaoye Zhu,Zhe Wang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MamV2XCalib, a novel V2X-based method leveraging vehicle-side LiDAR for automatic calibration of roadside cameras. Unlike traditional methods, it eliminates the need for manual intervention or specific reference objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges of traditional manual calibration methods for infrastructure cameras, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and disruptive, making large-scale precise calibration increasingly critical for the efficiency and safety of cooperative autonomous systems.

Method: The proposed MamV2XCalib method uses vehicle-side LiDAR-driven calibration while requiring only autonomous vehicles to drive near the cameras. It integrates a targetless LiDAR-camera calibration model employing multi-scale features and a 4D correlation volume to estimate data correlation and uses the Mamba technique to address issues like occlusion and viewpoint differences.

Result: MamV2XCalib achieved effective and robust calibration on the V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X datasets, surpassing traditional LiDAR-camera calibration methods in performance and stability while using fewer parameters.

Conclusion: MamV2XCalib demonstrates a significant improvement in V2X infrastructure camera calibration by providing an automated, efficient, and robust solution that avoids the drawbacks of traditional manual methods, advancing the field of autonomous vehicle perception.

Abstract: As cooperative systems that leverage roadside cameras to assist autonomous
vehicle perception become increasingly widespread, large-scale precise
calibration of infrastructure cameras has become a critical issue. Traditional
manual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
require road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based
infrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side
LiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to
drive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need
for specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new
targetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features
and a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side
point clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and
estimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration
failures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as
occlusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the
V2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
and robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to
previous LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach
achieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with
fewer parameters. The code is available at

TL;DR: MoGA reconstructs high-fidelity 3D Gaussian avatars from single-view images using generative models and 2D diffusion for unseen details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in reconstructing consistent and realistic 3D avatars from single-view images, overcoming limitations of sparse and inconsistent generation methods.

Method: Integrates generative avatar models with 2D diffusion-based synthetic views, leveraging latent space projection, additional 3D constraints, and inversion processes.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes effectively to real-world scenarios, producing animatable Gaussian avatars.

Conclusion: MoGA improves realism and consistency in 3D avatar reconstruction, offering a novel inversion-based approach that surpasses existing techniques and enables animation.

Abstract: We present MoGA, a novel method to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian
avatars from a single-view image. The main challenge lies in inferring unseen
appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.
Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;
however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in
unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,
we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by
sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the
limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all
image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,
ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and
enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel
approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by
fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The
generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting,
enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments
show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well
to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 2D approach aimed at improving real-time 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, achieving both accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving methods prioritize accuracy but fail to support real-time requirements effectively, leading to challenges in balancing performance with computational efficiency.

Method: A directional pure 2D approach is employed where 3D voxel features are sliced to retain vertical geometric information, augmented by a directional attention mechanism to extract features efficiently from various orientations.

Result: The proposed method achieves an mIoU of 39.3% at 27.7 FPS, with edge device simulations showcasing an inference speed of 14.8 FPS, indicating practical applicability.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a viable solution for balancing accuracy and speed in 3D occupancy prediction, suitable for real-time deployment in autonomous driving scenarios and resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Efficient and high-accuracy 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for ensuring
the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, many current
methods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To
address this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a
directional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to
preserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for
the loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby
maintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a
directional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from
different orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our
approach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method
achieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively
balancing accuracy and efficiency. In simulations on edge devices, the
inference speed reaches 14.8 FPS, further demonstrating the method's
applicability for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vcamba is a novel method for video camouflaged object detection that combines spatial and frequency features to enhance motion perception and detection accuracy, outperforming existing methods with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VCOD techniques struggle with limited detection accuracy due to high similarity between foreground and background. Frequency features and the Mamba model motivate the need for more efficient motion perception methods.

Method: Vcamba integrates spatial and frequency features using modules like RFVSS, AFE, SLMP, FLMP, and SFMF for enhanced spatio-frequency motion perception and unified representation.

Result: Vcamba achieves superior performance across 6 metrics on 2 datasets while reducing computational costs, validating its effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Vcamba provides an innovative approach for improving video camouflaged object detection by effectively combining spatial and frequency domains for efficient and accurate detection.

Abstract: Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on
spatial appearance features to perceive motion cues for breaking camouflage.
However, the high similarity between foreground and background in VCOD results
in limited discriminability of spatial appearance features (e.g., color and
texture), restricting detection accuracy and completeness. Recent studies
demonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation
to compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through
dynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space
model called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame
sequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated
by this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on
spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial
features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive
field visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features
after sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive
frequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain
sequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Then we propose
a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based
long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and
frequency-temporal sequences in spatial and frequency phase domains. Finally,
the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain
features for unified motion representation. Experimental results show that our
Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2
datasets with lower computation cost, confirming the superiority of Vcamba. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/BoydeLi/Vcamba.

TL;DR: The paper discusses MIDI-B, a DICOM image de-identification (deID) challenge aimed at ensuring patient privacy while preserving metadata critical for biomedical research. This initiative provided a standardized benchmarking platform using synthetic PHI/PII in real medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for effective de-identification tools that conform to privacy regulations like HIPAA while maintaining research-critical metadata, given the increasing need for sharing anonymized medical images in AI research.

Method: The MIDI-B Challenge was designed in three phases (training, validation, and test) using diverse, multi-modality real radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII. Participants employed rule-based approaches, large language models, and OCR for de-identification.

Result: Ten teams completed the test phase, achieving scores between 97.91% and 99.93% for correctly de-identifying images. Participants used various tools and configurations.

Conclusion: The challenge demonstrated the feasibility of benchmarking deID tools, offered insights into effective de-identification methods, and emphasized the importance of preserving metadata for downstream AI applications in biomedical research.

Abstract: The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and
personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for
sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure
compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI
metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial
intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The
goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM
image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor
regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in
preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and
multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic
PHI/PII inserted.
  The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and
test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase,
we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or
public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images
containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten
teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure
success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the
percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The
scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of
open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large
language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we
provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design,
implementation, results, and lessons learned.

*Yucheng Xie,Fu Feng,Ruixiao Shi,Jing Wang,Yong Rui,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DivControl, a framework for efficient and unified controllable image generation, improving generalization and reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for image generation fail to generalize efficiently across conditions and are costly to adapt for new tasks.

Method: DivControl employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to factorize ControlNet into disentangled "learngenes" and condition-specific "tailors" during multi-condition training, along with knowledge diversion and representation alignment techniques.

Result: DivControl reduces training costs by 36.4×, achieves state-of-the-art controllability, and excels in zero-shot and few-shot learning for unseen conditions.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalability, transferability, and modularity, establishing a robust foundation for controllable generation across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image
(I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps,
enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train
separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with
entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation
costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable
pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient
adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic
components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into
condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge
diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented
via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the
semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and
parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve
condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation
alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art
controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously
improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong
zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior
scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Motivation: Current FS-CS methods achieve high accuracy but struggle with small objects and inefficient parameter usage.

Method: Introduces EMAT with a memory-efficient masked attention, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency improvements.

Result: EMAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL-5^i and COCO-20^i datasets while using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: EMAT enhances small-object classification and segmentation performance, and the paper introduces new evaluation settings to utilize costly annotations better in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) focuses on jointly
performing multi-label classification and multi-class segmentation using few
annotated examples. Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we
propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves
classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT
introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention
mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency
enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and
COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters.
Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available
annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation
settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Difficulty in training Spiking Neural Networks due to their non-differentiability and the computational inefficiency of current gradient approximation approaches inspired the research.

Method: The authors propose an FF-based framework that treats spiking activations as black-box modules and introduces a class-aware complexity adaptation mechanism to optimize resource allocation dynamically.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art test accuracies of 99.58% (MNIST), 92.13% (Fashion-MNIST), and 75.64% (CIFAR-10), along with reductions in memory and computational power usage.

Conclusion: The proposed method overcomes the limitations of gradient approximations, providing a biologically plausible, energy-efficient, and accurate framework for SNN training, especially suitable for edge devices.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible framework for
energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. However, it is a challenge to train
SNNs due to their non-differentiability, efficiently. Existing gradient
approximation approaches frequently sacrifice accuracy and face deployment
limitations on edge devices due to the substantial computational requirements
of backpropagation. To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward
(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural
Networks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby
eliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing
computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity
adaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on
inter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network
resources across different categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
our proposed training framework achieves test accuracies of 99.58%, 92.13%, and
75.64% on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively,
surpassing all existing FF-based SNN approaches. Additionally, our proposed
method exhibits significant advantages in terms of memory access and
computational power consumption.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptively Distilled ControlNet, a training framework for medical segmentation models with improved performance and privacy-preservation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address privacy concerns and the labor-intensive nature of medical image annotation that limit the effectiveness and generalizability of segmentation models.

Method: The framework employs dual-model distillation with a teacher-student model setup, conditioned on lesion masks, alongside adaptive regularization based on lesion-background ratios.

Result: Testing on two medical datasets (KiTS19 and Polyps) shows significant improvement in mDice and mIoU for TransUNet and SANet segmentation models, with respective gains of 2.4%-4.2% and 2.6%-3.5%.

Conclusion: The framework not only preserves privacy but also enhances the accuracy of medical image segmentation, outperforming existing methods in diverse datasets.

Abstract: Medical image annotation is constrained by privacy concerns and
labor-intensive labeling, significantly limiting the performance and
generalization of segmentation models. While mask-controllable diffusion models
excel in synthesis, they struggle with precise lesion-mask alignment. We
propose \textbf{Adaptively Distilled ControlNet}, a task-agnostic framework
that accelerates training and optimization through dual-model distillation.
Specifically, during training, a teacher model, conditioned on mask-image
pairs, regularizes a mask-only student model via predicted noise alignment in
parameter space, further enhanced by adaptive regularization based on
lesion-background ratios. During sampling, only the student model is used,
enabling privacy-preserving medical image generation. Comprehensive evaluations
on two distinct medical datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance:
TransUNet improves mDice/mIoU by 2.4%/4.2% on KiTS19, while SANet achieves
2.6%/3.5% gains on Polyps, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model, addresses challenges in zero-shot transfer for human trajectory prediction by explicitly conditioning on temporal metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of zero-shot transfer in human trajectory prediction due to varying temporal dynamics in unseen datasets.

Method: Systematically investigated temporal generalization and proposed a Transformer-based model, OmniTraj, with explicit temporal conditioning.

Result: OmniTraj achieves over 70% error reduction in zero-shot scenarios and state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets after fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Explicitly conditioning on temporal metadata is an effective solution for achieving robust zero-shot transfer in human trajectory prediction.

Abstract: While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a
critical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying
temporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require
fine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation
horizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we
systematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We
first demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when
transferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the
temporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit
conditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.
Based on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model
pre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that
explicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve
state-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by
over 70\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj
achieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,
WorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

Conclusion: SAMSA effectively addresses HSI segmentation issues, allowing for flexible integration of datasets with varying spectral characteristics and requiring minimal training examples.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical
imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and
hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation
framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA
efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral
similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI
segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates
independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on
publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a
neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents I2V-GS, a novel method to generate driving data for autonomous systems by transforming infrastructure views to vehicle views using Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving data collection methods are costly and inefficient, and synthesizing data from real-world images is a promising solution.

Method: The method utilizes adaptive depth warp for dense views, a cascade strategy for inpainting consistent content, and confidence-guided optimization using cross-view information. Additionally, the authors introduce RoadSight, a multi-modality dataset.

Result: I2V-GS achieves significantly improved data synthesis quality, outperforming StreetGaussian in multiple metrics: NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID with improvements of up to 45.7%.

Conclusion: I2V-GS is a pioneering framework for transforming infrastructure views to vehicle views, enhancing autonomous driving data synthesis quality efficiently.

Abstract: Vast and high-quality data are essential for end-to-end autonomous driving
systems. However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which
is expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data
from real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate
photorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating
driving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel
method, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with
Gaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and
rendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt
the adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the
range of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which
also ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure
the reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information
to perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a
multi-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.
To our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving
datasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation. Experimental results
demonstrate that I2V-GS significantly improves synthesis quality under vehicle
view, outperforming StreetGaussian in NTA-Iou, NTL-Iou, and FID by 45.7%,
34.2%, and 14.9%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AiOIR is promising for image restoration but challenging due to diverse degradations. The authors aim to address these challenges by leveraging latent diffusion models.

Method: The framework integrates low-quality visual priors into LDMs and introduces two novel modules: the Degradation-Aware Feature Fusion (DAFF) for handling diverse degradations and the Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) for enhancing texture recovery.

Result: Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method across tasks with multiple and mixed degradation types.

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of diffusion priors in addressing diverse degradations for unified image restoration, showing high practical potential.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has emerged as a promising yet
challenging research direction. To address its core challenges, we propose a
novel unified image restoration framework based on latent diffusion models
(LDMs). Our approach structurally integrates low-quality visual priors into the
diffusion process, unlocking the powerful generative capacity of diffusion
models for diverse degradations. Specifically, we design a Degradation-Aware
Feature Fusion (DAFF) module to enable adaptive handling of diverse degradation
types. Furthermore, to mitigate detail loss caused by the high compression and
iterative sampling of LDMs, we design a Detail-Aware Expert Module (DAEM) in
the decoder to enhance texture and fine-structure recovery. Extensive
experiments across multi-task and mixed degradation settings demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
practical potential of diffusion priors for unified image restoration. Our code
will be released.

*Zhenyang Li,Xiaoyang Bai,Tongchen Zhang,Pengfei Shen,Weiwei Xu,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlowGaussian-VR, a model for high-quality 3D video reconstruction in challenging motion scenarios through its velocity field and flow-based adaptive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in high-fidelity 3D video reconstruction, particularly for videos with complex motion and scale variations where current methods may overfit or fail to represent dynamic content effectively.

Method: The authors propose FlowGaussian-VR, incorporating velocity field rendering for optical flow optimization and flow-assisted adaptive densification to adjust Gaussian number and size in dynamic regions.

Result: FlowGaussian-VR demonstrated over 2.5 dB PSNR improvement, reduced blurry artifacts in textures, and yielded trackable Gaussian trajectories in tests across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively enhances dynamic 3D video reconstruction and view synthesis, addressing the limitations of existing approaches in handling challenging scenarios.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time
rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented
reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has
achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great
representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with
complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often
overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual
quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for
static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic
content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity
field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed
FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering
(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a
flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and
size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on
multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple
real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not
only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry
artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian
trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to enhance pixel attribution maps for image classification while incorporating risk estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pixel attribution methods used for deep learning in image classification do not adequately account for the risk associated with model predictions, which may lead to unsafe surgical decisions.

Method: The method iteratively creates a volume of pixel attribution maps (PA maps), generates pixel-wise distributions, and computes enhanced PA maps and their risk using expectation values and the coefficient of variation.

Result: Application on Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet datasets shows that the proposed explainability method outperforms existing approaches.

Conclusion: The enhanced PA maps with integrated risk estimation improve the reliability and explainability of image classification models for applications like intraoperative tissue characterization.

Abstract: The deployment of Machine Learning models intraoperatively for tissue
characterisation can assist decision making and guide safe tumour resections.
For image classification models, pixel attribution methods are popular to infer
explainability. However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions
translates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose
the first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution
method for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method
iteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to
create a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate
a pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an
enhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise
distributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to
estimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method
not only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on
the output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser
Endomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved
explainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.

*Emery Pierson,Lei Li,Angela Dai,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a data-driven approach for functional map regularization and training in non-rigid shape correspondence, replacing traditional axiomatic strategies with a novel generative model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in deep functional maps rely on axiomatic modeling to define training loss and regularization, which is limiting in accuracy and applicability.

Method: The authors train a generative model in the spectral domain using score-based diffusion modeling, and use it for structural regularization of functional maps without relying on traditional axiomatic constraints.

Result: The proposed approach improves zero-shot non-rigid shape correspondence accuracy, surpassing existing methods that employ axiomatic regularization strategies.

Conclusion: The learned model is category-agnostic and effectively replaces traditional axiomatic functional map strategies, offering a more generalizable and accurate solution for non-rigid shape matching tasks.

Abstract: Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving
non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine
the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven
learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods
in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and
still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for
functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the
accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios
where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the
first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can
be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative
model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative
modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit
the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth
functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used
strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of
functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation
strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate
that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic
approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching. Our code is available at:

*Rongzhen Zhao,Yi Zhao,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Slot Attention with re-Initialization and self-Distillation" (DIAS) to address issues in Object-Centric Learning (OCL) such as redundant slots and lack of supervision beyond reconstruction. DIAS improves object discovery and recognition while enhancing visual reasoning and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitations in Object-Centric Learning, where redundant slots compete for object representation, leading to segmentation errors. Additionally, they address the lack of supervision beyond slot decoding for scene reconstruction.

Method: DIAS introduces two innovations: 1) Re-initialization of the redundant slots and extra aggregation to update informative slots, and 2) Self-distillation, where early poor attention maps approximate the improved ones from later iterations.

Result: DIAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in object discovery, recognition, advanced visual prediction, and reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Proposed enhancements in DIAS significantly improve the quality of object-centric scene representation, making it a valuable advancement in visual scene understanding.

Abstract: Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning
(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,
termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.
OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying
competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the
query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing
redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This
often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,
mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into
the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal
information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with
re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce
redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to
update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the
first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to
enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves
state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also
improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning. Our code is available on

TL;DR: This paper introduces SeqAffordSplat, a benchmark for long-horizon 3D affordance reasoning, and SeqSplatNet, a model for sequential 3D affordance mask prediction, addressing semantic ambiguities and complex geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D affordance reasoning are limited to single-object, single-step interactions, which do not address the needs of multi-object, long-horizon tasks in real-world applications.

Method: The authors propose SeqSplatNet, employing a large language model to produce 3D affordance masks, pre-train using Conditional Geometric Reconstruction, and integrate rich semantic features from 2D Vision Foundation Models for improved understanding.

Result: SeqSplatNet sets a new state-of-the-art on the SeqAffordSplat benchmark by effectively handling complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Conclusion: SeqSplatNet advances 3D affordance reasoning by enabling sequential, scene-level understanding, paving the way for more capable embodied agents.

Abstract: 3D affordance reasoning, the task of associating human instructions with the
functional regions of 3D objects, is a critical capability for embodied agents.
Current methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are fundamentally limited
to single-object, single-step interactions, a paradigm that falls short of
addressing the long-horizon, multi-object tasks required for complex real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D
Gaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale
benchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance
understanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an
end-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D
affordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that
autoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,
guiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle
complex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional
Geometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete
affordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a
robust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design
a feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision
Foundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art
on our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from
single-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a new approach to integrate SMPL-X 3D human models into physical simulations for realistic interactions with objects and scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current kinematic-based 3D human models like SMPL-X can't physically interact with the environment, leading to issues like interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics.

Method: The authors propose a 'half-physics' mechanism that bridges kinematic motion and physics simulations, combining SMPL-X model control with physically plausible object interactions while avoiding reinforcement learning.

Result: The new method eliminates object penetration and unrealistic dynamics, generalizes to all body shapes and motions, operates in real time, and retains original kinematic motion fidelity.

Conclusion: This research offers a practical, learning-free solution for enabling realistic physical interactions in 3D human models without compromising the accuracy of kinematic motion.

Abstract: While current general-purpose 3D human models (e.g., SMPL-X) efficiently
represent accurate human shape and pose, they lacks the ability to physically
interact with the environment due to the kinematic nature. As a result,
kinematic-based interaction models often suffer from issues such as
interpenetration and unrealistic object dynamics. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable
of dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings. Specifically, we
propose a "half-physics" mechanism that transforms 3D kinematic motion into a
physics simulation. Our approach maintains kinematic control over inherent
SMPL-X poses while ensuring physically plausible interactions with scenes and
objects, effectively eliminating penetration and unrealistic object dynamics.
Unlike reinforcement learning-based methods, which demand extensive and complex
training, our half-physics method is learning-free and generalizes to any body
shape and motion; meanwhile, it operates in real time. Moreover, it preserves
the fidelity of the original kinematic motion while seamlessly integrating
physical interactions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and reliability of GUI grounding, a crucial component for enabling effective actions in Computer Use Agents (CUAs). Current models struggle with low accuracy, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: An empirical study was conducted detailing the process from data collection to model training. The authors developed the Phi-Ground model family, which was evaluated using challenging benchmarks in agent and end-to-end settings.

Result: Phi-Ground achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across five benchmarks for models under 10 billion parameters, with scores of 43.2 on ScreenSpot-pro and 27.2 on UI-Vision in end-to-end settings.

Conclusion: The research makes significant progress in GUI grounding, setting higher benchmarks for accuracy and reliability. It also provides detailed insights that may benefit other perception tasks in multimodal systems.

Abstract: With the development of multimodal reasoning models, Computer Use Agents
(CUAs), akin to Jarvis from \textit{"Iron Man"}, are becoming a reality. GUI
grounding is a core component for CUAs to execute actual actions, similar to
mechanical control in robotics, and it directly leads to the success or failure
of the system. It determines actions such as clicking and typing, as well as
related parameters like the coordinates for clicks. Current end-to-end
grounding models still achieve less than 65\% accuracy on challenging
benchmarks like ScreenSpot-pro and UI-Vision, indicating they are far from
being ready for deployment. % , as a single misclick can result in unacceptable
consequences. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the training of
grounding models, examining details from data collection to model training.
Ultimately, we developed the \textbf{Phi-Ground} model family, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models
under $10B$ parameters in agent settings. In the end-to-end model setting, our
model still achieves SOTA results with scores of \textit{\textbf{43.2}} on
ScreenSpot-pro and \textit{\textbf{27.2}} on UI-Vision. We believe that the
various details discussed in this paper, along with our successes and failures,
not only clarify the construction of grounding models but also benefit other

Motivation: Conventional dense multi-view systems for reconstructing dynamic scenes are expensive and not practical for capturing diverse, in-the-wild human behaviors. A more accessible sparse-view system is needed.

Method: The authors introduced a method that aligns independent monocular reconstructions from multiple cameras to produce coherent dynamic scene reconstructions suitable for sparse-view setups.

Result: Their method outperforms prior techniques in generating high-quality, time- and view-consistent reconstructions, especially for novel views, as evidenced by experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

Conclusion: This new approach enables more practical, cost-effective dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view cameras, broadening accessibility and application scope.

Abstract: We address the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse-view
videos. Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of
calibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are
prohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.
In contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a
bike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene
coverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that
dense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view
setup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,
we carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to
produce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive
experiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method
achieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when
rendering novel views. Code, data, and data-processing scripts are available on

*Jessica Bader,Leander Girrbach,Stephan Alaniz,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) lack robustness under distribution shifts. The paper introduces SUB, a synthetic image dataset for testing CBMs, and proposes the Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method for precise data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of CBMs' lack of robustness in identifying correct concepts when faced with distribution shifts, a vital problem for transparency in AI applications, especially in sensitive fields like medicine.

Method: The authors created a new benchmark called SUB, which consists of 38,400 synthetic images based on the CUB dataset. They also developed Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG), a method for accurately generating images with specific attributes to evaluate interpretability.

Result: The SUB benchmark and TDG method provide precise control over image generation, allowing researchers to rigorously test the robustness of CBMs and other interpretable models under concept variations.

Conclusion: SUB and the TDG methodology contribute significantly to advancing interpretable AI by enabling robust evaluation of model transparency, laying the groundwork for developing more dependable methods.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models
show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is
essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that
CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution
shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce
SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic
images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33
bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific
concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied
Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where
noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the
correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel
benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models,
contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available

*Bowen Zhang,Sicheng Xu,Chuxin Wang,Jiaolong Yang,Feng Zhao,Dong Chen,Baining Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for generating dynamic 3D content (4D generation) using single video inputs and achieves superior results using a novel approach to diffusion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality dynamic 3D animations from video inputs is complex due to challenges in handling 4D data and its high-dimensional representation.

Method: The authors developed a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE for efficient encoding and compression, combined with a temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer for training on animatable 3D objects.

Result: Their model outperforms existing methods, demonstrating high-quality generation while generalizing effectively to real-world video inputs, even with training limited to synthetic data.

Conclusion: This work pushes the boundaries of 4D generation and presents a promising approach for leveraging video inputs for creating animated 3D content with broad applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that
creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D
diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and
the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and
motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS
Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and
their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting,
and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space.
Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation
Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on
input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D
objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation
quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable
generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on
synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

### [187] [H2SGEMM: Emulating FP32 GEMM on Ascend NPUs using FP16 Units with Precision Recovery and Cache-Aware Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23387)
*Weicheng Xue,Baisong Xu,Kai Yang,Yongxiang Liu,Dengdeng Fan,Pengxiang Xu,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents H2SGEMM, a method to emulate FP32 matrix multiplication using FP16 computation units, achieving up to 77% of FP32-equivalent performance and enhanced numerical accuracy under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of full-precision computation support in low-precision matrix engines (e.g., FP16), which restricts their usage for applications requiring FP32 precision.

Method: The method involves decomposing FP32 operands into FP16 values and introducing a tunable scaling strategy to manage numerical errors. It incorporates a term-wise accumulation scheme for numerical stability and uses cache-aware blocking and double-buffered pipeline strategies for high performance.

Result: H2SGEMM recovers native FP32 GEMM accuracy, offers up to 77% of FP32-equivalent peak performance on the Ascend 910A NPU, and achieves superior numerical stability in low-exponent regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed H2SGEMM algorithm enables efficient and accurate FP32 emulation on FP16 hardware, highlighting its potential for AI accelerators lacking native FP32 support.

Abstract: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but
lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose H2SGEMM,
a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix
multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI
accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and
compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed
analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision
loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of
mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on
accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves
numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes.
Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are
introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling H2SGEMM to
achieve up to 77% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend
910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm
that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also
exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its
structured and error-aware computation order.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the RAES algorithm under a dynamic graph model induced by streaming node-churn and proves its robustness for maintaining expansion properties in dynamic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address the open question from prior work on analyzing RAES in a dynamic graph setting, specifically a node-churn, sliding-window model.

Method: The paper studies RAES under a dynamic graph sequence $
{G_t}$ generated by node churn, proving expansion properties for snapshots and analyzing rumor spreading protocols within this setup.

Result: With high probability, every snapshot in the dynamic graph maintains good expansion properties, and rumor spreading protocols achieve a logarithmic upper bound on completion time.

Conclusion: RAES is effective for use in dynamic graph models, showing robust expansion and supporting efficient rumor spreading protocols in peer-to-peer dynamic networks.

Abstract: A randomized distributed algorithm called RAES was introduced in [Becchetti
et al., SODA 2020] to extract a bounded-degree expander from a dense $n$-vertex
expander graph $G = (V, E)$. The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based
procedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input
graph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain
unchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models
is left as a major open question.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model
induced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window
model), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the
oldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph
$\mathcal{G} =\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \in \mathbb{N}\}$ that captures essential
characteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and
threshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that
every snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion
properties with high probability. Furthermore, we leverage this property to
establish a logarithmic upper bound on the completion time of the well-known
PUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols over the dynamic graph $\mathcal{G}$.

*Xueying Wu,Baijun Zhou,Zhihui Gao,Yuzhe Fu,Qilin Zheng,Yintao He,Hai Li*

TL;DR: This paper introduces KLLM, a hardware-software framework optimizing LLM inference with K-Means quantization and a novel online outlier detection engine, achieving significant speedups and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome accuracy degradation and computational inefficiencies in LLM inference caused by existing uniform integer-based quantization and ineffective activation outlier handling methods.

Method: KLLM integrates index-based computation for K-Means quantized data to minimize dequantization, and introduces Orizuru, an online outlier detection engine for activation data.

Result: KLLM demonstrates a 9.67x speedup, 7.03x speedup, and 229.50x, 150.21x energy efficiency improvements compared to benchmarks like A100 GPU and Atom.

Conclusion: KLLM effectively addresses key challenges in LLM inference with low-precision WAQ, showing substantial computational and energy efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its
intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization
(WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and
arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ
designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization
for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy
degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform
quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like
distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform
nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring
dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during
inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ.
Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant
model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques
introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of
WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose
KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based
computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations
on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and
full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier
detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and
smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x,
7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the
A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

*Ridvan Yesiloglu,Wei Peng,Md Tauhidul Islam,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAR is a novel model using generative autoregressive transformers for brain aging simulation, achieving superior results over existing models like GANs and LDMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to overcome challenges in predicting brain structural evolution from MRI scans, such as high data dimensionality, subtle age-related changes, and individual variability.

Method: NeuroAR uses concatenated token embeddings and cross-attention to autoregressively synthesize future brain scans, leveraging both previous MRI scans and target age information.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to latent diffusion models and GANs, validated by improved image fidelity and consistent aging patterns.

Conclusion: NeuroAR is effective in predicting subject-specific brain aging with high fidelity, outperforming existing models in its ability to synthesize realistic brain aging trajectories.

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical
and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural
evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable
insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle
changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute
challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges,
we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative
autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by
autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a
convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future
scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's
previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block
via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population
and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over
state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and
generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and
realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns.
NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its
ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenges in detecting instances of LLM-assisted cheating, focusing on language-specific attributes, cognitive contexts, and varying involvement levels.

Method: 69 participants undertook tasks based on Bloom's Taxonomy producing bona fide writing, paraphrasing, and transcribing outputs. Temporal and rhythmic keystroke features were analyzed using classifiers in cognition-aware and cognition-unaware settings.

Result: Temporal features excelled in cognition-aware contexts, while rhythmic features performed better across contexts. Detection was easiest for bona fide and transcribed responses, and models significantly outperformed human evaluators.

Conclusion: Keystroke dynamics are effective in identifying LLM-assisted writing under diverse cognitive demands and creative strategies, advancing reliable detection methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted
cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language
coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our
proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under
three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and
transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined
in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and
create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate
multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings.
Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios,
while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios.
Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than
paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the
models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that
keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across
varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and
transcribing LLM-generated responses.

*Peter Sharpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel NaN-propagation method for detecting sparsity in black-box functions, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of gradient-based optimization workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing finite-difference methods for sparsity detection often fail due to false negatives caused by coincidental zero gradients, leading to errors in gradient calculations that are hard to diagnose.

Method: The NaN-propagation technique contaminates inputs with IEEE 754 NaN values and tracks which outputs also become NaN, enabling reconstruction of conservative sparsity patterns without false negatives.

Result: The technique was tested on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x computational speedup and detecting dozens of dependencies that existing methods missed.

Conclusion: NaN-propagation effectively eliminates false negatives in sparsity detection, improves computational speed, and works across programming languages, math libraries, and black-box codes, making it practically applicable to various engineering workflows.

Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational
speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but
existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to
coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt
gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce
NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE
754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies
through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating
inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs
conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate
the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while
detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a
significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many
optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work
across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing
black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable
faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity
detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate
challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of MLPs, such as poor interpretability and difficulty with localized or high-frequency features, and to document the growing shift towards KANs in scientific machine learning.

Method: The review categorizes and evaluates the progress in KAN-based models from three perspectives: data-driven learning, physics-informed modeling, and deep operator learning, while benchmarking their performance against MLPs.

Result: KANs consistently outperform MLPs in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, showcasing their superiority in capturing complex nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: While KANs demonstrate notable advantages over MLPs, challenges remain in terms of computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees, and scalability, necessitating focused research to overcome these issues and advance the methodology.

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of
MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and
difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these
issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient
modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the
constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review
categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct
perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and
(iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of
architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and
comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs
against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence,
and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex
dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies
critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development,
particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees,
hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future
research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and
physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in sequence modeling, such as bugs in streaming and parallel sequence processing, and provides a unified framework for easier creation of production-scale models.

Method: The approach involves defining layers with explicit time-state representations and incorporating step methods to ensure identical results for streaming and layer-wise invocation.

Result: The proposed API/library streamlines the creation of both streamable and production-scale models, providing a wide range of composable layers and combinators, while achieving strong correctness guarantees.

Conclusion: SequenceLayers offers a robust solution for sequence modeling with implementations in JAX and TensorFlow 2 and ensures streamability, correctness, and simplicity in production-scale model building.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,
designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both
layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,
autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit
representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a
convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that
state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.
This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to
be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in
both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any
deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a
comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of
production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving
strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers
(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-hazard forecasting framework using sequential deep learning and Explainable AI tailored for agriculture, demonstrating strong prediction accuracy and explainable insights for comprehensive risk management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate extremes, exacerbated by climate change, pose growing threats to agriculture. There's a pressing need for intelligent multi-hazard early warning systems that can adapt to changing climate patterns and capture interactions among concurrent climatic events.

Method: The framework combines sequential deep learning models (e.g., BiLSTM) with advanced explainable AI techniques, particularly TimeSHAP, to analyze time-series meteorological data from four U.S. agricultural regions (2010–2023). Tailored models were developed for six severe weather types (cold, floods, frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall).

Result: The proposed framework achieved high predictive accuracy, especially with BiLSTM, and provided detailed temporal explanations using TimeSHAP, showing when and which climatic features significantly influence events.

Conclusion: This research improves the explainability and practical use of multi-hazard early warning systems, enabling proactive, informed decision-making in agriculture and strengthening interdisciplinary trust for managing climate risks.

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the
need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is
evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the
intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However,
traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex
interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in
this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard
forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize
meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United
States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our
framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods,
frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area.
The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a
recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal
explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but
precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive
accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's
capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research
significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard
EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process
for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

*Abdelrhman Gaber,Hassan Abd-Eltawab,John Elgallab,Youssif Abuzied,Dineo Mpanya,Turgay Celik,Swarun Kumar,Tamer ElBatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FedCVD++, a federated learning framework for coronary heart disease prediction using both parametric and non-parametric models. It addresses challenges like communication overhead, feature extraction, and class imbalance while delivering superior accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the growing health challenge of cardiovascular diseases causing millions of deaths annually by developing a privacy-preserving system for accurate coronary heart disease prediction across institutions.

Method: FedCVD++ integrates models like XGBoost, Random Forest, logistic regression, and neural networks under a federated learning approach. Key innovations include tree-subset sampling, XGBoost feature extraction, and federated SMOTE synchronization.

Result: FedCVD++ demonstrates state-of-the-art predictive performance, with federated models either surpassing or matching centralized benchmarks. The framework reduces communication costs by 3.2x while preserving accuracy, achieving high F1-scores up to 15% better than existing FL frameworks.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the integration of non-parametric models in federated health systems, proving its effectiveness and feasibility for multi-institutional deployment while addressing clinical privacy and scalability needs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually
worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive
systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework
that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural
networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart
disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1)
tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%,
(2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles,
and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class
imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves
state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its
centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81)
matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient
strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher
F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This
work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into
federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated
under real-world clinical constraints.

### [200] [Planning for Cooler Cities: A Multimodal AI Framework for Predicting and Mitigating Urban Heat Stress through Urban Landscape Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23000)
*Shengao Yi,Xiaojiang Li,Wei Tu,Tianhong Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSM-UTCI, a deep learning model to predict hyperlocal heat stress metrics for cities using high-resolution data, offering scalable urban climate planning tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cities are struggling with increasing heat stress due to climate change and urbanization. Existing physical models are computationally intensive, hindering scalability for urban planning.

Method: Introduced GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning architecture. It combines land surface morphology, high-res land cover data, and atmospheric conditions, conditioned via FiLM architecture. The model is trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI datasets.

Result: GSM-UTCI achieves high prediction accuracy (R2: 0.9151, MAE: 0.41°C) and drastically reduces inference time from hours to minutes for city-wide assessments. Simulated urban greening scenarios showed significant cooling benefits, especially with tree canopy replacement.

Conclusion: GSM-UTCI offers a scalable, accurate, and fast decision tool for urban climate planning, facilitating scenario-based evaluations to inform climate adaptation strategies.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,
cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While
traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed
assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit
scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a
multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average
Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The
model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and
hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric
context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical
accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C,
while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire
city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate
systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare
earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially
heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree
conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average
change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further
reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover
proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,
fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling
scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban
environments.

*Tom Sühr,Florian E. Dorner,Olawale Salaudeen,Augustin Kelava,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the misuse of human psychological and cognitive tests in evaluating AI systems like LLMs, arguing for the creation of AI-specific evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) using human tests are ill-suited as these tests are designed for humans and lack validity when applied to AI systems.

Method: The authors critically assess the ontological errors and methodological issues in applying human-based tests to AI, suggesting a shift towards developing AI-specific evaluation frameworks.

Result: The paper finds that human psychological tests cannot reliably measure AI traits due to issues like cultural bias, data contamination, and sensitivity to prompts.

Conclusion: The authors recommend stopping the use of human-based tests for AI evaluation and advocate for creating principled, AI-specific testing frameworks to better assess AI capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of
standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and
psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results
are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs,
this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error.
Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement
instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to
non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what
is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on
benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known
issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to
superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as
measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical
justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests,
Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of
principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such
frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating
psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the
unique context of AI.

### [202] [Directional Ensemble Aggregation for Actor-Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23501)
*Nicklas Werge,Yi-Shan Wu,Bahareh Tasdighi,Melih Kandemir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DEA, a novel method for adaptively aggregating Q-value estimates in off-policy reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aggregation methods for Q-value ensembles in reinforcement learning are often coarse and inflexible, leading to inefficiencies in different tasks and learning phases.

Method: Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA) introduces learnable parameters to adjust critic-side conservatism and actor-side exploration based on ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors.

Result: DEA was evaluated across continuous control benchmarks, showcasing improved performance over traditional static aggregation strategies.

Conclusion: DEA effectively tailors Q-value aggregation dynamically, enhancing task adaptability and robustness in reinforcement learning scenarios.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends
critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over
ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate
overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable
information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or
different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA),
an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in
actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional
parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides
actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble
disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the
direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA
to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting
aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate
DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from
interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static
ensemble strategies.

*Siwoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the limitations of multimodal latent spaces in performing inverse tasks, such as inferring input from desired outputs, across Text-Image and Text-Audio modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the largely unexplored inverse capabilities of task-specific AI models, and identifying whether multimodal latent spaces can support meaningful and coherent inverse mappings.

Method: An optimization-based framework is applied to infer input characteristics from desired outputs across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.

Result: Experimental results show that forcing models to perform inverse tasks can work textually but leads to chaotic and incoherent perceptual quality. Reconstructed latent embeddings lack semantic interpretability.

Conclusion: Multimodal latent spaces, while effective for forward tasks, are poorly structured for robust and interpretable inverse mappings, signaling the need for enhancements in their semantic richness and invertibility.

Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of
multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence)
models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,
text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for
inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based
framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it
bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio
(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models
towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently
support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.
Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that
while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually
with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image
captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized
audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and
incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input
from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently
lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,
primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the
structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work
underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically
rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

*Fernando Martínez-García,Álvaro Rubio-García,Samuel Fernández-Lorenzo,Juan José García-Ripoll,Diego Porras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SA-FDR introduces a novel $\ell_0$-norm feature selection algorithm using simulated annealing and Fisher discriminant ratio for optimizing feature subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting minimal yet informative feature subsets in high-dimensional datasets while maintaining interpretability and performance.

Method: The approach models feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem solved using simulated annealing guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio, enabling efficient exploration of the feature subset space.

Result: The algorithm selects compact feature sets with high predictive accuracy, outperforming greedy optimization approaches by capturing inter-feature dependencies.

Conclusion: SA-FDR provides an effective and flexible method for interpretable and sparse model design in high-dimensional classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection
that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it
by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of
feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio,
which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in
classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to
hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that
SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high
predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of
features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often
missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a
flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in
high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability,
and performance are crucial.

*Aurélie Leribaux,Rafael Oyamada,Johannes De Smedt,Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,Artem Polyvyanyy,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an actor-centric method using Granger causality and time-series analysis to explore how actor behaviors influence process outcomes, with a specific focus on throughput time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process mining lacks temporal and causal dynamics insights into how individual actor behaviors and interactions shape process performance.

Method: The authors integrate actor behavior analysis with Granger causality, apply it to real-world event logs for actor interactions (e.g., continuation, interuption, handovers), and use Group Lasso for lag selection in time-series data.

Result: They find a small set of influential lags that explain the majority of causal influences, showing actor behavior has measurable impacts on throughput time and process performance.

Conclusion: Actor-centric, time-series approaches uncover temporal dependencies and provide deeper insights into individual actor impacts on process efficiency.

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical
aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static
process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from
individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the
complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and
interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we
address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality
to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to
realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e.
continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group
Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set
of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor
behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly
throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric,
time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive
process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual
behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

*Junyi Fan,Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Yong Si,Minoo Ahmadi,Greg Placencia,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning model that accurately predicts vancomycin-related kidney injury in ICU patients using routine data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is critical in ICU settings, as it poses significant risks to critically ill patients.

Method: The study developed a predictive model by analyzing ICU data of 10,288 patients using feature selection methods and testing six machine learning algorithms, with interpretability enhanced through SHAP, ALE, and Bayesian sampling.

Result: The CatBoost algorithm emerged as the best-performing model with an AUROC of 0.818, identifying phosphate and others as key predictors of kidney injury.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates robust prediction accuracy and interpretability, potentially aiding timely medical interventions for critically ill patients on vancomycin.

Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections
in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in
critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine
learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine
ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV
database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria
(creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were
selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six
algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was
evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior
sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation.
CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800,
specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were
phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP
confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns.
Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%)
in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated
creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and
interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely
interventions in critical care.

TL;DR: This study explores local differential privacy in thresholding bandit problems, proposing privacy-preserving algorithms and analyzing their theoretical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for privacy in decision-making processes within the context of bandit problems, specifically to protect sensitive responses via local differential privacy.

Method: A Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism is introduced to obtain private responses, alongside algorithms tailored for fixed budget and fixed confidence settings.

Result: The algorithms deliver strong privacy guarantees and match theoretical lower performance bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Lower bounds on additional privacy-related losses are explored.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer insights into creating effective privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems, meeting theoretical expectations on performance loss.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of ensuring local differential privacy in
the thresholding bandit problem. We consider both the fixed budget and fixed
confidence settings. We propose methods that utilize private responses,
obtained through a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism, to
identify arms with expected rewards exceeding a predefined threshold. We show
that this procedure provides strong privacy guarantees and derive theoretical
performance bounds on the proposed algorithms. Additionally, we present general
lower bounds that characterize the additional loss incurred by any
differentially private mechanism, and show that the presented algorithms match
these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. Our results provide valuable
insights into privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a transformer-based foundation model for fracture prediction that generalizes across materials, geometries, and loading conditions, offering a unified and scalable alternative to simulator-specific workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fracture prediction is critical for designing reliable systems, but current methods (ML or physics-based simulators) face challenges in robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces a transformer-based architecture with multimodal inputs, integrating structured/unstructured meshes and text embeddings of input decks. The model operates across materials, geometries, and simulators without requiring modifications.

Result: The trained model generalizes well, even for unseen materials like titanium and concrete, requiring minimal data. It outperforms standard ML in data efficiency and adapts to diverse tasks like time-to-failure estimation and fracture evolution modeling.

Conclusion: This unified model demonstrates a scalable, adaptable approach to fracture prediction, reducing data needs and combining insights from simulation and machine learning effectively.

Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing
safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that
operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across
the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world
applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are
trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize.
Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are
fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance
computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations,
we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a
transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of
materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and
tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured
and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of
textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and
solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation
across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The
trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks,
including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting
to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to
unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single
sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results
show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture,
offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the performance and energy trade-offs of AI inference tasks across various edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deployment of AI-enabled applications on resource-constrained edge devices requires understanding their performance and energy usage, critical for latency-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The study characterizes the performance of traditional neural networks and large language models across diverse edge devices, focusing on model F1 score, inference time, inference power, and memory usage.

Result: Findings reveal trade-offs among model performance and hardware resource usage, offering insights for optimizing edge AI deployments.

Conclusion: Optimizing hardware, frameworks, and AI model parameters can balance performance and resource efficiency for practical edge AI applications.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge
AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries)
combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge.
Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical
applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge
devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge
applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural
Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU).
Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study
on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the
device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study
fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional,
neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices.
Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time,
inference power, and memory usage. Hardware and framework optimization, along
with external parameter tuning of AI models, can balance between model
performance and resource usage to realize practical edge AI deployments.

*Richard Williams,Eric Nalisnick,Andrew Holbrook*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiGG-E is an autoregressive model designed to learn and generate weighted graphs efficiently, showcasing strengths in capturing distributions and computational scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many applications in various scientific fields require models for weighted graphs, but existing options are limited in handling joint distributions of graph topology and edge weights effectively.

Method: BiGG-E extends the BiGG model to incorporate edge weights, uses an autoregressive approach, exploits sparsity, and ensures efficient generation with $O((n + m)\log n)$ computational complexity.

Result: Experimental results and simulation studies highlight that BiGG-E surpasses existing benchmarks for capturing distributions of weighted graphs while maintaining scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: BiGG-E successfully addresses the challenges in modeling weighted graph distributions, offering a practical and efficient solution suitable for diverse applications.

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social
sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted
graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative
models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to
weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a
joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over
weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the
edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an
autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that
learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting
sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n +
m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark
datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted
graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

*Qilin Zhou,Haipeng Wang,Zhengyuan Wei,W. K. Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CostCert, a scalable approach to defend against adversarial patch attacks, specifically enabling precise certified recovery for top-k predictions without pairwise comparisons or combinatorial issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing certified recovery techniques struggle to guarantee the true label within top-k predictions due to vote inflation caused by adversarial attackers, making precise certification challenging.

Method: CostCert uses a novel verification design that evaluates whether the attacker's budget is insufficient to exclude true labels from top-k predictions based on uncontrollable votes, avoiding pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion.

Result: CostCert achieves significant performance improvements over PatchGuard, demonstrating up to 57.3% certified accuracy under large attack conditions (patch size 96), while PatchGuard's certified accuracy drops to zero.

Conclusion: CostCert offers a more scalable and precise defense mechanism against adversarial patch attacks, addressing limitations of prior methods and improving certified recovery for deep learning systems.

Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for
defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep
learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the
sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if
applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those
votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k
prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes
controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all
combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion
problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based
certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample
within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial
explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is
infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes
uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k
prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the
current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in
certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already
dropped to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of biased and degraded model performance in federated learning caused by missing data, stemming from users opting not to share data and device-related stragglers.

Method: The authors propose FLOSS, a system that mitigates the impact of missing data by addressing the dual challenges of stragglers and user opt-out in federated learning systems.

Result: FLOSS was empirically tested in simulations and showed improved handling of data deficiencies, mitigating the negative impacts on federated learning performance.

Conclusion: FLOSS successfully addresses the problem of missing data in federated learning systems, showcasing its viability as a solution in scenarios with user opt-outs and stragglers.

Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on
privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share
their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower
users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When
combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the
result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and
degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that
mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the
presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its
performance in simulations.

Method: The paper benchmarks multiple neural architectures using datasets with various evaluation conditions and introduces the Fairness (F) and Robustness (R) metrics to quantify accuracy and convergence under noise.

Result: Noise-aware training improves robustness in certain configurations, providing insights into the potential of noise-based augmentation in speech models.

Conclusion: Noise-aware training can enhance OOD robustness for keyword classifiers in specific scenarios, but there are limitations to this approach.

Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such
relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we
investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness
and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD
conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of
evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use
of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to
a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID
and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves
robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the
benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in
speech models.

*Erin George,Deanna Needell,Berk Ustun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the arbitrariness in probabilistic classification tasks caused by observational multiplicity, introduces a regret-based evaluation method, and discusses its applications in promoting safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and addressing the arbitrariness in models' predictions, which undermines interpretability and safety, particularly when different models result in conflicting predictions.

Method: The paper introduces a regret-based metric to evaluate changes in probabilistic classification predictions when subjected to different training labels. A general-purpose method is presented to estimate this regret.

Result: The regret measure highlights higher arbitrariness for certain groups in datasets and showcases its utility in promoting safety through abstention and enhanced data collection.

Conclusion: The proposed regret framework provides a useful tool for understanding arbitrariness in probabilistic classifications and demonstrates potential in improving safety and fairness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost
equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety
when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this
work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification
tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}.
We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications
where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are
given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the
arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of
\emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic
classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could
change as a result of different training labels change. We present a
general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification
task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in
the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how
estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and
data collection.

*Xiangshu Gong,Zhiqiang Xie,Xiaowei Jin,Chen Wang,Yanling Qu,Wangmeng Zuo,Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel AI paradigm to tackle differential equations (DEs) effectively by addressing limitations in high-frequency components and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide an efficient and accurate AI-based method for solving differential equations that suffer from approximation in high-frequency components and challenges due to limited data.

Method: It combines a first-principles data generation approach with a scale-dilation operator (SDO) and a specialized Transformer AI model. The SDO is used to process solutions in the frequency domain for smoother optimization.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior accuracy in solving diverse DEs compared to state-of-the-art techniques and can generate extensive training datasets with low computational costs.

Conclusion: The approach broadens the usability and reliability of AI solvers for differential equations across various applications in natural and engineering domains.

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial
intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce
and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency
components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including
DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation
operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we
generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources
and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing
arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at
extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages
the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a
spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with
SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is
proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient,
revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC
with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI
paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and
engineering fields.

*Sofiane Bouaziz,Adel Hafiane,Raphael Canals,Rachid Nedjai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents FuseTen, a method to produce daily high-resolution Land Surface Temperature data by combining data from different satellite sources, overcoming resolution limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation require precise monitoring tools, yet satellite data face constraints in balancing spatial and temporal resolution needed to study Land Surface Temperature.

Method: FuseTen uses a generative model with averaging-based supervision grounded in physics, attention mechanisms, normalization modules, and a PatchGAN discriminator to generate fine-resolution daily LST data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate FuseTen achieves a 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% enhancement in visual fidelity over traditional linear methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses satellite limitations, offering the first non-linear framework for high spatial resolution daily LST estimation, improving monitoring of climate impacts.

Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing
challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying
them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.
One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these
phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites
and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's
surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a
novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m
spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from
Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative
architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in
physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within
the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.
Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear
baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and
31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners designing LLM services aim to optimize inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity, but no model can achieve all three simultaneously.

Method: The researchers formally analyzed and mathematically proved the inherent trade-offs among the three properties, developing the BAR Theorem as a principled framework for guiding the design of LLM applications.

Result: The study establishes that optimizing all three key properties simultaneously is impossible, providing theoretical proof and a framework for practical application design.

Conclusion: The BAR Theorem offers a structured approach to balance trade-offs, helping practitioners make informed decisions in designing LLM services.

Abstract: When designing LLM services, practitioners care about three key properties:
inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity. However,
our analysis shows that no model can simultaneously optimize for all three. We
formally prove this trade-off and propose a principled framework named The BAR
Theorem for LLM-application design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocsRay, a training-free system for understanding multimodal documents using pseudo-Table of Contents and hierarchical retrieval techniques for improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in understanding complex multimodal documents due to structural inconsistencies and limited training data.

Method: DocsRay combines three techniques: pseudo-Table of Contents generation via prompt-based LLM interactions, zero-shot multimodal analysis using unified text-centric representations, and a two-stage hierarchical retrieval system to reduce retrieval complexity.

Result: DocsRay demonstrated a 45% efficiency improvement in query latency and surpassed previous accuracy benchmarks with a score of 64.7% on MMLongBench-Doc.

Conclusion: DocsRay proves effective in improving efficiency and accuracy for multimodal document understanding, leveraging native LLM capabilities without additional training.

Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their
structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce
\textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates
pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models'
(LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse
elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized
models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines
three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM
interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal
analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric
representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an
efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval
complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents
averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency
from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the
MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%,
substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses contextual hallucinations in AI using a generator-agnostic observer model to detect hallucinated text with high accuracy by leveraging a single linear direction in residual streams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the persistent issue of contextual hallucinations in AI-generated text, which undermine reliability in applications like language models.

Method: The study employs a generator-independent observer model combined with linear probing on residual streams to isolate a direction distinguishing hallucinated from truthful text. Robust evaluations were performed on various model scales.

Result: The model consistently outperformed competitors by 5-27 points, identified late-layer MLP activity as key, and successfully manipulated hallucination rates by adjusting the identified direction.

Conclusion: The research proves the feasibility of tracking and mitigating hallucinations within low-dimensional sub-circuits of neural networks, providing actionable insights for improved generative AI systems, supported by the benchmark release ContraTales.

Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context --
remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical
interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects
hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual
stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating
hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and
showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B).
Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP
activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator
hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel
evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific
MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the
2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

### [220] [Efficient Machine Unlearning via Influence Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23257)
*Jiawei Liu,Chenwang Wu,Defu Lian,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU), a method for efficiently removing data from machine learning models, inspired by cognitive science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy concerns necessitate machine unlearning methods that allow models to forget specific training data, addressing limitations of existing influence-based approaches.

Method: The paper establishes a theoretical link between incremental learning and unlearning, proposing IAU to replace computationally heavy Hessian matrix methods with efficient gradient optimization.

Result: IAU demonstrates effectiveness in balancing data removal guarantees, efficiency, and maintaining model utility, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on various datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: IAU provides a practical solution for machine unlearning, leveraging the connection between memorization and forgetting, and outperforms existing techniques.

Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling
machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received
increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has
emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of
individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,
this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the
necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training
samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and
scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the
difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that
memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link
between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This
connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of
incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in
unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on
more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned
cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence
Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from
the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,
and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods
across diverse datasets and model architectures. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSwarm introduces dynamic graph optimization and a selector mechanism for LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS), showing improved adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS frameworks rely on static and manually-designed collaboration graphs, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness.

Method: DynaSwarm combines an actor-critic reinforcement learning model and a dynamic graph selector that uses parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning to adapt graph structures based on specific input samples.

Result: Experiments covering question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that DynaSwarm outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines consistently.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the advantage of leveraging sample-specific dynamic graph structures to enhance the performance of LLM-based MAS.

Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed
and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic
framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an
actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph
structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic
graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each
input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the
need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging
sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized
agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to
fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that
DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS
baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance
of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

*Yuetian Chen,Zhiqi Wang,Nathalie Baracaldo,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Lei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to analyze how deep learning models encode membership privacy risks dynamically throughout training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and mitigate privacy risks in deep learning model training, specifically membership inference attacks.

Method: The authors propose tracking vulnerabilities of individual samples during training using an FPR-TPR analysis to measure how different factors affect privacy leakage dynamics.

Result: They identify a strong correlation between a sample's learning difficulty and its privacy risk, showing that these risks are set early during training.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of privacy risks in training deep learning models, paving the way for proactive, privacy-aware approaches to model training.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of
training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack
methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership
information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic
analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at
the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an
FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how
factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice
influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially,
we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning
difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the
final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results
thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge
during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model
training strategies.

TL;DR: The paper addresses a gap in Next Basket Prediction by introducing methods to identify forgotten items during supermarket visits, offering interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked problem of detecting forgotten items in shopping scenarios and provide clear justifications for recommendations.

Method: Two novel interpretable-by-design algorithms tailored for identifying forgotten items are proposed.

Result: The proposed algorithms showed a 10-15% improvement over state-of-the-art NBP baselines in experiments with a real-world retail dataset.

Conclusion: Introducing forgotten item prediction enhances shopping convenience and transparency, outperforming existing methods in reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and
providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an
underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing
NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without
explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap
is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the
reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods
rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to
justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the
forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design
algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while
offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a
real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP
baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes leveraging process reward models (PRMs) to improve reinforcement learning training efficiency for large reasoning models (LRMs), addressing sparse feedback issues in traditional methods while showing enhanced problem-solving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RL approaches for training LRMs rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, leading to inefficient optimization.

Method: The authors develop a process reward model (PRM) that uses intrinsic signals to evaluate stepwise correctness and aggregates steps into coherent thought units, reducing reward ambiguity. They also introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Experiments with LRMs of 1.5B and 7B parameters reveal significantly fewer training samples needed while achieving better problem-solving accuracy compared to outcome-only reward baselines.

Conclusion: Structured process rewards can accelerate LRM optimization for math reasoning tasks, highlighting the potential of PRMs in reinforcement learning setups.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex
math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional
approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting
in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function
of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We
propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism
operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based
training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve
problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise
correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent
'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable
credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating
reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism
that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's
current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative
trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL
algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with
process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and
7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving
accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward
baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can
substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PLARE, a framework utilizing large vision-language models to provide preference-based training for robots, eliminating the need for reward-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of offline RL, particularly the costly and labor-intensive requirement for reward functions in safety-critical robotic applications.

Method: PLARE uses a vision-language model to generate preference labels from visual trajectory segment pairs based on a language task description and directly trains policies using these labels in a supervised contrastive learning framework.

Result: PLARE achieves state-of-the-art performance on robotic manipulation tasks (MetaWorld) and demonstrates efficacy in real-world robotic settings with physical robots.

Conclusion: PLARE provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to reward function design for offline RL, with strong performance both in simulations and real-world applications.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for
training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating
the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online
interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world
applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical.
However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data,
which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself
costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this
paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large
vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training.
Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM
for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a
language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these
preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective,
bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive
experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves
performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based
reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further
validating its practical applicability.

*Tatsuya Mitomi,Fumiyasu Makinoshima,Fumiya Makihara,Eigo Segawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic pricing system for bike-sharing systems to address imbalanced inventory at bike stations. It uses a differentiable agent-based simulation to optimize inventory balance and minimize costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bike-sharing systems suffer from inventory imbalances due to varying spatiotemporal user demands, leading to high relocation costs. There is a need for dynamic pricing to manage demand effectively and optimize system performance.

Method: The authors developed a differentiable agent-based simulation to design dynamic pricing policies. They validated the approach using numerical experiments and compared it against traditional methods to optimize inventory balance without manual relocation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated a 73%-78% reduction in loss, over a 100-fold increase in convergence speed, and naturally achieved balanced inventory in both small and large-scale scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic pricing approach efficiently balances bike inventories in sharing systems, minimizes discount costs, and eliminates the need for manual relocation, demonstrating its potential as a practical solution.

Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly
transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands
lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional
relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through
optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for
such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse
backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we
develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic
pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite
spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first
validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical
experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100
parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more
accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than
a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a
large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations,
resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained
pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced
inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of
discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting
appropriate initial conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding and intervention strategies for concept drift in dynamic systems, enabling prevention of model failures and physical system errors.

Method: Developing a framework for causal explanations of concept drift, evaluated against multiple use cases to identify causally relevant features.

Result: The framework successfully isolates causally relevant features affected by concept drift and facilitates effective intervention in diverse use cases.

Conclusion: Expanding drift explanations to cover causal factors significantly enhances the practical utility in addressing concept drift-related issues, enabling better system reliability.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those
changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical
infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in
the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted
interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and
errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based
drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the
actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation
strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of
our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by
concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ML-based system using honey mineral profiles to identify adulterated honey, with the random forest classifier achieving 98.37% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Honey adulteration is a common issue in food safety, necessitating an accurate and efficient detection method using ML techniques.

Method: The approach includes preprocessing (missing-value handling and normalization) and classification using three ML models: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest.

Result: Experimental findings reveal high classification accuracy in detecting honey adulteration, with random forest achieving 98.37% in cross-validation.

Conclusion: Honey mineral content serves as effective input for ML models, and the random forest is most effective for identifying adulterated honey.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based system for detecting
honey adulteration utilizing honey mineral element profiles. The proposed
system comprises two phases: preprocessing and classification. The
preprocessing phase involves the treatment of missing-value attributes and
normalization. In the classifica-tion phase, we use three supervised ML models:
logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, to dis-criminate between
authentic and adulterated honey. To evaluate the performance of the ML models,
we use a public dataset comprising measurements of mineral element content of
authentic honey, sugar syrups, and adul-terated honey. Experimental findings
show that mineral element content in honey provides robust discriminative
information for detecting honey adulteration. Results also demonstrate that the
random forest-based classifier outperforms other classifiers on this dataset,
achieving the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.37%.

*Mokhtar A. Al-Awadhi,Ratnadeep R. Deshmukh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning system leveraging infrared spectroscopy to detect adulteration in coconut milk, achieving 93.33% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for accurate and efficient detection of coconut milk adulteration for public health and quality control.

Method: A three-phase system: preprocessing spectral signals, feature extraction using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and classification using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

Result: Achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 93.33% in detecting adulterated coconut milk using FTIR spectral data.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates high effectiveness in distinguishing pure and adulterated coconut milk, providing a robust tool for food quality evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a system for detecting adulteration in coconut
milk, utilizing infrared spectroscopy. The machine learning-based proposed
system comprises three phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classification. The first phase involves removing irrelevant data from coconut
milk spectral signals. In the second phase, we employ the Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) algorithm for extracting the most discriminating features. In
the third phase, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to classify coconut
milk samples into authentic or adulterated. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system using a public dataset comprising Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) spectral information of pure and contaminated coconut milk samples.
Findings show that the proposed method successfully detects adulteration with a
cross-validation accuracy of 93.33%.

*Nodens F. Koren,Samuel Lanthaler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM) to efficiently learn time-dependent PDE solution operators by separately modeling temporal and spatial dynamics, demonstrating improved performance with fewer parameters and theoretical grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need to develop efficient and generalizable models for learning solution operators for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), which are foundational in numerous scientific and engineering applications.

Method: The proposed method, ST-SSM, factorizes spatial and temporal dimensions using structured state-space models. Temporal evolution and spatial interactions are modeled independently, and a unified universality theorem is established for this architecture.

Result: ST-SSM outperformed alternative schemes like zigzag scanning on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers', 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. It achieved competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and showed enhanced results under partial observability due to its temporal memory.

Conclusion: Dimensionally factorized operator learning, as demonstrated by ST-SSM, is an efficient approach for PDE modeling that strikes a balance between parameter efficiency and generalization. The approach is further bolstered by theoretical insights and empirical validation.

Abstract: We propose the Spatiotemporal State Space Neural Operator (ST-SSM), a compact
architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs). ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the
spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to
independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design
enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal
dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural
operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class
of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation
outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel
independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers'
equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations
under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with
existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our
results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by
showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight
the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and
generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical
footing.

*Yinhui Ma,Tomomasa Yamasaki,Zhehui Wang,Tao Luo,Bo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Coflex, a novel hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) approach that uses Sparse Gaussian Processes and Bayesian optimization to enhance performance and reduce computational overhead efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerators for edge hardware faces challenges due to the extensive search space and high computational cost of HW-NAS.

Method: The paper introduces Coflex, which integrates Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian optimization. The use of sparse inducing points reduces computational complexity and allows scalable analysis of large search spaces.

Result: Coflex achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods, with improved network accuracy, better Energy-Delay-Product metrics, and computational speed-ups between 1.9x to 9.5x.

Conclusion: Coflex effectively balances performance optimization and computational efficiency, making it advantageous for edge-based DNN accelerator design.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach
to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy
efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural
Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high
computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To
address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that
integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian
optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP
kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of
training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables
scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing
computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate
the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on
accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and
Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from

*Shervin Rahimzadeh Arashloo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel manifold-regularised $
\ell_p$-SVDD method with a signature kernel for enhanced time series anomaly detection, leveraging data geometry and structural information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for anomaly detection in time series lack effective utilization of structural and geometric information in data distributions, which the proposed method aims to address.

Method: The approach integrates manifold regularisation into $
\ell_p$-SVDD to encourage label smoothness on data manifolds, and employs a signature kernel to handle time series complexities, with optimization guided by a Representer theorem.

Result: Theoretical analysis using Rademacher complexities shows strong potential for generalization, and empirical evaluations across benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances anomaly detection in time series by combining manifold regularisation and signature kernels, providing both theoretical insights and experimental validation.

Abstract: We generalise the recently introduced large-margin $\ell_p$-SVDD approach to
exploit the geometry of data distribution via manifold regularising and a
signature kernel representation for time series anomaly detection.
Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD
method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture
structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an
existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation
technique for the proposed method and show that it can benefit from the
signature kernel to capture time series complexities for anomaly detection.
  We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to
analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental
assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its
performance against other methods.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the prediction of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients using various machine learning techniques and highlights the effectiveness of the extra survival trees (EST) model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide accurate predictions of all-cause mortality risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients to enhance personalized treatment strategies.

Method: The study analyzed a cohort of 554 T2DM patients over 16.8 years, identified key survival-related features, and trained multiple machine learning models. The extra survival trees (EST) model, combined with SHAP for interpretability, was identified as the best-performing model.

Result: The EST model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776 and outstanding AUC values for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year mortality predictions, effectively identifying high-risk patients.

Conclusion: The model is highly effective for mortality risk prediction and can be implemented in clinical settings due to its strong performance and interpretability, enabling better treatment optimization.

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent
non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.
Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for
personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods.
This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed
T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients
(36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple
machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause
mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive
explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The
extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated
the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776,
with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of
0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause
mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to
interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The
developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk
assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside
application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting
timely treatment optimization.

### [234] [Incorporating structural uncertainty in causal decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23495)
*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the significance of structural uncertainty in causal inference and proposes Bayesian model averaging as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify that structural uncertainty in causal inference is frequently ignored by practitioners, which can lead to suboptimal decisions when estimating causal effects.

Method: The paper adopts a theoretical framework and simulations to establish when structural uncertainty warrants Bayesian model averaging in bivariate causal relationships.

Result: It finds that model averaging is particularly valuable under conditions of moderate to high structural uncertainty, substantial differences in effects between structures, and sensitive loss functions.

Conclusion: The paper offers a complementary approach to robust causal inference, emphasizing the importance of addressing structural uncertainty for better decision-making.

Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore
structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential
enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over
competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X
\rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is
beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal
effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are
sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality
results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions
and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can
provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements
existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of
uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

### [235] [A Verifier Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23504)
*Maurits Kaptein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between certificate length and verifier runtime, presenting a theorem on trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between verifier runtime and certificate length in computational complexity analysis.

Method: Theoretically establishes a Verifier Trade-off Theorem to quantify the relationship and applies it to complexity class separations and specific problems.

Result: Proves that reducing verification time necessitates certificates of significant length, and explores its implications for complexity classes and specific computational problems.

Conclusion: The work highlights key trade-offs in verification, contributes to complexity theory, and provides insights into problems like P vs. NP.

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime.
We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent
verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge
g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\).
This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We
demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between
complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural
problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we
provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the
existence of sub-linear certificates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, offering a high-probability convergence analysis under heavy-tailed noise. Results indicate better trade-offs between convergence speed and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incompatibility between existing high-probability convergence methods requiring adaptive clipping thresholds and the need for fixed clipping in Differential Privacy mechanisms.

Method: The authors develop a high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping threshold, applicable for both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under bounded heavy-tailed noise.

Result: The method achieves convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution at a faster rate and allows balancing between convergence and privacy trade-offs.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between optimization convergence and Differential Privacy requirements, offering improved performance under specific heavy-tailed noise settings.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the
high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD,
AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large
language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP)
mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically
require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization
steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian
mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first
high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping
level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under
heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment
assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping
level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a
faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against
the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence
speed and privacy guarantees.

### [237] [Continual Learning with Synthetic Boundary Experience Blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23534)
*Chih-Fan Hsu,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new continual learning framework, Experience Blending, that reduces forgetting by using synthetic boundary data (SBD) generated with Differential Privacy (DP) noise. Results show significant accuracy improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, which arises from sparse key samples leading to simplified decision boundaries.

Method: The method employs a multivariate DP noise mechanism to create synthetic boundary data near decision boundaries and combines it with stored key samples for end-to-end training.

Result: Their framework outperformed nine continual learning baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, with accuracy gains of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Conclusion: Integrating synthetic boundary data through Experience Blending effectively stabilizes decision boundaries and reduces forgetting, marking a notable advancement in continual learning techniques.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models
trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown
promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of
stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We
hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary
(Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit
regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To
validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf
Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples
and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core
components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that
injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations,
generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages
both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines,
achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks and evaluates PEFT methods on convolutional architectures for resource-constrained edge deployments, finding them memory-inefficient for depthwise convolutional architectures but highly effective in reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the underexplored application of PEFT methods on smaller convolutional models, commonly used in edge devices.

Method: Benchmarked and analyzed PEFT methods LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore on standard and depthwise convolutional architectures using PyTorch profilers, focusing on memory and computational efficiency during fine-tuning.

Result: PEFT methods are half as memory-efficient in depthwise-separable convolutional architectures compared with their use in LLMs, but can reduce FLOPs during updates on edge-targeted convolutional architectures by up to 95%.

Conclusion: Adapter-based PEFT methods can significantly improve computational efficiency for convolutional models in edge environments while facing trade-offs in memory efficiency, offering practical guidance for hardware-constrained applications.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs
of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional
parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively
researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models
used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains
underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on
convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge
environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and
depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and
accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to
compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT
methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in
mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We
find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when
applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their
efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures
optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating
point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights
offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware
constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is

*Piotr Indyk,Michael Kapralov,Kshiteej Sheth,Tal Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a fast algorithm for matrix-vector multiplication with asymmetric Gaussian Kernel matrices, useful for attention computation in large language models, achieving subquadratic runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for faster matrix-vector operations in high-dimensional settings, particularly for attention matrices in large language models, is the driving force behind the research.

Method: An algorithm was developed based on the observation that the sum of entries in Gaussian kernel matrices scales linearly with matrix size in practice, bypassing worst-case quadratic scaling.

Result: Validated the scalability assumption experimentally, developed a subquadratic-time algorithm, and successfully computed products for unrestricted vectors.

Conclusion: This research establishes a new computational approach for Gaussian kernel matrices, providing efficiency benefits for practical applications in attention mechanisms and other domains.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study
fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian
Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a
set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$
queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} =
e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given
a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to
output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in
time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the
following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries
of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We
validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices
encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We
obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption,
for unrestricted vectors.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphRAG-R1, a framework that enhances Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for multi-hop reasoning by incorporating adaptive retrieval and reasoning mechanisms using reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GraphRAG methods struggle with multi-hop reasoning required for complex problems due to reliance on pre-defined heuristics and underutilization of LLMs' reasoning potentials.

Method: Proposed an adaptive framework using process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning, featuring modified Group Relative Policy Optimization, process-constrained rewards (PRA for retrieval and CAF for performance-cost balance), a phase-dependent training strategy, and hybrid graph-textual retrieval.

Result: Extensive experiments proved that GraphRAG-R1 outperforms existing GraphRAG methods in solving complex reasoning tasks across different datasets.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-R1 effectively enhances multi-hop reasoning capabilities in language models and can be integrated with various retrieval methods for improved performance.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for
knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships.
However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when
handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and
retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully
utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose
GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with
process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems,
autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and
perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking
capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle
the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation
(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the
over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the
model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent
training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start
and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual
retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex
reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be
flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently
delivering performance improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EB-gMCR, a deep learning-based method for signal unmixing reformulated as a generative process, showing high accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability and reliability issues in classical matrix factorization-based methods for multivariate curve resolution, especially as component counts increase.

Method: The authors developed EB-gMCR, an energy-based deep learning approach using a differentiable gating network to identify and retain active components from a candidate pool.

Result: EB-gMCR achieved high accuracy (R^2 ≥ 0.98) on noisy synthetic datasets with up to 256 latent sources, recovering component counts within 5% of the ground truth.

Conclusion: EB-gMCR offers scalable signal unmixing with adaptability to diverse scenarios, leveraging generative modeling combined with hard component selection for chemical analysis.

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely
applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution
(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base
patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in
understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix
factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually
unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the
scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This
study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an
energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the
smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts
from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable
gating network to retain only active components while estimating their
concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent
sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count
within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near
exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity
or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to
other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By
uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR
offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including
chemical library-driven scenarios. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning by proposing a novel methodology combining hierarchical reinforcement learning and communication among agents to improve coordination and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like partial observability and non-stationarity in multi-agent systems limit decentralized MARL methods. Introducing coordination and planning mechanisms can overcome these obstacles, but their combination with hierarchical policies remains unexplored.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical graph structure where agents communicate via message-passing. They utilize the feudal hierarchical reinforcement learning framework paired with a novel reward-assignment strategy based on advantage function optimization.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in multi-agent coordination tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating hierarchical HRL and communication effectively addresses MARL challenges and improves performance, contributing a scalable solution for multi-agent coordination and planning.

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for
learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability
and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing
mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically,
coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication
(e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL)
approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the
applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the
combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void,
we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent
hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and
rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among
agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper
levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To
learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment
method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage
function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show
that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning model that integrates pre-trained language models and attention mechanisms to predict patient enrollment in clinical trials, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting patient enrollment is crucial for the success of clinical trials, given the significant financial and operational costs associated with them.

Method: The authors develop a neural network model that combines pre-trained language models for processing clinical documents, tabular feature encoding, an attention mechanism, and a probabilistic Gamma distribution layer for range estimation.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance in predicting patient enrollment at clinical trial sites compared to established baseline models on real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective and innovative approach to addressing the challenges of enrollment prediction in clinical trials, offering better accuracy and accounting for uncertainties.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy
of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands
significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need
for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient
enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges
during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural
network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the
complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into
expressive representations. These representations are then combined with
encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for
uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a
probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range
estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration,
assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out
extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the
proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a
number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve data augmentation techniques for time series analysis tasks like forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection, addressing the need for reliable and controllable synthetic data generation.

Method: The method employs a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder to apply controlled transformations in the latent space, allowing the generation of diverse and complex synthetic time series data.

Result: Experiments using real-world datasets showed that L-GTA produces augmented data with improved reliability, consistency, and controllability, enhancing predictive accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct data transformation methods.

Conclusion: L-GTA is an effective approach for augmenting time series datasets, demonstrating significant benefits in data reliability and predictive capabilities.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series
analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We
introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a
generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent
autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space
of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties
of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse
transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and
combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time
series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the
ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable
augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive
accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

### [246] [On the Expressiveness of Softmax Attention: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23632)
*Gabriel Mongaras,Eric C. Larson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Softmax attention underpins transformer models due to its high expressiveness, but suffers from quadratic complexity, unlike linear attention which sacrifices accuracy to avoid this bottleneck. The paper derives a recurrent form to describe softmax attention as an RNN, enabling deeper component-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the unexplained accuracy gap between softmax attention methods and more computationally efficient linear attention methods.

Method: By deriving a recurrent formulation of softmax attention, the authors compare its components to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and conduct component-level analysis to assess their contributions.

Result: Softmax attention is shown to have a recurrent structure, offering insights into its higher expressiveness compared to linear attention.

Conclusion: The work enhances understanding of softmax attention by identifying component interactions responsible for its superior performance.

Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern
transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a
wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the
quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the
sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and
similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of
softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from
the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream
accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and
key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other
nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains
unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of
softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using
this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows
for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the
importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps
explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient
updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE
reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency
ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module
for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data

performance against diverse attack patterns through our adaptive learning
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods like SHAP are useful for understanding models but underutilized for optimizing them. The study explores their potential in regularization to improve model performance and explainability.

Method: The authors utilized entropy-based penalties to shape feature attributions, promoting sparsity and stability. This method applies to tree-based models, specifically using TreeSHAP.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate improved generalization, stability, and interpretable feature attributions for both regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SHAP-guided regularization modernizes machine learning practices by combining explainability with improved predictive accuracy, making models more reliable.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have
become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in
guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a
SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance
constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage
sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across
samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification
tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model
regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves
generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature
attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven
regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and
more reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize Large Language Models' efficiency by addressing challenges in caching responses, such as personalization and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search.

Method: A lightweight LLM, deployed in a dynamic routing architecture called TweakLLM, enables the adjustment of cached responses to fit incoming prompts.

Result: TweakLLM matches the quality of advanced models while improving caching efficiency, as validated through user studies and multi-agent debates.

Conclusion: TweakLLM provides a scalable and efficient caching method for large-scale LLMs, achieving cost and latency benefits without sacrificing user satisfaction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making
efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and
latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach
proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the
limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present
TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to
dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive
evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction
voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM
maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly
improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight
TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM
deployments without compromising user experience.

*Tianyi Chen,Haitong Ma,Na Li,Kai Wang,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm enabling efficient 1-step sampling, improving the responsiveness over traditional diffusion policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the slow iterative sampling process of diffusion policy models in online RL, which hinders their responsiveness.

Method: The authors propose FPMD, leveraging the connection between distribution variance and the discretization error in interpolation flow matching models, without requiring extra distillation or consistency training. Two variants, flow policy and MeanFlow policy, are introduced.

Result: The paper shows that FPMD achieves performance comparable to diffusion policy baselines while drastically reducing function evaluations during inference by hundreds of times.

Conclusion: FPMD provides a highly efficient alternative to traditional diffusion policies, maintaining strong performance with significantly improved inference speed.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement
learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference
of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which
limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow
Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step
sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical
connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of
single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and
requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two
algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations,
respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate
that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy
baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during
inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DepMicroDiff, a novel framework, integrates diffusion-based generative models, Dependency-Aware Transformers (DAT), VAE-based pretraining, and LLM-encoded metadata to achieve superior microbiome data imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing microbiome imputation methods which fail to address data sparsity, noise, and complex interdependencies between microbial taxa, as well as ignoring context-specific metadata.

Method: Developed DepMicroDiff using a combination of diffusion-based models, Dependency-Aware Transformers, VAE-based pretraining, and patient metadata conditioning through large language models.

Result: DepMicroDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in microbiome dataset imputation, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE & MAE across multiple cancer types.

Conclusion: DepMicroDiff demonstrates robustness and generalizability for microbiome imputation, making it a valuable tool for advancing biomarker discovery and related applications in healthcare.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and
disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate
imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing
imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to
capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook
contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a
novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a
Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise
dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced
by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on
patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA
microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712),
cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer
types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome
imputation.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the utility of anomalous samples in anomaly detection and classification by introducing a multi-score methodology combining Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. It shows effectiveness on industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous data is typically deemed harder to acquire compared to normal samples, raising challenges in few-shot learning settings where limited data might significantly impact performance.

Method: The authors propose a multi-score anomaly detection methodology that integrates anomalous samples using Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. Additionally, they develop an augmentation-based validation technique to optimize score aggregation.

Result: The approach demonstrated effectiveness when evaluated on popular industrial anomaly detection datasets, showcasing the benefits and limitations of incorporating anomalous samples alongside regular samples.

Conclusion: Incorporating anomalous samples can improve binary anomaly classification performance, especially in few-shot settings, offering a valuable addition to traditional methods focused on normal samples.

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of
non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is
typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot
settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant
difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous
samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a
methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly
detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We
compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study
the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an
augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the
different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular
industrial anomaly detection datasets.

### [253] [Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756)
*Diana Mortagua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System to select annotators for Active Learning, leveraging factors like mood and fatigue to minimize annotation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active Learning struggles with reducing labeling errors while being cost and time-efficient. Many existing strategies ignore key human cognitive factors like mood and fatigue, which heavily influence annotator performance.

Method: A Knowledge-Based Recommendation System ranks annotators based on their past accuracy, mood, fatigue levels, and characteristics of the queried instance. Annotators are simulated using realistic cognitive scenarios.

Result: The proposed system reduced annotation errors and model uncertainty compared to approaches that ignore cognitive factors. Accuracy and F1-score improvements were observed, though less pronounced.

Conclusion: Incorporating mood, fatigue, and past accuracy into annotator selection significantly enhances Active Learning efficiency and accuracy, marking an initial step towards addressing human cognitive factors in labeling tasks.

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best
annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of
minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and
time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data
needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,
aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.
Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that
affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.
This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only
considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue
levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a
Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available
annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using
their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as
information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing
literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating
annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.
The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and
fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,
and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not
using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the
proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The
methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open
challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of selecting the best machine learning model for a given task without extensive validation datasets by introducing an active model selection method called CODA, which reduces labeling efforts significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting the best machine learning model is challenging due to the time and expense of generating validation datasets. The paper aims to streamline this process by finding a way to prioritize labeling efficiently.

Method: The proposed method, CODA, uses predictions from candidate models to prioritize labeling test data points. It employs a probabilistic framework that combines consensus and disagreement between models to guide the label acquisition process and utilizes Bayesian inference to refine the choice of the best model.

Result: CODA was validated across 26 benchmark tasks and was found to significantly outperform existing active model selection methods, reducing annotation efforts by more than 70% compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CODA enables efficient active model selection, reducing the resources needed to identify the best model for a task and advancing the capability for practical machine learning applications.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a
challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for
a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally
answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and
time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using
predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data
points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA,
performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships
between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic
framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in
the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian
inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is
collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark
tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing
methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation
effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the
previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel neuron model founded on symmetric differential equations, revealing its dual functionality: signal propagation and oscillation generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the understanding of an efficient neuron model that can mimic dual roles observed in biological neurons, aiding neuromorphic engineering applications.

Method: The study utilized systematic parameter space exploration, mathematical analysis, and simulations to analyze the model, while introducing a new metric called on-road energy.

Result: Two functional modes were identified: asymptotically stable signal propagation and Lyapunov stable oscillatory signal generation. Parameter and connection structure adjustments influenced these modes.

Conclusion: The model provides insights into the dual roles of neurons, offering a theoretical foundation for neuromorphic applications like information transmission and rhythm generation.

Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed a novel neuron model based on symmetric
differential equations and demonstrated its potential as an efficient signal
propagator. Building upon that foundation, the present study delves deeper into
the intrinsic dynamics and functional diversity of this model. By
systematically exploring the parameter space and employing a range of
mathematical analysis tools, we theoretically reveal the system 's core
property of functional duality. Specifically, the model exhibits two distinct
trajectory behaviors: one is asymptotically stable, corresponding to a reliable
signal propagator; the other is Lyapunov stable, characterized by sustained
self-excited oscillations, functioning as a signal generator. To enable
effective monitoring and prediction of system states during simulations, we
introduce a novel intermediate-state metric termed on-road energy. Simulation
results confirm that transitions between the two functional modes can be
induced through parameter adjustments or modifications to the connection
structure. Moreover, we show that oscillations can be effectively suppressed by
introducing external signals. These findings draw a compelling parallel to the
dual roles of biological neurons in both information transmission and rhythm
generation, thereby establishing a solid theoretical basis and a clear
functional roadmap for the broader application of this model in neuromorphic
engineering.

TL;DR: The study aims to solve the nonlinear inverse problem in FDTR measurements by comparing four global optimization algorithms combined with local refinement methods to improve accuracy and speed. HPSO emerges as the leading hybrid approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address difficulties in extracting thermal properties from FDTR measurements due to the complex and non-convex nature of the optimization problem.

Method: Four global optimization techniques—GA, QGA, PSO, and FWA—were evaluated, which were then hybridized with Quasi-Newton local refinement methods, resulting in hybrid variants HGA, HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA.

Result: HPSO exhibited superior performance, achieving 80% target fitness within 60 seconds and faster convergence than other methods even in extended trials up to 1000 seconds.

Conclusion: HPSO is robust and efficient for solving inverse problems in thermal metrology, offering a general-purpose solution adaptable to other model-fitting challenges.

Abstract: Frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) is a widely used technique for
characterizing thermal properties of multilayer thin films. However, extracting
multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem
due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This
study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm
(GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of
a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60
seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven
hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a
Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA,
HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80%
of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater
robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of
HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then
evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each
algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA
consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster
than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems
in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EMG-based force estimation methods demand large datasets and high computational power, which hinder their real-time applications in embedded systems.

Method: The method utilizes spike trains from motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These signals are processed by a spiking neural network on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor.

Result: The approach yields accurate finger force predictions with minimal energy use, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time, low-power applications.

Conclusion: This work pioneers continuous motor neuron-based regression on neuromorphic hardware, marking a significant advancement in embedded prosthetics and wearable neurotechnology.

Abstract: Accurate finger force estimation is critical for next-generation
human-machine interfaces. Traditional electromyography (EMG)-based decoding
methods using deep learning require large datasets and high computational
resources, limiting their use in real-time, embedded systems. Here, we propose
a novel approach that performs finger force regression using spike trains from
individual motor neurons, extracted from high-density EMG. These biologically
grounded signals drive a spiking neural network implemented on a mixed-signal
neuromorphic processor. Unlike prior work that encodes EMG into events, our
method exploits spike timing on motor units to perform low-power, real-time
inference. This is the first demonstration of motor neuron-based continuous
regression computed directly on neuromorphic hardware. Our results confirm
accurate finger-specific force prediction with minimal energy use, opening new
possibilities for embedded decoding in prosthetics and wearable
neurotechnology.

TL;DR: The paper focuses on abstract interpretation via Galois connections for inferring bounds on recursively defined functions, introducing novel constraint-based domains for numerical functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of inferring closed-form bounds for recursively defined functions, with applications in program analysis and hybrid systems.

Method: Develops B-bound abstract domains for numerical functions and introduces domain abstraction for dimensionality reduction and symbolic-to-numerical mapping.

Result: The proposed method enables inference of complex numerical invariants and simplifies transfer function design via convexity properties.

Conclusion: The contributions advance function abstraction techniques, enhancing power in numerical and symbolic program analysis.

Abstract: We present theoretical and practical results on the order theory of lattices
of functions, focusing on Galois connections that abstract (sets of) functions
- a topic known as higher-order abstract interpretation.
  We are motivated by the challenge of inferring closed-form bounds on
functions which are defined recursively, i.e. as the fixed point of an operator
or, equivalently, as the solution to a functional equation. This has multiple
applications in program analysis (e.g. cost analysis, loop acceleration,
declarative language analysis) and in hybrid systems governed by differential
equations.
  Our main contribution is a new family of constraint-based abstract domains
for abstracting numerical functions, B-bound domains, which abstract a function
f by a conjunction of bounds from a preselected set of boundary functions. They
allow inferring highly non-linear numerical invariants, which classical
numerical abstract domains struggle with. We uncover a convexity property in
the constraint space that simplifies, and, in some cases, fully automates,
transfer function design.
  We also introduce domain abstraction, a functor that lifts arbitrary mappings
in value space to Galois connections in function space. This supports
abstraction from symbolic to numerical functions (i.e. size abstraction), and
enables dimensionality reduction of equations.
  We base our constructions of transfer functions on a simple operator
language, starting with sequences, and extending to more general functions,
including multivariate, piecewise, and non-discrete domains.

TL;DR: Kernel-FFI provides an innovative framework for enabling seamless cross-language function calls in interactive notebooks, addressing limitations of existing Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to solve issues in existing FFIs such as manual configuration, boilerplate, lack of support for recursive calls, and OOP constructs in modern notebook environments.

Method: Kernel-FFI uses source-level transformation for rewriting cross-language invocations, supports foreign object referencing, and introduces a side-channel communication mechanism for recursive and asynchronous foreign calls.

Result: Kernel-FFI offers seamless interoperability between programming languages in interactive notebook environments without substantial configuration or manual bindings.

Conclusion: Kernel-FFI enhances productivity in multi-language development by introducing a transparent and efficient solution for dynamic workflows in interactive notebooks.

Abstract: Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs) are essential for enabling
interoperability between programming languages, yet existing FFI solutions are
ill-suited for the dynamic, interactive workflows prevalent in modern notebook
environments such as Jupyter. Current approaches require extensive manual
configuration, introduce significant boilerplate, and often lack support for
recursive calls and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs-features
critical for productive, multi-language development.
  We present Kernel-FFI, a transparent, language-agnostic framework that
enables seamless cross-language function calls and object manipulation within
interactive notebooks. Kernel-FFI employs source-level transformation to
automatically rewrite cross-language invocations, eliminating the need for
manual bindings or boilerplate. Kernel-FFI provides robust support for OOP by
enabling foreign object referencing and automatic resource management across
language boundaries. Furthermore, to address the blocking nature of Jupyter
kernels and support recursive and asynchronous foreign calls, we introduce a
novel side-channel communication mechanism. Our tool will be open-sourced and

### [260] [Learning to Prune Branches in Modern Tree-Fruit Orchards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23015)
*Abhinav Jain,Cindy Grimm,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This research introduces a robotic pruning system that uses visuomotor control guided by optical flow from a wrist-mounted camera, eliminating the need for full 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning trees in orchards is a labor-intensive process that is vital for maintaining high productivity. Automating this process could reduce labor needs and enhance efficiency.

Method: The proposed system employs a closed-loop visuomotor controller trained using a simulation of apple orchard branch distribution. It uses optical flow images for guiding a cutting tool in dense tree environments.

Result: In both simulations and real-world tests, the system achieved a 30% success rate in pruning tasks, which is about half the efficiency of an ideal oracle planner.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the potential of using simple optical flow data for robotic pruning, achieving moderate success without complex 3D reconstruction techniques.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern
highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop
visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter
through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures
the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a
novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches
in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring
full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a
wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the
real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer,
achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle
planner.

### [261] [A Certifably Correct Algorithm for Generalized Robot-World and Hand-Eye Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23045)
*Emmett Wise,Pushyami Kaveti,Qilong Chen,Wenhao Wang,Hanumant Singh,Jonathan Kelly,David M. Rosen,Matthew Giamou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast and globally optimal algorithm for sensor calibration, specifically addressing the robot-world and hand-eye calibration (RWHEC) problem with improved assumptions and capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of obtaining accurate sensor calibration parameters increases with the number of deployed sensors, prompting a need for computationally efficient and general calibration methods with minimal operator effort.

Method: The authors propose a globally optimal algorithm for RWHEC that supports multiple sensors and poses, handles monocular cameras, derives identifiability criteria, and includes a Lie-algebraic local solver.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates better performance than existing solutions, provides global optimality guarantees with bounded errors, and is supported by open-source tools and experiments.

Conclusion: The work advances automatic sensor calibration by offering a generalized, efficient, and scalable solution, complete with theoretical insights and practical implementations.

Abstract: Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for
multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be
computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the
sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the
engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases
with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods
requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from
human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally
optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the
$\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The
formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the
simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the
use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their
environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance
over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish
$\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with
bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic
local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and
prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our
algorithms and experiments.

*Yuanhao Chen,Liu Zhao,Ji Ma,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a novel motion generation and imitation learning framework for quadruped robots, enabling them to perform diverse locomotion styles effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in reference motion data diversity that hinder versatile locomotion in quadruped robots.

Method: A unified pipeline is proposed with two key components: 1) A CVAE-based motion generator synthesizing diverse and physically plausible locomotion sequences, and 2) Adoption of adversarial motion priors to improve controller stability and velocity tracking.

Result: The approach shows significant improvements in velocity tracking and stability, with successful deployment on a real quadruped robot, enabling it to execute complex motions like galloping and trotting.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances quadruped robot motion generation and control, validating its practical application in real-world locomotion scenarios.

Abstract: Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion
due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these
challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based
multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic
advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes
a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE
based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible
locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding
physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold
continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning
multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic
morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We
validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller
stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework
demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment
stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped
robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to
generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod,
trotting and pacing.

*Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Jiru Xu,Roger D. Soberanis Mukul,Hao Ding,Grayson Byrd,Yu-Chun Ku,Jose L. Porras,Masaru Ishii,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Perception Agent, a system leveraging advanced AI tools like LLMs, SAM, and memory mechanisms to enable flexible and intuitive human-machine interaction for real-time surgical assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-driven human-machine interaction systems in dynamic surgical environments are rigid, overly reliant on pre-training, and constrained by fixed object categories and manual prompting.

Method: The authors propose Perception Agent, integrating speech-enabled large language models, SAM, any-point tracking models, memory repositories, and new mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements during surgeries.

Result: The Perception Agent performs competitively to manual strategies while offering more flexibility in unfamiliar scenarios, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including novel element segmentation.

Conclusion: Perception Agent enhances natural and intuitive interactions, removing rigidity in current solutions and advancing real-time adaptive AI for surgical environments.

Abstract: Emerging surgical data science and robotics solutions, especially those
designed to provide assistance in situ, require natural human-machine
interfaces to fully unlock their potential in providing adaptive and intuitive
aid. Contemporary AI-driven solutions remain inherently rigid, offering limited
flexibility and restricting natural human-machine interaction in dynamic
surgical environments. These solutions rely heavily on extensive task-specific
pre-training, fixed object categories, and explicit manual-prompting. This work
introduces a novel Perception Agent that leverages speech-integrated
prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), segment anything model (SAM),
and any-point tracking foundation models to enable a more natural human-machine
interaction in real-time intraoperative surgical assistance. Incorporating a
memory repository and two novel mechanisms for segmenting unseen elements,
Perception Agent offers the flexibility to segment both known and unseen
elements in the surgical scene through intuitive interaction. Incorporating the
ability to memorize novel elements for use in future surgeries, this work takes
a marked step towards human-machine symbiosis in surgical procedures. Through
quantitative analysis on a public dataset, we show that the performance of our
agent is on par with considerably more labor-intensive manual-prompting
strategies. Qualitatively, we show the flexibility of our agent in segmenting
novel elements (instruments, phantom grafts, and gauze) in a custom-curated
dataset. By offering natural human-machine interaction and overcoming rigidity,
our Perception Agent potentially brings AI-based real-time assistance in
dynamic surgical environments closer to reality.

### [264] [Benchmarking Massively Parallelized Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Robotics Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23172)
*Vira Joshi,Zifan Xu,Bo Liu,Peter Stone,Amy Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces MTBench, a massively parallelized benchmark designed for evaluating multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) in robotics, leveraging GPU-accelerated simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address limitations in existing MTRL research, which predominantly employs low-parallelization and off-policy methods, limiting its ability to capitalize on faster, on-policy algorithms and the advantages of GPU-accelerated simulations.

Method: MTBench provides a benchmark featuring 70 diverse robotic tasks and utilizes the IsaacGym GPU-accelerated simulator. It integrates base RL algorithms with state-of-the-art MTRL architectures, enabling unified performance evaluation.

Result: The study demonstrates faster evaluation speeds for MTRL approaches using MTBench, while identifying unique challenges posed by massive parallelism combined with MTRL.

Conclusion: MTBench offers a valuable tool for accelerating MTRL research with massively parallelized evaluations and highlights challenges researchers must address in future advancements.

Abstract: Multi-task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) has emerged as a critical training
paradigm for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to a set of complex
real-world robotic tasks, which demands a generalizable and robust policy. At
the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity,
not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated
simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks
by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research
has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the
low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic
performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the
current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization
offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark
for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad
distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented
using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base
RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and
architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance.
Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL
approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise
from combining massive parallelism with MTRL. Code is available at

*Chenghao Wang,Eric Sihite,Kaushik Venkatesh Krishnamurthy,Shreyansh Pitroda,Adarsh Salagame,Alireza Ramezani,Morteza Gharib*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The Husky Beta robot uses thrusters for thruster-assisted walking, emphasizing narrow-path stability and lateral push-recovery in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legged robots have made strides in agility, but stability and locomotion plasticity need further enhancement. This study explores the use of thrusters to achieve better balance and maneuverability.

Method: Simulation study on the Husky Beta robot with a centroidal dynamics model. Thruster forces and foot-ground contacts are controlled via a Quadratic Programming (QP) solver in a model predictive control framework.

Result: Husky Beta can stably walk on narrow paths and recover from lateral pushes by utilizing thrusters for stabilization.

Conclusion: Utilizing thrusters improves the stability and dynamic control of legged-aerial robots, allowing for advanced maneuvers like narrow-path walking and push recovery.

Abstract: There has been significant advancement in legged robot's agility where they
can show impressive acrobatic maneuvers, such as parkour. These maneuvers rely
heavily on posture manipulation. To expand the stability and locomotion
plasticity, we use the multi-modal ability in our legged-aerial platform, the
Husky Beta, to perform thruster-assisted walking. This robot has thrusters on
each of its sagittal knee joints which can be used to stabilize its frontal
dynamic as it walks. In this work, we perform a simulation study of quadruped
narrow-path walking with Husky $\beta$, where the robot will utilize its
thrusters to stably walk on a narrow path. The controller is designed based on
a centroidal dynamics model with thruster and foot ground contact forces as
inputs. These inputs are regulated using a QP solver to be used in a model
predictive control framework. In addition to narrow-path walking, we also
perform a lateral push-recovery simulation to study how the thrusters can be
used to stabilize the frontal dynamics.

### [266] [Simulation-based planning of Motion Sequences for Automated Procedure Optimization in Multi-Robot Assembly Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23270)
*Loris Schneider,Marc Ungen,Elias Huber,Jan-Felix Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation-based method for planning optimized, coordinated motion sequences in reconfigurable multi-robot cells for faster assembly processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of generating efficient, coordinated multi-robot motion sequences to minimize assembly durations in reconfigurable environments.

Method: Separated assembly operations into core (pre-determined) and traverse (optimizable) tasks, and proposed a decomposition-based motion planning strategy using several optimization techniques like sampling heuristic and gradient-free optimization.

Result: Efficient, collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures were generated, outperforming a baseline decentralized motion planning approach, as demonstrated via simulations.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust, optimized solution for coordinated multi-robot assembly operations, offering improvements in efficiency and assembly performance.

Abstract: Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet
fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their
configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized,
coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration.
This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized
sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core
operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are
constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial
optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an
optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated
using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution
techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and
gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is
proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved
independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed
method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures
that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion
planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

*Jaeseok Park,Chanoh Park,Minsu Kim,Soohwan Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GFusion integrates LiDAR, inertial, and visual data into 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality mapping, addressing challenges like sparse data through novel constraint and initialization strategies, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping using RGB-D sensors and improve integration with LiDAR technology for better mapping in diverse environments.

Method: GFusion employs a LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping framework with surfel-to-surfel constraints in pose-graph optimization, pixel-aware Gaussian initialization, and bounded sigmoid constraint strategies.

Result: Experiments show superior rendering quality and map-building efficiency compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: GFusion advances LiDAR-based 3DGS mapping systems by resolving key issues such as sparse data representation and map consistency through innovative techniques.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized photorealistic mapping,
conventional approaches based on camera sensor, even RGB-D, suffer from
fundamental limitations such as high computational load, failure in
environments with poor texture or illumination, and short operational ranges.
LiDAR emerges as a robust alternative, but its integration with 3DGS introduces
new challenges, such as the need for exceptional global alignment for
photorealistic quality and prolonged optimization times caused by sparse data.
To address these challenges, we propose GSFusion, an online
LiDAR-Inertial-Visual mapping system that ensures high-precision map
consistency through a surfel-to-surfel constraint in the global pose-graph
optimization. To handle sparse data, our system employs a pixel-aware Gaussian
initialization strategy for efficient representation and a bounded sigmoid
constraint to prevent uncontrolled Gaussian growth. Experiments on public and
our datasets demonstrate our system outperforms existing 3DGS SLAM systems in
terms of rendering quality and map-building efficiency.

*Yixuan Dang,Qinyang Xu,Yu Zhang,Xiangtong Yao,Liding Zhang,Zhenshan Bing,Florian Roehrbein,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper develops a whisker-inspired tactile sensor system that actively controls contact orientation, enabling accurate surface contour reconstruction with sub-millimeter precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of active control in whisker-inspired sensors for tactile perception, especially for precise contour reconstruction and tip contact localization.

Method: The method involves designing a whisker sensor with a flexible suspension system, extracting tip contact positions via a deflection profile using gradient descent and a Bayesian filter, and implementing an active control policy utilizing B-Spline curve predictions for optimal orientation.

Result: The results show that the algorithm effectively tracks surfaces and reconstructs contours with sub-millimeter accuracy, validated through simulations and real-world tests on diverse objects.

Conclusion: The developed system successfully enhances tactile perception with precise contour following and reconstruction, demonstrating significant robustness and accuracy in both simulation and physical environments.

Abstract: Perception using whisker-inspired tactile sensors currently faces a major
challenge: the lack of active control in robots based on direct contact
information from the whisker. To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is
crucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an
appropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important
for localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp
surfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we
first construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact
and robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop
a method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly
extract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter
applied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy
to maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object
surface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature
and determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm
can effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter
accuracy. Finally, we validate the method in simulations and real-world
experiments where a robot arm drives the whisker sensor to follow the surfaces
of three different objects.

*Lucas Elbert Suryana,Saeed Rahmani,Simeon Craig Calvert,Arkady Zgonnikov,Bart van Arem*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to improve decision-making in automated vehicles, emphasizing ethical and human-aligned behavior in everyday driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current automated vehicle (AV) planning systems, which struggle with ethical decision-making in routine driving contexts due to rigid rules.

Method: The authors propose a reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework, which quantifies human agents’ reasons (e.g., legality and comfort) and evaluates AV trajectories’ alignment with these values using adjustable priority weights and a balance function.

Result: The framework reveals trade-offs between human considerations like regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort in a real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, demonstrating its interpretability and ethical evaluation capabilities.

Conclusion: This work presents a modular and transparent tool for improving ethical alignment in AV systems and advancing the implementation of Meaningful Human Control (MHC) in real-world situations.

Abstract: A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make
appropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.
While much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as
trolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as
navigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including
legality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically
rely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations
and can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper
proposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that
operationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The
framework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as
quantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align
with these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and
integrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the
framework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a
real-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals
tensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.
The framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning
algorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in
everyday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in
real-world AV deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for improving vehicle drifting in both simulated and real-world conditions, using GPU-based simulation and domain randomization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the simulation-to-reality gap in reinforcement learning methods applied to vehicle drifting, which often results in performance failures when transferring policies from simulations to physical systems.

Method: The authors developed a reinforcement learning framework that uses GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and domain randomization techniques. They validated their approach on a custom 1/10 scale RC car with independent wheel speed control.

Result: Experiments show that the framework delivers effective trajectory tracking and controlled sideslip angles in diverse drifting scenarios, ranging from circular drifting to complex path following, applicable in simulation and real-world contexts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that their approach successfully bridges the simulation-to-reality gap, providing a robust solution for controlled drifting in emergency scenarios.

Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles,
is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits.
While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting
control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as
policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to
physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework
with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization
that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both
simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel
Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control.
Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to
direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that
our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled
sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world
environments.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a navigation framework for autonomous agricultural robots using a Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem-based global path planner and a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control strategy for local control and trajectory optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently navigating autonomous robots in unstructured agricultural environments while minimizing soil damage and optimizing path length and curvature.

Method: The approach integrates a global Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) path planner and a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy for localized path planning and control, validated through simulations on real-world datasets.

Result: The framework achieved smoother and shorter paths with a 16% reduction in path length compared to decoupled methods, while the NMPC ensured precise waypoint targeting and constraint adherence.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for autonomous navigation in agricultural settings, offering improvements in path optimization and control performance.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating
unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows
require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while
minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent
soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated
navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins
Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
(NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a
minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets,
while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately
reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative
simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the
coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a
reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods.
Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired
waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to
constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework
for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.

*Yuta Kawachi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physics-guided gain regularization method combined with parameter-conditioned control to bridge the sim-to-real gap for robots using high-gear-ratio actuators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional domain randomization often fails for robots with high gear ratios, leading to major sim-to-real discrepancies.

Method: The authors reinterpret PID controller gains to capture unmodeled robot dynamics, perform real-world gain analysis, penalize deviations during training, and condition controllers on plant parameters.

Result: The regularized controller outperformed domain randomization approaches, achieving comparable simulation and hardware behavior without oscillations.

Conclusion: The framework addresses sim-to-real transfer issues effectively, providing a low-cost solution for robotic systems with complex dynamics.

Abstract: Simulation-to-real transfer using domain randomization for robot control
often relies on low-gear-ratio, backdrivable actuators, but these approaches
break down when the sim-to-real gap widens. Inspired by the traditional PID
controller, we reinterpret its gains as surrogates for complex, unmodeled plant
dynamics. We then introduce a physics-guided gain regularization scheme that
measures a robot's effective proportional gains via simple real-world
experiments. Then, we penalize any deviation of a neural controller's local
input-output sensitivities from these values during training. To avoid the
overly conservative bias of naive domain randomization, we also condition the
controller on the current plant parameters. On an off-the-shelf two-wheeled
balancing robot with a 110:1 gearbox, our gain-regularized,
parameter-conditioned RNN achieves angular settling times in hardware that
closely match simulation. At the same time, a purely domain-randomized policy
exhibits persistent oscillations and a substantial sim-to-real gap. These
results demonstrate a lightweight, reproducible framework for closing
sim-to-real gaps on affordable robotic hardware.

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-RDT, a method leveraging human manipulation data for improving robotic manipulation through pre-training and fine-tuning, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation struggles with the lack of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data, necessitating alternative strategies for policy learning.

Method: A two-stage training framework combining pre-training on human manipulation data with fine-tuning on robot-specific data using a diffusion transformer to handle complex actions.

Result: H-RDT outperformed state-of-the-art methods like Pi0 and RDT by 13.9% in simulations and 40.5% in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Human manipulation data provides a robust foundation for training adaptable and efficient bimanual robotic manipulation policies, demonstrating substantial benefits for robotic applications.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:
the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent
robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to
increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse
morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified
training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics
Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data
to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale
egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations
provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and
can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training
paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,
and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action
encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B
parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.
Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,
single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and
robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from
scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving
significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in
simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our
core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation
for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems face significant challenges in achieving
human-like adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex,
open-world environments. These challenges stem from fragmented architectures,
limited generalization to novel scenarios, and insufficient semantic extraction
from perception. To address these limitations, we propose a unified
Perception-Language-Action (PLA) framework that integrates multi-sensor fusion
(cameras, LiDAR, radar) with a large language model (LLM)-augmented
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture, specifically a GPT-4.1-powered
reasoning core. This framework unifies low-level sensory processing with
high-level contextual reasoning, tightly coupling perception with natural
language-based semantic understanding and decision-making to enable
context-aware, explainable, and safety-bounded autonomous driving. Evaluations
on an urban intersection scenario with a construction zone demonstrate superior
performance in trajectory tracking, speed prediction, and adaptive planning.
The results highlight the potential of language-augmented cognitive frameworks
for advancing the safety, interpretability, and scalability of autonomous
driving systems.

*Ryo Miyoshi,Yuki Okafuji,Takuya Iwamoto,Junya Nakanishi,Jun Baba*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Transformer-based method for estimating user experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) using facial expressions and voice, outperforming human evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for social robots to adapt their behaviors by accurately assessing user experience (UX) in HRI, which is currently done using fragmented approaches focusing on individual aspects of UX.

Method: The paper constructs a UX dataset and develops a Transformer-based model leveraging multimodal social signals such as facial expressions and voice. It employs a multi-instance learning framework to capture both short- and long-term interaction patterns.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses third-party human evaluators in effectively estimating UX during HRI.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a holistic and more effective way of assessing UX, enabling social robots to better adapt to users' states during interactions.

Abstract: In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to
adapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user
experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this
adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as
sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these
individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging
multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a
Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for
estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our
approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a
multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal
dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX
estimation.

### [276] [Can LLM-Reasoning Models Replace Classical Planning? A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23589)
*Kai Goebel,Patrik Zips*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) in robotic task planning, especially regarding their ability to generate structured and executable plans, against classical planners like Fast Downward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if Large Language Models can effectively handle robotic task planning and identify their limitations when compared to traditional planning systems.

Method: The paper evaluates various state-of-the-art language models by prompting them with Planning Domain Definition Language files and comparing their planning performance against the Fast Downward planner through benchmarks.

Result: The large language models excelled in simpler tasks but struggled with complex scenarios involving strict constraints, resource management, and consistent state tracking.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in robotic planning but are currently unreliable for complex tasks. The results suggest pursuing a hybrid approach combining language models with classical planners to enhance reliability and scalability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have sparked interest in their
potential for robotic task planning. While these models demonstrate strong
generative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and
executable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation
of a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly
prompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,
and compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a
variety of benchmarks. In addition to measuring success rates, we assess how
faithfully the generated plans translate into sequences of actions that can
actually be executed, identifying both strengths and limitations of using these
models in this setting. Our findings show that while the models perform well on
simpler planning tasks, they continue to struggle with more complex scenarios
that require precise resource management, consistent state tracking, and strict
constraint compliance. These results underscore fundamental challenges in
applying language models to robotic planning in real world environments. By
outlining the gaps that emerge during execution, we aim to guide future
research toward combined approaches that integrate language models with
classical planners in order to enhance the reliability and scalability of
planning in autonomous robotics.

*Haiyun Zhang,Stefano Dalla Gasperina,Saad N. Yousaf,Toshimitsu Tsuboi,Tetsuya Narita,Ashish D. Deshpande*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a subject-specific calibration framework for hand exoskeletons to enhance accurate hand tracking using redundant joint sensing and optimization strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand exoskeletons face challenges in precise tracking due to anatomical variability and inconsistencies when worn, impacting their effectiveness in precision tasks such as teleoperation.

Method: The proposed method leverages redundant joint sensing and residual-weighted optimization to calibrate virtual link parameters. It uses motion capture data to tune cost function weights empirically, improving calibration consistency.

Result: The framework significantly reduced joint angle and fingertip tracking errors across seven participants, demonstrating improvements in tracking accuracy compared to uncalibrated models.

Conclusion: This calibration framework enhances tracking fidelity for hand exoskeletons and generalizes across designs, supporting applications in teleoperation and demonstration-based learning.

Abstract: Hand exoskeletons are critical tools for dexterous teleoperation and
immersive manipulation interfaces, but achieving accurate hand tracking remains
a challenge due to user-specific anatomical variability and donning
inconsistencies. These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade
tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a
subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that
uses redundant joint sensing and a residual-weighted optimization strategy to
estimate virtual link parameters. Implemented on the Maestro exoskeleton, our
method improves joint angle and fingertip position estimation across users with
varying hand geometries. We introduce a data-driven approach to empirically
tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling more
accurate and consistent calibration across participants. Quantitative results
from seven subjects show substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking
errors compared to uncalibrated and evenly weighted models. Qualitative
visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further confirm improvements in
motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes across exoskeleton designs
with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, and lays the foundation for
high-fidelity teleoperation and learning-from-demonstration applications.

Result: The approach demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods in simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DRACo-SLAM2 enhances distributed underwater SLAM capabilities, particularly in time-efficient inter-robot cooperation and accurate scan matching.

Abstract: We present DRACo-SLAM2, a distributed SLAM framework for underwater robot
teams equipped with multibeam imaging sonar. This framework improves upon the
original DRACo-SLAM by introducing a novel representation of sonar maps as
object graphs and utilizing object graph matching to achieve time-efficient
inter-robot loop closure detection without relying on prior geometric
information. To better-accommodate the needs and characteristics of underwater
scan matching, we propose incremental Group-wise Consistent Measurement Set
Maximization (GCM), a modification of Pairwise Consistent Measurement Set

TL;DR: The paper proposes DuLoc, a new LiDAR-based localization framework that combines global maps and real-time local maps, outperforming existing methods in real-world, dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR-based localization methods struggle with long-term environmental changes, often resulting in localization drift and reduced reliability, especially in dynamic scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces DuLoc, which tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based localization and uses a constant-velocity motion model to reduce outliers. It integrates prior global maps with real-time local maps for adaptability.

Result: Extensive real-world experiments conducted on 32 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs) over 2,856 hours in an unbounded port environment show that DuLoc outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in changing outdoor conditions.

Conclusion: DuLoc offers a robust and accurate solution for LiDAR-based localization, effectively handling dynamic and unbounded environments, demonstrating improved performance and reliability in large-scale operational scenarios.

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization serves as a critical component in autonomous
systems, yet existing approaches face persistent challenges in balancing
repeatability, accuracy, and environmental adaptability. Traditional point
cloud registration methods relying solely on offline maps often exhibit limited
robustness against long-term environmental changes, leading to localization
drift and reliability degradation in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization
method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based
localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate
outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based
localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with
dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and
changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port
that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided
Vehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained
demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR
localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments.

Conclusion: BGS-SLAM effectively bridges the gap for large-scale outdoor SLAM applications without the need for LiDAR or active sensing, demonstrating robustness and efficiency in diverse settings.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity in SLAM
applications due to its fast rendering and high-fidelity representation.
However, existing 3DGS-SLAM systems have predominantly focused on indoor
environments and relied on active depth sensors, leaving a gap for large-scale
outdoor applications. We present BGS-SLAM, the first binocular 3D Gaussian
Splatting SLAM system designed for outdoor scenarios. Our approach uses only
RGB stereo pairs without requiring LiDAR or active sensors. BGS-SLAM leverages
depth estimates from pre-trained deep stereo networks to guide 3D Gaussian
optimization with a multi-loss strategy enhancing both geometric consistency
and visual quality. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that BGS-SLAM
achieves superior tracking accuracy and mapping performance compared to other
3DGS-based solutions in complex outdoor environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve robot manipulation policies with better generalization using latent actions in visual-language-action models.

Method: Introduce the ViLLA framework with refined latent action learning and integration techniques.

Result: Achieved superior robot manipulation across simulated environments (SIMPLER, LIBERO) and real-world setups (gripper, dexterous hand).

Conclusion: villa-X demonstrates potential for advancing robust and generalizable robot manipulation research.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for
learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and
generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the
incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change
between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X,
a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent
action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our
approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are
incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable
villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including
SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper
and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds
significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for
future research.

TL;DR: The paper shows how reinforcement learning (RL) can enable visuomotor agents to generalize to unseen environments, specifically in Minecraft, by employing automated task synthesis and a distributed RL framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to overcome RL models' tendency to overfit on specific tasks or environments, limiting their ability to generalize in visuomotor scenarios.

Method: The paper uses automated task synthesis in Minecraft for large-scale RL training and cross-view goal specifications for multi-task RL representation. A distributed RL framework is employed for scalability.

Result: RL training improves interaction success rates by 4 times and achieves zero-shot generalization in spatial reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings.

Conclusion: RL in 3D simulated environments, particularly those with scalable task generation like Minecraft, can significantly enhance visuomotor agents' capabilities in spatial reasoning and generalization to new environments.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in language
modeling, its triumph hasn't yet fully translated to visuomotor agents. A
primary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or
environments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors
across diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this
challenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can
achieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore
RL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction
capabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL
representation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a
unified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome
the significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task
synthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale
multi-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework
to support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction
success rates by $4\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial
reasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our
findings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated
environments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for
significantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.

TL;DR: The study introduces CITRAS, a bioinspired tactile sensor modeled after cockroach antennae, featuring compactness, low-power consumption, and multifunctional tactile perception capabilities for improving insect-scale robot navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing sensor technologies in insect-scale robots caused by size, weight, and power constraints, and to replicate the robust tactile sensing seen in nature.

Method: Developed a compliant, segmented laminate sensor inspired by cockroach antennae, integrating capacitive angle sensors to measure hinge angles and enable tactile perception.

Result: CITRAS achieved a maximum hinge angle measurement error of 0.79° (quasistatic) and 3.58° (dynamic), successfully estimated environmental properties, and distinguished surface textures with high precision.

Conclusion: The bioinspired CITRAS sensor fills significant gaps in tactile sensing for insect-scale robots, enabling advanced exploration and navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: The American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) uses its soft antennae to
guide decision making by extracting rich tactile information from tens of
thousands of distributed mechanosensors. Although tactile sensors enable
robust, autonomous perception and navigation in natural systems, replicating
these capabilities in insect-scale robots remains challenging due to stringent
size, weight, and power constraints that limit existing sensor technologies. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CITRAS (Cockroach Inspired Tactile
Robotic Antenna Sensor), a bioinspired, multi-segmented, compliant laminate
sensor with embedded capacitive angle sensors. CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1
mm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration
with miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively
bends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle
measurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and
3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'
multifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip
distances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %
error, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor
response. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in
insect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced
autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in
complex, confined environments.

TL;DR: This study evaluates large language models (LLMs) for generating smart contracts from business process descriptions, revealing their shortcomings in achieving perfect reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based approaches for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions.

Method: Develop and use an automated evaluation framework to test LLMs of various types and sizes on process execution properties like flow, resource allocation, and data conditions.

Result: LLMs perform below expectations for the perfect reliability required in smart contract generation.

Conclusion: Future work should develop responsible LLM integrations in existing tools to ensure more reliable code generation outputs, using the proposed benchmarking framework as a foundation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have changed the reality of how software is
produced. Within the wider software engineering community, among many other
purposes, they are explored for code generation use cases from different types
of input. In this work, we present an exploratory study to investigate the use
of LLMs for generating smart contract code from business process descriptions,
an idea that has emerged in recent literature to overcome the limitations of
traditional rule-based code generation approaches. However, current LLM-based
work evaluates generated code on small samples, relying on manual inspection,
or testing whether code compiles but ignoring correct execution. With this
work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework and provide empirical data
from larger data sets of process models. We test LLMs of different types and
sizes in their capabilities of achieving important properties of process
execution, including enforcing process flow, resource allocation, and
data-based conditions. Our results show that LLM performance falls short of the
perfect reliability required for smart contract development. We suggest future
work to explore responsible LLM integrations in existing tools for code
generation to ensure more reliable output. Our benchmarking framework can serve
as a foundation for developing and evaluating such integrations.

TL;DR: FlowETL is an autonomous ETL pipeline that standardizes datasets by learning transformations from user-provided input-output examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ETL processes rely heavily on human intervention and lack generalizability, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: FlowETL employs a Planning Engine to create transformation plans based on example datasets, which are executed by an ETL worker, with monitoring and logging for tracking.

Result: FlowETL demonstrates solid generalization across 14 diverse datasets, effectively automating ETL processes.

Conclusion: FlowETL can reduce dependence on human involvement by automating the design and execution of ETL transformations, improving generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow is fundamental for populating and
maintaining data warehouses and other data stores accessed by analysts for
downstream tasks. A major shortcoming of modern ETL solutions is the extensive
need for a human-in-the-loop, required to design and implement
context-specific, and often non-generalisable transformations. While related
work in the field of ETL automation shows promising progress, there is a lack
of solutions capable of automatically designing and applying these
transformations. We present FlowETL, a novel example-based autonomous ETL
pipeline architecture designed to automatically standardise and prepare input
datasets according to a concise, user-defined target dataset. FlowETL is an
ecosystem of components which interact together to achieve the desired outcome.
A Planning Engine uses a paired input-output datasets sample to construct a
transformation plan, which is then applied by an ETL worker to the source
dataset. Monitoring and logging provide observability throughout the entire
pipeline. The results show promising generalisation capabilities across 14
datasets of various domains, file structures, and file sizes.

phenomenon in the platform's largest segment, Continuous Integration (CI), by
linking 6,983 CI Actions to 3,869 providers and mining their version histories.
Our graph model timestamps every functionality's debut, tracks its adoption,

TL;DR: AutoBridge automates IoT integration code generation using a divide-and-conquer strategy, achieving high success and functional coverage rates, with debugging pipelines supporting correctness and minimal user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of integrating IoT devices into centralized platforms, which requires significant human expertise and effort to write complex integration code.

Method: AutoBridge employs a divide-and-conquer approach to generate IoT integration code, combines debugging pipelines for correctness, including virtual and hardware-in-the-loop debuggers requiring limited user feedback.

Result: AutoBridge demonstrated an average success rate of 93.87% and function coverage of 94.87% on benchmark tests, improving to 100% with minimal user feedback. It also outperformed expert programmers in accuracy by 50%–80% in a user study.

Conclusion: The AutoBridge system simplifies and enhances the IoT device integration process through automation and minimal user input, achieving results superior to those by human experts using code generation tools.

Abstract: Multimodal IoT systems coordinate diverse IoT devices to deliver
human-centered services. The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the
management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it
requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT
integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device
functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code
generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it
first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving
device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code
using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a
multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT
device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires
only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We
evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT
platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average
success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any
human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code
is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15
participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by
50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use

*Peter Fettke,Fabiana Fournier,Lior Limonad,Andreas Metzger,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma,Barbara Weber*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper makes a case for eXplainable Autonomous Business Processes (XABPs) to address potential risks and enhance stakeholder trust by presenting a systematic approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous business processes (ABPs) can provide significant benefits like operational efficiency and reducing human workload. However, they bring concerns such as decreased trust, debugging challenges, and compliance issues that need to be addressed.

Method: The authors propose a systematic approach to XABPs, including characterizing their explainability forms, structuring their rationale, and identifying key research challenges in Business Process Management.

Result: The paper provides a conceptual framework for explainability in ABPs, suggesting ways to mitigate risks and concerns associated with autonomous systems.

Conclusion: Explainability in ABPs (XABPs) is crucial for addressing concerns and ensuring their successful, trustworthy implementation. The paper sets a foundation for future research in this area.

Abstract: Autonomous business processes (ABPs), i.e., self-executing workflows
leveraging AI/ML, have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce
errors, lower costs, improve response times, and free human workers for more
strategic and creative work. However, ABPs may raise specific concerns
including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered
accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue
for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to
articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs,
characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM
research challenges towards XABPs.

### [291] [SWE-Debate: Competitive Multi-Agent Debate for Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23348)
*Han Li,Yuling Shi,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Heng Lian,Xin Wang,Yantao Jia,Tao Huang,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Debate, a multi-agent debate framework that enhances issue resolution in software engineering by enabling more collaborative and diverse reasoning. It outperforms existing methodologies in state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Although agent-based issue resolution frameworks like SWE-agent have shown potential, they often fall short in identifying overarching issue patterns across codebases due to their focus on independent agent explorations. This paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: SWE-Debate utilizes a competitive, structured, multi-agent debate approach. It creates fault propagation traces via a code dependency graph and organizes a three-round debate among agents with distinct reasoning perspectives. The debated conclusions are used to finalize a fix plan, integrated with an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch production.

Result: The SWE-Debate framework establishes new state-of-the-art results on the SWE-bench benchmark, significantly outperforming baseline approaches in issue resolution efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: By encouraging diverse reasoning through structured multi-agent debates, SWE-Debate offers an effective solution for issue localization and patch generation, marking a substantial advancement over traditional independent-exploration-based methods.

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based
frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling
autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks.
While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on
agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and
fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the
codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive
multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and
achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates
multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a
code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among
specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the
fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to
collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated
fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch
generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate
achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and
outperforms baselines by a large margin.

### [293] [SWE-Exp: Experience-Driven Software Issue Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23361)
*Silin Chen,Shaoxin Lin,Xiaodong Gu,Yuling Shi,Heng Lian,Longfei Yun,Dong Chen,Weiguo Sun,Lin Cao,Qianxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWE-Exp introduces an experience-based approach for LLM agents to reuse knowledge, boosting software issue resolution rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language model agents lack memory and reuse capabilities, leading to inefficiencies in resolving software issues.

Method: SWE-Exp introduces an experience bank that systematically stores and reuses successful and failed repair attempts across various comprehension levels.

Result: SWE-Exp achieves 41.6% Pass@1 rate on SWE-bench-Verified, showcasing state-of-the-art performance in issue resolution.

Conclusion: SWE-Exp paves the way for agents to shift from trial-and-error approaches to efficient, experience-driven issue resolution strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable
progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as
multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current
agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without
retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to
redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt
successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this
problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills
concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling
continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted
experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts.
Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different
levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes.
Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6%
Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach
establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents
systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting
from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue
resolution.

Conclusion: Trae Agent advances the state-of-the-art in software issue resolution, addressing critical limitations in existing methods. It is open-sourced to encourage further research in the field.

Abstract: Software issue resolution is a critical challenge in software engineering and
has garnered increasing attention in recent years. With the rapid advancement
of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in
addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have
introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of
LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still
face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the
capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their
overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first
agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.
Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and
addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level
understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.
We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted
SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art
ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent
consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of
10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first
place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of
75.20%. We are pleased to release Trae Agent as an open-source project to
support the research community, with all resources available at

*Samah Kansab,Mohammed Sayagh,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores code review efforts, particularly the adjustments made after submission in GitLab Merge Requests, using machine learning to predict and analyze factors contributing to these efforts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code reviews are critical for proper integration of new code but often result in significant efforts. The motivation is to better understand and predict the effort required during code reviews for GitLab Merge Requests, which is relatively understudied.

Method: The authors analyzed over 23,600 GitLab Merge Requests to define "effort" as the amount of code modified after submission. They trained an interpretable machine learning model using metrics like code complexity, developer experience, text features, and review history.

Result: Up to 71% of MRs required adjustments post-submission, with 28% changes exceeding 200 lines of code. Their model performed well (AUC 0.84-0.88) and identified complexity, experience, and text features as the main predictors of CR effort.

Conclusion: Machine learning provides a viable approach to understand and predict code review effort, emphasizing factors like code complexity, developer experience, and historical project characteristics.

Abstract: Code review (CR) is essential to software development, helping ensure that
new code is properly integrated. However, the CR process often involves
significant effort, including code adjustments, responses to reviewers, and
continued implementation. While past studies have examined CR delays and
iteration counts, few have investigated the effort based on the volume of code
changes required, especially in the context of GitLab Merge Requests (MRs),
which remains underexplored. In this paper, we define and measure CR effort as
the amount of code modified after submission, using a dataset of over 23,600
MRs from four GitLab projects. We find that up to 71% of MRs require
adjustments after submission, and 28% of these involve changes to more than 200
lines of code. Surprisingly, this effort is not correlated with review time or
the number of participants. To better understand and predict CR effort, we
train an interpretable machine learning model using metrics across multiple
dimensions: text features, code complexity, developer experience, review
history, and branching. Our model achieves strong performance (AUC 0.84-0.88)
and reveals that complexity, experience, and text features are key predictors.
Historical project characteristics also influence current review effort. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of using machine learning to explain and
anticipate the effort needed to integrate code changes during review.

### [297] [Place-cell heterogeneity underlies power-laws in hippocampal activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23030)
*John J. Briguglio,Jaesung Lee,Albert K. Lee,Vincent Hakim,Sandro Romani*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that power-law scaling in neural activity necessarily indicates critical dynamics. It demonstrates that such scaling can emerge from a clustering process applied to non-interacting heterogeneous units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate whether power-law scaling in neural activity unequivocally indicates critical dynamics or if other mechanisms may explain this phenomenon.

Method: The study analyzed neural activity data using a phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) method, applied to non-interacting heterogeneous units with spatially structured activity.

Result: Power-law scaling emerged solely from the PRG procedure itself, independent of critical dynamics, and the scaling exponents matched observed neural data. The analysis revealed that heterogeneity smooths transitions, producing an illusion of criticality.

Conclusion: The research concludes that power-law scaling can arise from the analysis method rather than criticality in neural activity, emphasizing the need to carefully interpret such scaling patterns.

Abstract: Power-law scaling in coarse-grained data suggests critical dynamics, but the
true source of this scaling often remains unclear. Here, we analyze neural
activity recorded during spatial navigation, reproducing power-law scaling
under a phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) procedure that clusters
units by activity similarity. Such scaling was previously linked to
criticality. Here, we show that the iterative nature of the procedure itself
leads to the emergence of power laws when applied to heterogeneous,
non-interacting units obeying spatially structured activity without requiring
critical interactions. Furthermore, the scaling exponents produced by
heteregeneous non-interacting units match the observed exponents in recorded
neural data. A simplified version of the PRG further reveals how heterogeneity
smooths transitions across scales, mimicking critical behavior. The resulting
exponents depend systematically on system and population size, predictions
confirmed by subsampling the data.

### [298] [Alpha-Z divergence unveils further distinct phenotypic traits of human brain connectivity fingerprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23116)
*Md Kaosar Uddin,Nghi Nguyen,Huajun Huang,Duy Duong-Tran,Jingyi Zheng*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence as a novel metric for comparing functional connectomes (FCs), enhancing identification accuracy in neuropsychiatric research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods, like Pearson's correlation, struggle with capturing FC data's complex geometry, resulting in subpar identification performance. Geodesic metrics, while better, are sensitive to regularization choices and task conditions.

Method: The authors propose a divergence-based distance metric, Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence, which is flexible, geometry-aware, and eliminates extensive parameter tuning. Comparisons were made against traditional and state-of-the-art distance metrics using the Human Connectome Project dataset.

Result: The new metric consistently outperformed traditional and geodesic methods, particularly in high-dimensional data, where matrix rank deficiencies are a challenge. It worked well across resting-state, task-based fMRI, and different parcellation schemes.

Conclusion: Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence provides a robust, generalizable framework for FC analysis, improving sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes, and overcoming limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs)
is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric
research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations
in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to
suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have
introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance
is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and
task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence,
which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison.
Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning
and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions
and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional
(e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g.,
affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically
investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance
performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the
proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional
and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied,
and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies
degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across
resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These
findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and
generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced
sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.

*David Papo,Javier M. Buldú*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores how brain network structure relates to brain disorders and recovery, suggesting network properties are linked to pathology and functional brain activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the connection between complex network structures in the brain and their role in both functional processes and diseases.

Method: The paper analyzes ways to represent brain pathology using network theory and explores links between disease definitions, functional activity, and network properties.

Result: The use of network properties offers insights into brain pathology, subjects' vulnerabilities, and recovery likelihood.

Conclusion: Understanding the "networkness" of brain diseases may enhance knowledge of brain pathology, functional brain activity, and result in clinical applications.

Abstract: If brain anatomy and dynamics have a genuine complex network structure as it
has become standard to posit, it is also reasonable to assume that such a
structure should play a key role not only in brain function but also in brain
dysfunction. However, exactly how network structure is implicated in brain
damage and whether at least some pathologies can be thought of as "network
diseases" is not entirely clear. Here we discuss ways in which a complex
network representation can help characterising brain pathology, but also
subjects' vulnerability to and likelihood of recovery from disease. We show how
the way disease is defined is related to the way function is defined and this,
in turn, determines which network property may be functionally relevant to
brain disease. Thus, addressing brain disease "networkness" may shed light not
only on brain pathology, with potential clinical implications, but also on
functional brain activity, and what is functional in it.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The authors address the instability and limited theoretical guarantees of the BWGD algorithm for phase retrieval, proposing a smoothing framework to ensure stability and rigorous superlinear convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The phase retrieval problem, specifically recovering a rank-one positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements, is hindered by instability and insufficient theoretical guarantees in existing BWGD approaches.

Method: The authors analyze BWGD as implementing Newton's method on a nonsmooth, nonconvex objective. They introduce a smoothing regularization framework to stabilize the objective function and ensure consistent results.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior stability while maintaining the fast convergence properties of the original BWGD algorithm, supported by experiments on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The smoothing approach resolves the theoretical and practical issues with BWGD, providing a stable and superlinear convergent method for phase retrieval.

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one
positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed
algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits
superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove
local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap
by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and
nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the
objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence
guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability
while maintaining fast convergence.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in individualized treatment rules (ITRs) influenced by sensitive attributes by proposing a method based on optimal transport theory to achieve demographic parity and introducing a trade-off approach to balance fairness and value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITRs have diverse applications, but they can lead to unfair outcomes when influenced by sensitive attributes like race, gender, or age, necessitating methods to ensure fairness.

Method: The authors use optimal transport theory to transform any optimal ITR into a fair ITR ensuring demographic parity. They also propose an improved trade-off method to adjust fairness levels and value optimization with a smoothed fairness constraint for parameter estimation.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates its potential through simulations and an application on the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

Conclusion: The study offers a flexible approach to implementing fairness in ITRs while balancing value optimization, supported by theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due
to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine,
ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced
by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes
where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this
gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory,
which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures
demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness
constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance
value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness
through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off
ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint
for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We
demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation
studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid framework for removing PHI/PII from DICOM files using rule-based methods, AI-driven techniques, and uncertainty checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The presence of PHI/PII in medical imaging files poses ethical and security issues, hindering the sharing of data for research and patient care advancements.

Method: The framework combines a two-tiered rule-based system, large language models fine-tuned for named entity recognition, and an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model for PHI/PII detection and removal.

Result: The framework demonstrated robust performance in complying with regulatory standards such as DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA, ensuring effective de-identification of medical data.

Conclusion: By integrating scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and quality assurance, the framework enables the secure and ethical sharing of medical imaging data for research without compromising patient privacy.

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive
major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the
presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable
Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of
imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework
developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines
rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification
for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit
and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model
(LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of
synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we
employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text,
extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the
NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification
provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation
reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage
residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance
across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and
TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty
quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical
challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical,
and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.

### [303] [Scaled Beta Models and Feature Dilution for Dynamic Ticket Pricing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23767)
*Jonathan R. Landers*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to classify artists in ticket resale markets using dynamic pricing distributions modeled as scaled Beta distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to identify unique economic signatures of performing acts through ticket pricing data in secondary resale markets, addressing the need to improve classification accuracy using robust statistical methods.

Method: They utilize SeatGeek API data to model ticket pricing as scaled Beta distributions, estimate parameters via hybrid quantile matching and the method of moments, and improve classification using Random Forest classifiers.

Result: Incorporating Beta distribution parameters into Random Forest classifiers enhances pairwise artist classification accuracy. Zero-variance features are shown to act as implicit regularizers, improving model performance and mitigating overfitting.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the economic uniqueness of event pricing and offers broader insights into robust modeling techniques, validated on both ticket and standard datasets.

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of
performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic
pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the
SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta
distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete
statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments.
Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest
classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy,
demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data.
Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating
zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an
implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This
regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving
the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features.
These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the
standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

### [304] [Formal Bayesian Transfer Learning via the Total Risk Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23768)
*Nathan Wycoff,Ali Arab,Lisa O. Singh*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Bayesian transfer learning approach that uses a joint prior distribution for statistical modeling, which enhances predictive performance in scenarios with limited source and target datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve statistical procedures in data-limited scenarios by utilizing ancillary datasets (source datasets) while addressing the challenges posed when these source datasets are themselves limited or poorly aligned with the target dataset.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that incorporates a single joint prior distribution for source and target parameters, enabling full Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The approach utilizes Gibbs sampling for model averaging and aligns with Bayesian Lasso in transformed coordinate systems.

Result: The proposed Bayesian method demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to frequentist methods, particularly when source data are scarce. The connection to minimax-frequentist techniques is also highlighted.

Conclusion: This approach provides a robust framework for transfer learning with data constraints, combining Bayesian principles with risk minimization to ensure better predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with
information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source
datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,
existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations
where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be
well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the
empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target
parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the
Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer
conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single
joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as
the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty
quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over
indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how
a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a
transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our
approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently
proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an
approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate
superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a
genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework using neural likelihood estimation to model detector energy response for neutrino experiments, integrating Bayesian sampling for precise parameter inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately modeling detector energy responses in neutrino experiments is critical but computationally challenging due to the absence of analytical likelihoods.

Method: The authors developed conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor to estimate likelihoods, integrated with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter tuning.

Result: They achieved statistically limited uncertainties with negligible systematic biases. Both unbinned (via normalizing flows) and binned (via transformer) analyses were supported, offering flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework is demonstrated on the JUNO experiment and is meant to serve as a versatile template for applications in neutrino and particle physics experiments.

Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation
neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of
analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood
estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two
complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration
data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt
JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of
JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their
non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this
end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for
parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with
near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned
likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned
alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to
choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach
establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino
and broader particle physics.

*Yixuan Mi,Yiduo Yu,Yiyi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: SmartCourse is an AI-driven academic advising tool integrating transcripts and four-year plans to enhance personalized course recommendations for undergraduate Computer Science students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional advising tools by incorporating individual transcript and plan data for more effective and contextual academic advising.

Method: SmartCourse integrates a command-line interface (CLI) and Gradio web GUI, manages various academic processes, and uses a locally hosted large language model to offer personalized, transcript-aware course recommendations.

Result: The system's recommendations were evaluated using 25 advising queries and four custom metrics, demonstrating that including transcript and plan context improves advising relevance and quality.

Conclusion: SmartCourse confirms the importance of transcript and academic plan integration in AI-driven advising systems, enhancing the relevance of academic planning and recommendations.

Abstract: We present SmartCourse, an integrated course management and AI-driven
advising system for undergraduate students (specifically tailored to the
Computer Science (CPS) major). SmartCourse addresses the limitations of
traditional advising tools by integrating transcript and plan information for
student-specific context. The system combines a command-line interface (CLI)
and a Gradio web GUI for instructors and students, manages user accounts,
course enrollment, grading, and four-year degree plans, and integrates a
locally hosted large language model (via Ollama) for personalized course
recommendations. It leverages transcript and major plan to offer contextual
advice (e.g., prioritizing requirements or retakes). We evaluated the system on
25 representative advising queries and introduced custom metrics: PlanScore,
PersonalScore, Lift, and Recall to assess recommendation quality across
different context conditions. Experiments show that using full context yields
substantially more relevant recommendations than context-omitted modes,
confirming the necessity of transcript and plan information for personalized
academic advising. SmartCourse thus demonstrates how transcript-aware AI can
enhance academic planning.

### [307] [ELMES: An Automated Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Educational Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22947)
*Shou'ang Wei,Xinyun Wang,Shuzhen Bi,Jian Chen,Ruijia Li,Bo Jiang,Xin Lin,Min Zhang,Yu Song,BingDong Li,Aimin Zhou,Hao Hao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELMES, an open-source framework for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings, addressing the lack of effective pedagogical evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of appropriate evaluation metrics for LLMs in educational scenarios, as current benchmarks emphasize general intelligence rather than pedagogical suitability.

Method: The paper presents ELMES, a modular, open-source framework for evaluating LLMs in education. It uses simple configuration files for flexible scenario design and incorporates a hybrid evaluation engine employing the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology.

Result: ELMES systematically benchmarks state-of-the-art LLMs across four educational scenarios, identifying context-specific strengths and limitations through fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with education experts.

Conclusion: ELMES reduces barriers for evaluating and applying LLMs in diverse educational settings, aiding educators and researchers in employing LLMs effectively in pedagogy. It is publicly available for use and collaboration.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative
opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios.
However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially
across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack
appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure
general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap,
we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular
architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues
through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design
without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a
hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective
pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic
benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational
scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching,
Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question
Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with
education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability
distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and
limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible
evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse
educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs
in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at
\emph{https://github.com/sii-research/elmes.git}.

### [308] [Automating AI Failure Tracking: Semantic Association of Reports in AI Incident Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23669)
*Diego Russo,Gian Marco Orlando,Valerio La Gatta,Vincenzo Moscato*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable framework for associating new AI failure reports with documented incidents using semantic similarity and transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual expert intervention for associating new AI failure reports limits scalability and delays detection of emerging failure patterns.

Method: The study formulates the task as a ranking problem, utilizing cosine similarity of embeddings from transformer-based models and combines titles and textual descriptions for improved performance.

Result: Transformer-based sentence embedding models outperformed traditional methods, and combining titles with descriptions improved ranking accuracy. Retrieval performance was robust and improved with larger training sets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the scalability and efficiency of maintaining the AI Incident Database and ensures reliable support for AI failure identification.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are transforming critical sectors such
as healthcare, finance, and transportation, enhancing operational efficiency
and decision-making processes. However, their deployment in high-stakes domains
has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To
systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident
Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure
reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident
relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the
identification of emerging failure patterns.
  To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that
automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through
semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where
each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to
previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity.
Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and
transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter
consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that
combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking
accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance
remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the
robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance
consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a
scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID.

### [309] [Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057)
*Triet M. Tran,Sina Khanmohammadi*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: Tumor-induced disruptions in neural dynamics before surgery can predict postoperative working memory decline, aiding personalized surgical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the relationship between tumor-induced neural changes and postoperative cognitive decline.

Method: Analyzed presurgical fMRI data; extracted energy landscapes; applied statistical and machine learning methods.

Result: Presurgical high-order energy features predicted memory decline with 90% accuracy, F1 score of 87.5%, and AUC of 0.95.

Conclusion: Energy landscapes can be used for predicting cognitive risks and enabling tailored surgical interventions.

Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients,
but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study
investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics
relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted
energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the
relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory
performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models.
Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but
more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas
patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts.
Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately
predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1
score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain
tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are
predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path
for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate
cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.

### [310] [DNN-based Methods of Jointly Sensing Number and Directions of Targets via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22906)
*Bin Deng,Jiatong Bai,Feilong Zhao,Zuming Xie,Maolin Li,Yan Wang,Feng Shu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper develops methods for intelligent emitter number and direction detection in the energy-efficient H2AD MIMO system, tackling issues in complexity and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern wireless networks demand energy-efficient and cost-effective solutions, with the H2AD MIMO system providing an alternative to fully-digital MIMO while addressing challenges like high energy use and complexity.

Method: A two-stage sensing framework is proposed, combining methods like improved eigen-domain clustering, enhanced deep neural networks, and 1D-CNN for emitter number detection, alongside the online micro-clustering method for DOA estimation.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate the methods' high accuracy in detecting multiple targets, particularly at moderate-to-high SNRs. The 1D-CNN method performs well under extremely-low SNR conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances the capability of H2AD MIMO systems by achieving reliable multi-emitter detection and outperforming existing DOA methods, paving the way for future wireless network improvements.

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO
architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or
extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to
address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy
consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to
intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a
structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a
two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction
values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods
are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced
deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an
improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full
eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is
achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.
Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under
multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation
results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets
sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior
under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing
clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

*Jun Won Park,Kangyu Zhao,Sanket Rane*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation-based inference framework using vision transformer-driven encoding to analyze complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods sacrifice complexity and interdependencies of spatiotemporal data for parameter identifiability, limiting understanding of generative mechanisms.

Method: A vision transformer-based variational encoding method generates latent representations of simulated dynamics, followed by a Bayesian approach for likelihood-free parameter inference.

Result: The framework constructs a mesh of latent embeddings to map observed data to parameter values, capturing spatiotemporal structures effectively.

Conclusion: This unified framework enhances mechanistic insights into complex biological systems by preserving data complexity and enabling reliable parameter inference.

Abstract: Biological systems commonly exhibit complex spatiotemporal patterns whose
underlying generative mechanisms pose a significant analytical challenge.
Traditional approaches to spatiodynamic inference rely on dimensionality
reduction through summary statistics, which sacrifice complexity and
interdependent structure intrinsic to these data in favor of parameter
identifiability. This imposes a fundamental constraint on reliably extracting
mechanistic insights from spatiotemporal data, highlighting the need for
analytical frameworks that preserve the full richness of these dynamical
systems. To address this, we developed a simulation-based inference framework
that employs vision transformer-driven variational encoding to generate compact
representations of the data, exploiting the inherent contextual dependencies.
These representations are subsequently integrated into a likelihood-free
Bayesian approach for parameter inference. The central idea is to construct a
fine-grained, structured mesh of latent representations from simulated dynamics
through systematic exploration of the parameter space. This encoded mesh of
latent embeddings then serves as a reference map for retrieving parameter
values that correspond to observed data. By integrating generative modeling
with Bayesian principles, our approach provides a unified inference framework
to identify both spatial and temporal patterns that manifest in multivariate
dynamical systems.

*Vincent Cohen-Addad,Alessandro Epasto,Jason Lee,Morteza Zadimoghaddam*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable distributed algorithm leveraging hypergraph modeling for enforcing user-level differential privacy in large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-level differential privacy becomes challenging in modern datasets due to multiple owners and contribution bounding requirements, where traditional sequential algorithms fail to scale efficiently.

Method: The proposed algorithm models users and records as hypergraphs, allowing parallel proposals and unanimous agreement from owners to ensure contribution limits are respected.

Result: The algorithm successfully balances high utility of the dataset and guarantees user-level privacy, overcoming scalability issues.

Conclusion: This novel approach provides a practical and efficient solution for enforcing privacy measures in massive real-world datasets.

Abstract: In modern datasets, where single records can have multiple owners, enforcing
user-level differential privacy requires capping each user's total
contribution. This "contribution bounding" becomes a significant combinatorial
challenge. Existing sequential algorithms for this task are computationally
intensive and do not scale to the massive datasets prevalent today. To address
this scalability bottleneck, we propose a novel and efficient distributed
algorithm. Our approach models the complex ownership structure as a hypergraph,
where users are vertices and records are hyperedges. The algorithm proceeds in
rounds, allowing users to propose records in parallel. A record is added to the
final dataset only if all its owners unanimously agree, thereby ensuring that
no user's predefined contribution limit is violated. This method aims to
maximize the size of the resulting dataset for high utility while providing a
practical, scalable solution for implementing user-level privacy in large,
real-world systems.

*Lijia Liu,Takumi Kondo,Kyohei Atarashi,Koh Takeuchi,Jiyi Li,Shigeru Saito,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses prompt injection threats in LLM-based evaluations, proposing a defense framework combining Standard Evaluation with Counterfactual Evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt injection attacks disrupt the reliability of LLM-based evaluation systems, necessitating robust defenses to maintain system integrity.

Method: The authors introduce a framework combining Standard Evaluation with Counterfactual Evaluation, re-evaluating submissions against false ground-truth answers to detect attacks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved security and attack detection using the proposed framework, with negligible performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: The SE+CFE framework enhances security of LLM-based evaluation systems against blind prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: This paper investigates defenses for LLM-based evaluation systems against
prompt injection. We formalize a class of threats called blind attacks, where a
candidate answer is crafted independently of the true answer to deceive the
evaluator. To counter such attacks, we propose a framework that augments
Standard Evaluation (SE) with Counterfactual Evaluation (CFE), which
re-evaluates the submission against a deliberately false ground-truth answer.
An attack is detected if the system validates an answer under both standard and
counterfactual conditions. Experiments show that while standard evaluation is
highly vulnerable, our SE+CFE framework significantly improves security by
boosting attack detection with minimal performance trade-offs.

### [314] [LLM-Based Identification of Infostealer Infection Vectors from Screenshots: The Case of Aurora](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23611)
*Estelle Ruellan,Eric Clay,Nicholas Ascoli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze infection screenshots from infostealers, identifying Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and mapping malware campaigns, particularly for Aurora infostealer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of manual analysis for the vast amount of stealer logs and fill the gap in reactive analysis of infection artifacts, specifically screenshots.

Method: Utilize gpt-4o-mini LLM to process infection screenshots to extract actionable IoCs, categorize infection vectors, and identify malware campaigns.

Result: Through the analysis of 1000 screenshots, the method identified 337 actionable URLs, 246 relevant files, and uncovered three distinct malware campaigns.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the utility of LLM-driven analysis of infection screenshots as a scalable and actionable approach for malware analysis, fostering better threat intelligence and intervention efforts.

Abstract: Infostealers exfiltrate credentials, session cookies, and sensitive data from
infected systems. With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual
analysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While
most research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains
in leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.
Specifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the
point of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This
paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more
specifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential
Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.
Focusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process
screenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer
files, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs
and 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware
distribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted
filenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware
campaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering
infection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence. By shifting malware
analysis from traditional log-based detection methods to a reactive,
artifact-driven approach that leverages infection screenshots, this research
presents a scalable method for identifying infection vectors and enabling early
intervention.

*Fatimah Rita Ahmadi*

Main category: math.CT

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for linear algebra using category theory, extending to tensors in semiadditive 2-categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to create a formalized, index-free framework for efficient and parallelized linear algebra computations, leveraging functional programming and category theory.

Method: They treat matrices as morphisms in the category of matrices and generalize them to monoidal semiadditive categories. They further extend the framework to semiadditive 2-categories for tensors and apply it to 2Vec.

Result: The study establishes an enhanced theoretical framework for linear algebra, accommodating matrices and tensors in a categorical setting, with detailed operations illustrated in 2Vec.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a typed, index-free formalization of linear algebra, advancing computational efficiency and compatibility with functional programming.

Abstract: To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient
algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and
faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of
linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices,
$\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$. This framework is further extended by generalizing the
results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this
perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define
semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices $T_{ij}$ are represented as
1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices $T_{ijkl}$ as 2-morphisms. This
formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that
includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend
the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed
operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by
Kapranov and Voevodsky.

*Oliver Bause,Julia Werner,Paul Palomero Bernardo,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper focuses on an energy-efficient AI solution for image classification on low-power sensor edge devices, particularly in medical video capsule endoscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional deep neural networks in image classification on resource-constrained low-power sensor edge devices, especially in medical applications like video capsule endoscopy.

Method: A neural network with 63,000 parameters is used for image classification directly on Bayer images, combined with Viterbi decoding for time-series analysis and demonstrated on a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with RISC-V and ultra-low power hardware.

Result: The method achieves an organ classification accuracy of 93.06%, using only 5.31 μJ per image, and saves an average of 89.9% of energy in the video capsule compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: This energy-efficient AI approach is feasible for resource-limited devices and significantly reduces energy consumption, making it suitable for applications like medical video capsule endoscopy.

Abstract: For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep
neural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is
due to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often
exceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,
camera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which
are subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural
network training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions
demands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This
work ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge
devices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-
dure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by
its battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final
accuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with
only 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi
decoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image
processing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a
RISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an
energy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31
{\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of
energy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning framework for improving automated neuron segmentation and topology reconstruction, overcoming challenges of intricate neuronal morphology and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuron segmentation plays a critical role in analyzing large-scale neuroimaging datasets, but existing methods struggle with complex neuronal structures and occlusions.

Method: The paper proposes a deep network outputting pixel-level embeddings with a specialized loss function, an end-to-end pipeline for mapping raw images to neuron trees, and a novel topological metric for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces neuronal topology reconstruction errors on the fMOST imaging dataset compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The improved framework effectively addresses challenges in automated neuron segmentation, enabling more accurate and scalable neuron analysis.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large
scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and
analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the
occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based
segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First,
we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and
design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to
effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions.
Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly
maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally,
recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation
accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more
appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction.
Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several
classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in
neuronal topology reconstruction.

TL;DR: PancreasDG introduces a large-scale 3D MRI dataset for domain generalization in pancreas segmentation, addressing variability across acquisition sites and sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pancreas segmentation in medical imaging, especially given the organ's challenging characteristics and clinical significance.

Method: PancreasDG compiles a dataset from six institutions with pixel-accurate masks and employs a semi-supervised approach utilizing anatomical invariances.

Result: Significant improvements were achieved in segmenting the pancreas, outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization methods with up to 61.63% Dice score.

Conclusion: PancreasDG establishes a robust benchmark for domain generalization in medical imaging and highlights key challenges and solutions in cross-sequence variability.

Abstract: Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences
whose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.
Existing domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts
and overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains
a major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,
surrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.
State-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or
kidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically
under-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical
importance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close
this gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas
segmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical
imaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning
both venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both
cross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks
created by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,
we reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance
that may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance
correlates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)
cross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a
semi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%
Dice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence
segmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in
medical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at

*Philip Wootaek Shin,Vishal Gaur,Rahul Ramachandran,Manil Maskey,Jack Sampson,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan,Sujit Roy*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study develops a framework for harmonizing and enhancing resolution in satellite imagery, particularly between Landsat and Sentinel datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variations in spatial resolution across satellite sensors complicate geospatial data fusion and analysis, necessitating methods to bridge these gaps.

Method: The framework aligns and super-resolves 30m Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS30) imagery using higher-resolution (10m) HLS imagery as a reference.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the method's effectiveness in improving resolution and data quality for Landsat imagery.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of satellite image super-resolution using heterogeneous sensors, with implications for future geospatial and sensing applications.

Abstract: High-resolution satellite imagery is essential for geospatial analysis, yet
differences in spatial resolution across satellite sensors present challenges
for data fusion and downstream applications. Super-resolution techniques can
help bridge this gap, but existing methods rely on artificially downscaled
images rather than real sensor data and are not well suited for heterogeneous
satellite sensors with differing spectral, temporal characteristics. In this
work, we develop a preliminary framework to align and Harmonized Landsat
Sentinel 30m(HLS 30) imagery using Harmonized Landsat Sentinel 10m(HLS10) as a
reference from the HLS dataset. Our approach aims to bridge the resolution gap
between these sensors and improve the quality of super-resolved Landsat
imagery. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, showing its potential for enhancing satellite-based sensing
applications. This study provides insights into the feasibility of
heterogeneous satellite image super-resolution and highlights key
considerations for future advancements in the field.

*Jamil Fayyad,Nourhan Bayasi,Ziyang Yu,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents LesionGen, a framework using text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs) to synthesize dermatology images with realistic and diverse skin lesion depictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large, diverse, and well-annotated dermatological datasets hinders the development of deep learning models for skin disease classification.

Method: LesionGen uses structured, concept-rich dermatological captions based on expert annotations and pseudo-generated reports to fine-tune a pretrained diffusion model for generating meaningful dermatology images.

Result: Synthetic datasets generated with LesionGen enable models to achieve classification accuracy comparable to those trained on real images, with improved performance in difficult subgroups.

Conclusion: LesionGen highlights the potential for using T2I-DPM frameworks in dermatology to overcome dataset limitations, facilitating realistic synthetic image generation for classification and improved subgroup performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models for skin disease classification require large, diverse,
and well-annotated datasets. However, such resources are often limited due to
privacy concerns, high annotation costs, and insufficient demographic
representation. While text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models (T2I-DPMs)
offer promise for medical data synthesis, their use in dermatology remains
underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of rich textual descriptions in
existing skin image datasets. In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a
clinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis. Unlike
prior methods that rely on simplistic disease labels, LesionGen is trained on
structured, concept-rich dermatological captions derived from expert
annotations and pseudo-generated, concept-guided reports. By fine-tuning a
pretrained diffusion model on these high-quality image-caption pairs, we enable
the generation of realistic and diverse skin lesion images conditioned on
meaningful dermatological descriptions. Our results demonstrate that models
trained solely on our synthetic dataset achieve classification accuracy
comparable to those trained on real images, with notable gains in worst-case
subgroup performance. Code and data are available here.

### [322] [Learning Arbitrary-Scale RAW Image Downscaling with Wavelet-based Recurrent Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23219)
*Yang Ren,Hai Jiang,Wei Li,Menglong Yang,Heng Zhang,Zehua Sheng,Qingsheng Ye,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes a wavelet-based method for arbitrary-scale downscaling of RAW images, overcoming artifacts and blur found in sRGB approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on sRGB downscaling, which results in blurred details and artifacts. RAW images offer more flexibility but lack robust downscaling frameworks.

Method: Introduces a wavelet-based recurrent reconstruction framework employing LASDM and HFPM modules, alongside energy-maximization loss, to ensure structural and textural fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved performance over state-of-the-art methods, quantitatively and visually.

Conclusion: The framework efficiently downscales RAW images with better integrity compared to existing methods, providing benchmarks and resources for further research.

Abstract: Image downscaling is critical for efficient storage and transmission of
high-resolution (HR) images. Existing learning-based methods focus on
performing downscaling within the sRGB domain, which typically suffers from
blurred details and unexpected artifacts. RAW images, with their unprocessed
photonic information, offer greater flexibility but lack specialized
downscaling frameworks. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based recurrent
reconstruction framework that leverages the information lossless attribute of
wavelet transformation to fulfill the arbitrary-scale RAW image downscaling in
a coarse-to-fine manner, in which the Low-Frequency Arbitrary-Scale Downscaling
Module (LASDM) and the High-Frequency Prediction Module (HFPM) are proposed to
preserve structural and textural integrity of the reconstructed low-resolution
(LR) RAW images, alongside an energy-maximization loss to align high-frequency
energy between HR and LR domain. Furthermore, we introduce the Realistic
Non-Integer RAW Downscaling (Real-NIRD) dataset, featuring a non-integer
downscaling factor of 1.3$\times$, and incorporate it with publicly available
datasets with integer factors (2$\times$, 3$\times$, 4$\times$) for
comprehensive benchmarking arbitrary-scale image downscaling purposes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art competitors both quantitatively and visually. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/RenYangSCU/ASRD.

*Ahmed Jaheen,Abdelrahman Elsayed,Damir Kim,Daniil Tikhonov,Matheus Scatolin,Mohor Banerjee,Qiankun Ji,Mostafa Salem,Hu Wang,Sarim Hashmi,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces EMedNeXt, a framework for glioma tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa's resource-constrained healthcare systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of inaccurate, time-consuming, and resource-intensive tumor segmentation in MRI scans, particularly in low-income regions like sub-Saharan Africa, where healthcare resources and expert radiologists are scarce.

Method: The research developed EMedNeXt, an enhanced segmentation framework. This system is based on MedNeXt V2 and employs methodologies like deep supervision, a nnU-Net V2-based architecture, a larger region of interest, and robust model ensembling systems.

Result: EMedNeXt achieved high accuracy levels, with an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 and an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at tolerances of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Conclusion: EMedNeXt demonstrates a robust and optimized approach for accurate brain tumor segmentation in resource-constrained settings, highlighting its potential to transform glioma diagnostics and care in low-resource regions.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical
setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and
monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through
manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert
radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.
This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners
are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect
segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans
in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse
2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce
significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain
tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and
optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three
key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based
architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the
hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897
with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and
1.0 mm, respectively.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces JPNeO, a next-gen JPEG algorithm compatible with the current JPEG format, improving performance in image compression and artifact removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardizing learning-based lossy compression codecs is challenging, and there's a need for improved compatibility and reconstruction fidelity in image compression.

Method: Incorporates neural operators into JPEG encoding and decoding stages for enhanced chroma preservation and reconstruction fidelity, with reduced memory usage and parameters.

Result: JPNeO shows improved chroma component preservation, reduced memory footprint, and high reconstruction fidelity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The JPNeO functions as an efficient image compression pipeline without altering source coding protocols.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in learning-based lossy compression algorithms,
standardizing codecs remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present
the JPEG Processing Neural Operator (JPNeO), a next-generation JPEG algorithm
that maintains full backward compatibility with the current JPEG format. Our
JPNeO improves chroma component preservation and enhances reconstruction
fidelity compared to existing artifact removal methods by incorporating neural
operators in both the encoding and decoding stages. JPNeO achieves practical
benefits in terms of reduced memory usage and parameter count. We further
validate our hypothesis about the existence of a space with high mutual
information through empirical evidence. In summary, the JPNeO functions as a
high-performance out-of-the-box image compression pipeline without changing
source coding's protocol. Our source code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores using continual learning (CL) strategies to improve the adaptability and robustness of malaria diagnostic models for thin blood smear images across varying acquisition conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of deploying deep learning-based malaria CAD systems in low-resource settings with differing site conditions, where models often struggle to generalize effectively.

Method: Continual learning techniques, including rehearsal-based and regularization-based methods, are applied to train a YOLO-based object detector on a multi-site clinical dataset, aiming to adapt to new conditions while retaining performance on previous domains.

Result: Rehearsal-based continual learning methods significantly enhance the model's diagnostic performance across sites with domain shifts.

Conclusion: Continual learning can play a key role in enhancing malaria CAD models, making them more suitable for deployment in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert microscopy may be limited. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate
promising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical
deployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying
conditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,
we investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness
of malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a
domain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must
adapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen
domains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two
regularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site
clinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and
rehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.
These findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the
development of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.

### [326] [Topology Optimization in Medical Image Segmentation with Fast Euler Characteristic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23763)
*Liu Li,Qiang Ma,Cheng Ouyang,Johannes C. Paetzold,Daniel Rueckert,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Automatic medical image segmentation methods excel in pixel-wise accuracy but ignore topology. This paper introduces a fast Euler Characteristic-based approach to enforce topological constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation techniques often fail to meet clinical accuracy when topology, such as continuity or closed surfaces, is crucial.

Method: The paper proposes a fast calculation of Euler Characteristic ($\chi$), a topological metric, and uses a violation map to refine results with a correction network.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate improved topological correctness without sacrificing pixel-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach ensures clinically-relevant topology in segmentation while maintaining traditional accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown
promising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice
score or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often
fail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological
constraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.
In medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of
the required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the
pixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and
constrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology
(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional
data due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this
problem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation
based on the Euler Characteristic ($\chi$). First, we propose a fast
formulation for $\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\chi$ error
between the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation
metric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation
network via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that
highlights regions with $\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from
the arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a
topology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and
3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological
correctness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper introduces dynamic polar parameters from spectral subband centroids for enhancing Vietnamese ASR performance, combined with MFCCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by better capturing the dynamic and tonal characteristics of Vietnamese speech.

Method: Use polar parameters of Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) and integrate them with MFCCs while applying SSCF0 as a pseudo-feature for tonal robustness.

Result: Proposed parameters reduced word error rates and demonstrated gender independence when compared to baseline MFCCs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures dynamic and tonal speech features, significantly enhancing Vietnamese ASR performance.

Abstract: The dynamic characteristics of speech signal provides temporal information
and play an important role in enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). In
this work, we characterized the acoustic transitions in a ratio plane of
Spectral Subband Centroid Frequencies (SSCFs) using polar parameters to capture
the dynamic characteristics of the speech and minimize spectral variation.
These dynamic parameters were combined with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) in Vietnamese ASR to capture more detailed spectral information. The
SSCF0 was used as a pseudo-feature for the fundamental frequency (F0) to
describe the tonal information robustly. The findings showed that the proposed
parameters significantly reduce word error rates and exhibit greater gender
independence than the baseline MFCCs.

*Yadong Niu,Tianzi Wang,Heinrich Dinkel,Xingwei Sun,Jiahao Zhou,Gang Li,Jizhong Liu,Xunying Liu,Junbo Zhang,Jian Luan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Recent work introduces MECAT, a refined benchmark and metric system aimed at improving fine-grained audio-language model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-language models lack nuanced understanding due to poor data annotations and evaluation metrics that fail to differentiate between generic and detailed outputs.

Method: MECAT combines expert model analyses with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to generate detailed captions and QA pairs, paired with the DATE metric to reward specificity in descriptions.

Result: The authors assessed state-of-the-art audio models using MECAT, revealing gaps in their capabilities and providing insights into their limitations.

Conclusion: MECAT and the DATE metric improve evaluation by promoting fine-grained distinctions in audio-language model outputs, enhancing benchmarks for future studies.

Abstract: While large audio-language models have advanced open-ended audio
understanding, they still fall short of nuanced human-level comprehension. This
gap persists largely because current benchmarks, limited by data annotations
and evaluation metrics, fail to reliably distinguish between generic and highly
detailed model outputs. To this end, this work introduces MECAT, a Multi-Expert
Constructed Benchmark for Fine-Grained Audio Understanding Tasks. Generated via
a pipeline that integrates analysis from specialized expert models with
Chain-of-Thought large language model reasoning, MECAT provides
multi-perspective, fine-grained captions and open-set question-answering pairs.
The benchmark is complemented by a novel metric: DATE (Discriminative-Enhanced
Audio Text Evaluation). This metric penalizes generic terms and rewards
detailed descriptions by combining single-sample semantic similarity with
cross-sample discriminability. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art
audio models is also presented, providing new insights into their current
capabilities and limitations. The data and code are available at

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o can be combined with graph structures to improve community detection in social networks, achieving promising results in small to medium-sized graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance community detection in social networks by integrating both semantic/contextual information from LLMs and traditional graph structural properties.

Method: The paper introduces 'CommLLM,' a two-step framework that combines GPT-4o outputs with graph structural data using prompt-based reasoning. Six real-world datasets and performance metrics like NMI, ARI, VOI, and cluster purity are used for evaluation.

Result: Results indicate that LLMs, when paired with graph-aware strategies, are effective for community detection, especially in small to medium-sized graphs. Tailored prompts and instruction-tuned models enhance accuracy and coherence.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant potential in graph-based tasks when adapted to the structure and requirements of graph data, suggesting a promising avenue for further exploration in fusing LLMs with graph-theoretical techniques.

Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering
group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional
methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic
and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed
investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying
communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called
CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to
fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on
six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics
such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI),
Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that
LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully
applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We
observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully
engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of
detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs
in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model
interactions to the specific structure of graph data.

TL;DR: AutoIndexer enhances database performance by reducing search complexity using workload compression and RL models, outperforming prior approaches in efficiency and cost savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Index selection is critical for optimizing database performance, but scaling challenges arise in analytical workloads due to large action spaces and time-intensive trial-and-error learning in RL-based methods.

Method: The proposed framework, AutoIndexer, integrates workload compression, query optimization, and specialized reinforcement learning models to reduce search complexity while maintaining high index quality.

Result: AutoIndexer reduces query execution time by up to 95% compared to non-indexed systems, delivers approximately 20% cost savings over state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors, and cuts tuning time by more than 50%.

Conclusion: AutoIndexer demonstrates significant practical value for handling large and diverse workloads, offering an efficient solution for scaling index selection in databases.

Abstract: Efficiently selecting indexes is fundamental to database performance
optimization, particularly for systems handling large-scale analytical
workloads. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in
automating index selection through its ability to learn from experience, few
works address how these RL-based index advisors can adapt to scaling workloads
due to exponentially growing action spaces and heavy trial and error. To
address these challenges, we introduce AutoIndexer, a framework that combines
workload compression, query optimization, and specialized RL models to scale
index selection effectively. By operating on compressed workloads, AutoIndexer
substantially lowers search complexity without sacrificing much index quality.
Extensive evaluations show that it reduces end-to-end query execution time by
up to 95% versus non-indexed baselines. On average, it outperforms
state-of-the-art RL-based index advisors by approximately 20% in workload cost
savings while cutting tuning time by over 50%. These results affirm
AutoIndexer's practicality for large and diverse workloads.

TL;DR: The paper addresses dimensionality reduction for unlabeled networks by proposing Barycentric Subspace Analysis (BSA) as an interpretable alternative to PCA-based methods, using cospectral equivalence for computational feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve interpretability of dimensionality reduction techniques for unlabeled network data, a limitation in current PCA-based methods, which rely on vector-based subspaces.

Method: The paper introduces BSA, leveraging point-generated subspaces instead of vector-based ones, and proposes a new embedding technique that uses equivalence classes of cospectral networks for computational efficiency.

Result: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of BSA on both simulated and real-world datasets, showing its potential as a robust alternative to tangent PCA.

Conclusion: BSA presents a more interpretable and computationally feasible approach to dimensionality reduction for unlabeled networks, addressing limitations of PCA-derived methods.

Abstract: Certain data are naturally modeled by networks or weighted graphs, be they
arterial networks or mobility networks. When there is no canonical labeling of
the nodes across the dataset, we talk about unlabeled networks. In this paper,
we focus on the question of dimensionality reduction for this type of data.
More specifically, we address the issue of interpreting the feature subspace
constructed by dimensionality reduction methods. Most existing methods for
network-valued data are derived from principal component analysis (PCA) and
therefore rely on subspaces generated by a set of vectors, which we identify as
a major limitation in terms of interpretability. Instead, we propose to
implement the method called barycentric subspace analysis (BSA), which relies
on subspaces generated by a set of points. In order to provide a
computationally feasible framework for BSA, we introduce a novel embedding for
unlabeled networks where we replace their usual representation by equivalence
classes of isomorphic networks with that by equivalence classes of cospectral
networks. We then illustrate BSA on simulated and real-world datasets, and
compare it to tangent PCA.

Motivation: The motivation is to ensure topic models are used responsibly and provide accurate interpretations, addressing concerns of them being treated as a black box.

Method: The research utilized 1140 runs of BERTopic model to evaluate parameter optimizations and assess impacts on interpretation.

Result: The study revealed key trade-offs in model parameter settings that affect the accuracy and reliability of topic model outcomes.

Conclusion: Topic models require careful parameter selection and understanding to ensure their outputs are meaningful and responsibly used by users.

Abstract: Topic models are gaining increasing commercial and academic interest for
their ability to summarize large volumes of unstructured text. As unsupervised
machine learning methods, they enable researchers to explore data and help
general users understand key themes in large text collections. However, they
risk becoming a 'black box', where users input data and accept the output as an

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the self-awareness of recommendation models through uncertainty quantification using a novel method called List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu), validating its efficacy with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable recommender systems to self-assess and provide label-free estimation of their performance, aiding in informed decision-making before user engagement.

Method: The study introduces LiDu, an intuitive method quantifying uncertainty by evaluating the probability of generating specific ranking lists using prediction distributions of individual items. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: LiDu demonstrated higher correlation with recommendation performance compared to other label-free estimators and offered insights into model states during training and inference.

Conclusion: LiDu establishes a connection between recommendation uncertainty and performance, marking progress toward transparent and self-evaluative recommender systems.

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the
recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a
label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more
informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with
any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,
probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures
uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a
certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.
We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:
(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with
popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results
show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series
of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable
insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and
inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation
uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and
self-evaluating recommender systems.

Motivation: Current approaches to sequential recommendation tasks often ignore dynamic time intervals between item interactions, which offer critical insights into user profiling and behavior.

Method: The authors propose IntervalLLM, which integrates interval information into LLMs using interval-infused attention. They propose a new evaluation metric: the interval perspective for warm and cold scenarios.

Result: The framework achieves a 4.4% average improvement and outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across benchmark datasets, excelling in both warm and cold scenarios from user, item, and interval perspectives.

Conclusion: Dynamic interval modeling is crucial for enhancing sequential recommendation tasks, particularly under cold-start conditions. IntervalLLM highlights the need for deeper research into interval-based cold-start challenges.

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential
recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and
often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However,
dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not
only the history within a user but also different users with the same item
history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that
integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel
interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and
intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start
scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new
viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for
evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive
experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines
demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average
but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items,
and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold
scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant
performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the
necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our
integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation
tasks. Our code is available here:

### [335] [KLAN: Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23459)
*Fan Li,Chang Meng,Jiaqi Fu,Shuchang Liu,Jiashuo Zhang,Tianke Zhang,Xueliang Wang,Xiaoqiang Feng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Personalized Landing Page Modeling (PLPM) and proposes the KLAN framework to optimize landing page selection for improved metrics like Daily Active Users and user Lifetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on improving in-page interaction, but little attention is given to optimizing users' navigation to landing pages upon entry.

Method: The authors propose KLAN, a hierarchical framework including three components: KLAN-ISP for static preferences, KLAN-IIT for dynamic interest transitions, and KLAN-AM to combine these components for better navigation decisions.

Result: Online experiments on the Kuaishou platform show that KLAN improved Daily Active Users by +0.205% and user Lifetime by +0.192%, and it has been deployed across full traffic.

Conclusion: The proposed KLAN framework effectively boosts platform engagement metrics and holds promise for widespread application, with plans to release the dataset and code to encourage future research.

Abstract: Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user
needs. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage
interaction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page
navigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page
interaction, where users engage with customized content within the specific
page. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential
recommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been
little investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To
fill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page
Modeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app
entry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page
from a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or
aggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user
engagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.
Additionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a
hierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages
under the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)
KLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures
intra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates
both components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments
conducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,
obtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and
user Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at
full traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users. To promote further
research in this important area, we will release our dataset and code upon
paper acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) into agent-based geosimulation platforms, confirming their alignment with a structured framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize a framework for geosimulation platforms and investigate the integration of LLMs for enhanced multi-agent system simulations.

Method: Examined two decades of research and proposed an architecture for integrating LLMs based on structured agent activities like perception, memory, planning, and action.

Result: Findings confirm that LLMs can be incorporated effectively into multi-agent geosimulation systems using a structured architecture.

Conclusion: LLM integration aligns with the formalized architecture, paving the way for advanced geosimulation platforms.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify
the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and
information systems. Based on two decades of study, this paper confirms a
framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our
findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated
as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to
fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.
This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we
formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation
systems.

### [337] [Noise-Coded Illumination for Forensic and Photometric Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23002)
*Peter F. Michael,Zekun Hao,Serge Belongie,Abe Davis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method of embedding subtle modulations in scene illumination to make fake videos harder to create, by creating an asymmetric information advantage favoring verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing difficulty of distinguishing manipulated fake videos from real ones, due to the increasing sophistication of video manipulation techniques.

Method: The authors propose coding noise-like modulations into scene illumination to create a temporal watermark. This watermark encodes an image of the original, unaltered scene as it would appear under the coded illumination.

Result: The encoded illumination makes it more challenging for adversaries to produce fake videos that remain consistent with the temporal watermark, giving defenders an edge in exposing manipulation.

Conclusion: This method offers a promising solution for protecting high-stakes video content, such as during public events and interviews, where illumination can be controlled but not the cameras.

Abstract: The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms
race, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to
detect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this
race, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real
ones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those
manipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider
authentic (i.e., "natural") video. In this paper, we show how coding very
subtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat
this advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.
Our approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under
coded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this
watermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit
only by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that
our technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to
solving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content
creation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for
protecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the
content on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the
illumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.

*Dian Chen,Yansong Qu,Xinyang Li,Ming Li,Shengchuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: XSpecMesh accelerates auto-regressive mesh generation models using speculative decoding, achieving faster inference without compromising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-regressive mesh generation models offer high-quality outputs but suffer from high latency due to the need for many next-token predictions.

Method: XSpecMesh implements multi-head speculative decoding for parallel token prediction, coupled with verification, resampling strategies, and distillation from the backbone model.

Result: The method achieves a 1.7x speedup in inference while maintaining mesh generation quality, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: XSpecMesh reduces latency while preserving output quality, offering a robust solution to accelerate auto-regressive mesh generation models.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically
precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of
thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial
latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for
auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,
multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel
within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further
propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies
each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality
criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the
lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging
their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of
speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will
be released.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an enhanced algorithm to efficiently identify high-performing transparent conducting materials (TCMs) for next-gen devices like solar cells and displays, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for better transparent conducting materials to improve device performance and reduce costs in applications such as solar cells and displays.

Method: The researchers enhance a Factorization Machine and annealing framework by introducing binarization of continuous variables, using a Hopfield network for solution refinement, adaptive random flips for global search, and local fine-tuning via bit-string search.

Result: The presented method achieves faster and more accurate searches compared to Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms and effectively handles multi-objective optimization for designing materials with balanced band gap and formation energy.

Conclusion: The proposed technique is expected to push the boundaries of materials informatics by tackling complex and realistic searches, driving innovation in material design for practical applications.

Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential
for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices
such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which
combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal
compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The
proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii)
the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the
activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning
via a bit-string local search. Validation using the
(Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting
Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves
faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic
algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed
its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the
band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method
to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that
reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the
further advancement of materials informatics.

*Chiara Lambranzi,Giulia Oberti,Christian Di Natali,Darwin G. Caldwell,Manuela Galli,Elena De Momi,Jesùs Ortiz*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: Anchor point placement in exosuits significantly impacts energy consumption, muscle activity, and gait kinematics. Different configurations have varying effects depending on individual characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate how anchor point placement in exosuits impacts gait, muscular activation, and metabolism, areas which are often overlooked but critical for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of such systems.

Method: Six experiments were conducted with 11 subjects wearing an exosuit assisting hip flexion in five configurations. IMU systems, EMG sensors, and metabolic masks were used for data collection.

Result: Positioning the knee anchor at the posterior and hip anchor at the anterior reduced hip flexor muscle activation by up to 10.21% and metabolic expenditure by up to 18.45%. Anchor points also influenced knee and ankle movements.

Conclusion: Anchor point placement substantially affects exosuit outcomes, but no universal configuration works for all individuals. Personalized designs and tailored musculoskeletal models are essential for optimization and clinical adoption.

Abstract: Anchor point placement is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of exosuit
design since it determines how forces interact with the human body. This work
analyzes the impact of different anchor point positions on gait kinematics,
muscular activation and energetic consumption. A total of six experiments were
conducted with 11 subjects wearing the XoSoft exosuit, which assists hip
flexion in five configurations. Subjects were instrumented with an IMU-based
motion tracking system, EMG sensors, and a mask to measure metabolic
consumption. The results show that positioning the knee anchor point on the
posterior side while keeping the hip anchor on the anterior part can reduce
muscle activation in the hip flexors by up to 10.21\% and metabolic expenditure
by up to 18.45\%. Even if the only assisted joint was the hip, all the
configurations introduced changes also in the knee and ankle kinematics.
Overall, no single configuration was optimal across all subjects, suggesting
that a personalized approach is necessary to transmit the assistance forces
optimally. These findings emphasize that anchor point position does indeed have
a significant impact on exoskeleton effectiveness and efficiency. However,
these optimal positions are subject-specific to the exosuit design, and there
is a strong need for future work to tailor musculoskeletal models to individual
characteristics and validate these results in clinical populations.

TL;DR: The author shares their experience of creating two AI music albums and uses an LLM to interview themselves, exploring authorship, identity, and creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The author aims to investigate the role of AI in creative processes, focusing on musical identity and authorship in the context of state-of-the-art AI music generators.

Method: The author produces two music albums using AI music generation platforms, seeds an LLM with information about these works, and uses it to conduct a self-interview.

Result: The author uncovers deeper questions about authorship, identity, and new creative spaces, reflecting on the influence of AI on musical creation.

Conclusion: The study concludes with a contemplation on the value of LLM-mediated self-reflection as a method to interrogate complex issues of creativity and identity in the age of AI.

Abstract: I reflect on my experience creating two music albums centered on
state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation platforms. The first album
explicitly poses the question: What happens when I collide my junk mail with
these platforms? The second album is a direct response to the first, and toys
with the inability of state-of-the-art prompt-based AI music generation
platforms to generate music that is not ``practiced'', ``polished'', and
``produced''. I seed a large language model (LLM) with information about these
albums and have it interview me, which results in the exploration of several
deeper questions: To what extent am I the author? Where am I in the resulting
music? How is my musical identity changing as I am faced with machines that are
in some ways far more talented than I? What new musical spaces does my work
open, for me or anyone/thing else? I conclude by reflecting on my reflections,
as well as LLM-mediated self-reflection as method.

*Lloyd Fung*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: ODR-BINDy introduces a novel equation discovery method that outperforms existing techniques in handling noise and sparse datasets, validated on chaotic systems like Lorenz63.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like SINDy struggle with noisy datasets due to assumptions about the distribution of noise in regressors and regressands.

Method: ODR-BINDy combines orthogonal distance regression (ODR) with a Bayesian framework, treating model equations as soft constraints to account for numerical errors.

Result: Using case studies like Lorenz63, Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems, ODR-BINDy reliably recovers governing equations even under high noise contamination levels.

Conclusion: ODR-BINDy has superior performance in equation discovery from noisy and sparse data compared to existing methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO.

Abstract: Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that
promise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there
remain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One
reason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all
noise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time
derivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors).
Recent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable
problem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they
are also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes
no error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents
assimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the
model equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small
yet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in
both the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance
regression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model
selection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy,
and assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63,
Rossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that
ODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the
correct model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy
method reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise
contamination levels of up to 30%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address increasing fraudulent activities due to digital transaction growth, as traditional methods are insufficient.

Method: Integration of quantum layers in LSTM for complex pattern detection, coupled with "FedRansel" for enhanced privacy and mitigation of attacks in federated learning.

Result: Improved fraud detection with ~5% better performance metrics and 4-8% reduction in model degradation and inference accuracy loss compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced federated learning can significantly enhance fraud detection while ensuring privacy and security of financial data.

Abstract: Rapid growth of digital transactions has led to a surge in fraudulent
activities, challenging traditional detection methods in the financial sector.
To tackle this problem, we introduce a specialised federated learning framework
that uniquely combines a quantum-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
with advanced privacy preserving techniques. By integrating quantum layers into
the LSTM architecture, our approach adeptly captures complex
cross-transactional patters, resulting in an approximate 5% performance
improvement across key evaluation metrics compared to conventional models.
Central to our framework is "FedRansel", a novel method designed to defend
against poisoning and inference attacks, thereby reducing model degradation and
inference accuracy by 4-8%, compared to standard differential privacy
mechanisms. This pseudo-centralised setup with a Quantum LSTM model, enhances
fraud detection accuracy and reinforces the security and confidentiality of
sensitive financial data.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an information bottleneck asset pricing model to filter noise and focus on critical data for financial asset pricing using DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of overfitting in financial data analysis by DNNs due to noise and redundant information, and improve asset pricing accuracy.

Method: The proposed model uses mutual information constraints to compress low signal-to-noise ratio data, reducing input-output mutual information while retaining key information for nonlinear asset pricing.

Result: The model effectively filters out noise in financial data while capturing intricate nonlinear relationships for asset pricing.

Conclusion: The information bottleneck approach enhances deep networks' ability to price financial assets by mitigating overfitting and improving focus on relevant data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention in financial
asset pricing, due to their strong capacity for modeling complex nonlinear
relationships within financial data. However, sophisticated models are prone to
over-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior
performance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset
pricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate
redundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing.
Our model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear
mapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information
between the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the
mutual information between the compressed representation and the output
prediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is
essentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of
financial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By
leveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only
harnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the
intricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise
information is filtered out during the information compression process.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new aerodynamic shape optimization method using adjoint gradients and a diffusion model to improve efficiency and performance without ad hoc tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerodynamic optimization methods often rely on ad hoc parameter tuning and lack robustness across different optimizers and initializations.

Method: The framework integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs and applies adjoint gradients combined with shape derivatives via automatic differentiation.

Result: Testing on transonic airfoil design cases demonstrated improved aerodynamic performance, robustness, and reduced dependency on optimizer-specific parameters.

Conclusion: AI-based diffusion models can effectively integrate with adjoint methods to enable precise, efficient, and robust aerodynamic optimizations, providing a pathway for high-fidelity design advancements.

Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that
integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth
manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an
equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is
the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and
lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first
computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design
parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through
the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our
framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing
adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on
extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and
general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter
tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and
optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to
conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors
integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity
aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of LLMs in assisting Information Visualization by generating visualizations and analyzing them via simple interactions.

Method: The study examines LLM-generated code for visualizations (e.g., bar and pie charts) and evaluates their ability to answer related questions.

Result: LLMs perform well in generating simple visualizations and answering basic questions, but struggle with complex visualizations like violin plots and more nuanced analytical tasks.

Conclusion: The paper highlights areas where LLMs are effective in visualization tasks and their limitations, offering insights for improving LLMs and visualization tools.

Abstract: Information Visualization has been utilized to gain insights from complex
data. In recent times, Large Language models (LLMs) have performed very well in
many tasks. In this paper, we showcase the capabilities of different popular
LLMs to generate code for visualization based on simple prompts. We also
analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some simpler
visualizations such as bar and pie charts. Moreover, they could answer simple
questions about visualizations. However, LLMs also have several limitations.
For example, some of them had difficulty generating complex visualizations,
such as violin plot. LLMs also made errors in answering some questions about
visualizations, for example, identifying relationships between close boundaries
and determining lengths of shapes. We believe that our insights can be used to
improve both LLMs and Information Visualization systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes "Cognitive Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new research domain to examine AI's influence on shaping human cognition, public reasoning, and epistemology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human-AI interaction research fails to account for AI systems' fundamental reshaping of human cognition, which occurs pre-consciously and has far-reaching implications for distributed cognition.

Method: The authors introduce CIS as a conceptual framework and employ narrative scenarios and "infrastructure breakdown methodologies" to reveal cognitive dependencies induced by AI systems.

Result: CIS identifies AI systems as semantic infrastructures that redefine relevance judgment and epistemic agency while influencing cognition across individual, collective, and societal scales.

Conclusion: The framework highlights gaps in existing disciplines, showing CIS's potential to incorporate cognitive, sociological, and computational methods for studying AI's invisible and adaptive impact on human cognition.

Abstract: Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems
fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot
for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces "Cognitive
Infrastructure Studies" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to
reconceptualize AI as "cognitive infrastructures": foundational, often
invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital
societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through
anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their
influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate "relevance judgment,"
shifting the "locus of epistemic agency" to non-human systems. Through
narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective
(democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how
cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social
epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed
cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring
unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also
addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks
population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot
access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss
cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides
methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence:
"infrastructure breakdown methodologies", experimental approaches that reveal
cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces a robot system using Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) that learns from dialogues with non-experts, improving adaptability and avoiding repeated mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots often encounter unknown scenarios post-deployment, requiring enhanced adaptability and learning capabilities to perform optimally.

Method: The proposed system uses MLLM-powered interactive learning, employing natural dialogues, a chain of question mechanism for intent clarification, and dual-modality retrieval modules for error prevention.

Result: Experiments show both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the proposed system's learning and adaptability.

Conclusion: Integrating interactive learning into MLLM-based systems enhances robots' adaptability and performance in diverse environments.

Abstract: It is crucial that robots' performance can be improved after deployment, as
they are inherently likely to encounter novel scenarios never seen before. This
paper presents an innovative solution: an interactive learning-based robot
system powered by a Multi-modal Large Language Model(MLLM). A key feature of
our system is its ability to learn from natural dialogues with non-expert
users. We also propose chain of question to clarify the exact intent of the
question before providing an answer and dual-modality retrieval modules to
leverage these interaction events to avoid repeating same mistakes, ensuring a
seamless user experience before model updates, which is in contrast to current
mainstream MLLM-based robotic systems. Our system marks a novel approach in
robotics by integrating interactive learning, paving the way for superior
adaptability and performance in diverse environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and improvement of our method through experiments, both
quantitively and qualitatively.

*Luyu Chen,Quanyu Dai,Zeyu Zhang,Xueyang Feng,Mingyu Zhang,Pengcheng Tang,Xu Chen,Yue Zhu,Zhenhua Dong*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces RecUserSim, a user simulator for conversational recommender systems leveraging LLMs to provide realistic, diverse simulations and explicit ratings to address prior evaluation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating conversational recommender systems is difficult due to the lack of realistic, diverse user simulators, and current LLM-based simulators struggle to replicate individual user behavior and provide quantitative evaluations.

Method: The proposed RecUserSim consists of key modules: a profile module to create diverse personas, a memory module for interaction tracking and preference discovery, a core action module for decision-making inspired by Bounded Rationality, and a refinement module for controlled and fine-tuned responses.

Result: Experiments show RecUserSim generates diverse, high-quality interactions and provides consistent and effective evaluations across different base LLMs.

Conclusion: RecUserSim addresses gaps in CRS evaluation with its realistic simulations and effective ratings mechanism, proving to be a powerful tool for studying and refining conversational recommender systems.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enhance user experience through
multi-turn interactions, yet evaluating CRS remains challenging. User
simulators can provide comprehensive evaluations through interactions with CRS,
but building realistic and diverse simulators is difficult. While recent work
leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate user interactions, they
still fall short in emulating individual real users across diverse scenarios
and lack explicit rating mechanisms for quantitative evaluation. To address
these gaps, we propose RecUserSim, an LLM agent-based user simulator with
enhanced simulation realism and diversity while providing explicit scores.
RecUserSim features several key modules: a profile module for defining
realistic and diverse user personas, a memory module for tracking interaction
history and discovering unknown preferences, and a core action module inspired
by Bounded Rationality theory that enables nuanced decision-making while
generating more fine-grained actions and personalized responses. To further
enhance output control, a refinement module is designed to fine-tune final
responses. Experiments demonstrate that RecUserSim generates diverse,
controllable outputs and produces realistic, high-quality dialogues, even with
smaller base LLMs. The ratings generated by RecUserSim show high consistency
across different base LLMs, highlighting its effectiveness for CRS evaluation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explored how AI code assistants affected novice programmers in a two-part exam, showing they increased confidence but led to challenges in transferring unaided skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the impact of AI code assistants on novice programmers' learning experiences and performance during a programming exam.

Method: Students completed a two-part exam: first with AI assistance, then extending their solutions without it. Both quantitative and qualitative responses were collected to gauge perceptions and challenges.

Result: Students found AI helpful for understanding code and building confidence but faced difficulties on unaided tasks, pointing to reliance and conceptual gaps.

Conclusion: Pedagogical strategies should integrate AI while ensuring foundational programming skills are reinforced to address reliance and gaps in understanding.

Abstract: This exploratory study examines how AI code assistants shape novice
programmers' experiences during a two-part exam in an introductory programming
course. In the first part, students completed a programming task with access to
AI support; in the second, they extended their solutions without AI. We
collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to evaluate
their perceptions and challenges. Findings suggest that AI tools were perceived
as helpful for understanding code and increasing confidence, particularly
during initial development. However, students reported difficulties
transferring knowledge to unaided tasks, revealing possible overreliance and
gaps in conceptual understanding. These insights highlight the need for
pedagogical strategies that integrate AI meaningfully while reinforcing
foundational programming skills.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study tested an autonomous large language model-based AI system (Doctronic) in urgent care and found it performed comparably to human clinicians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the global shortage of healthcare practitioners and high administrative burdens, leveraging AI to potentially alleviate these challenges.

Method: A retrospective analysis compared the autonomous AI system Doctronic and human clinicians in 500 telehealth urgent care cases, evaluating diagnostic concordance, treatment plan consistency, and safety metrics.

Result: The AI system matched clinician diagnoses in 81% of cases and treatment plans in 99.2%. Expert review found AI outperformed humans in 36.1% of discordant cases and human performance surpassed AI in 9.3%.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that multi-agent AI systems can provide clinical care comparable to human clinicians and may mitigate healthcare workforce shortages.

Abstract: Background: Globally we face a projected shortage of 11 million healthcare
practitioners by 2030, and administrative burden consumes 50% of clinical time.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help alleviate these
problems. However, no end-to-end autonomous large language model (LLM)-based AI
system has been rigorously evaluated in real-world clinical practice. In this
study, we evaluated whether a multi-agent LLM-based AI framework can function
autonomously as an AI doctor in a virtual urgent care setting. Methods: We
retrospectively compared the performance of the multi-agent AI system Doctronic
and board-certified clinicians across 500 consecutive urgent-care telehealth
encounters. The primary end points: diagnostic concordance, treatment plan
consistency, and safety metrics, were assessed by blinded LLM-based
adjudication and expert human review. Results: The top diagnosis of Doctronic
and clinician matched in 81% of cases, and the treatment plan aligned in 99.2%
of cases. No clinical hallucinations occurred (e.g., diagnosis or treatment not
supported by clinical findings). In an expert review of discordant cases, AI
performance was superior in 36.1%, and human performance was superior in 9.3%;
the diagnoses were equivalent in the remaining cases. Conclusions: In this
first large-scale validation of an autonomous AI doctor, we demonstrated strong
diagnostic and treatment plan concordance with human clinicians, with AI
performance matching and in some cases exceeding that of practicing clinicians.
These findings indicate that multi-agent AI systems achieve comparable clinical
decision-making to human providers and offer a potential solution to healthcare
workforce shortages.

*Andrew Blair,Peggy Gregory,Mary Ellen Foster*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores the integration of a social robot in a church setting, revealing mixed responses and emphasizing the need to consider both social and financial aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how robots can serve in organizations where social benefits take precedence over profit, using a church as the focal context.

Method: Conducted stakeholder interviews (n=15) and applied reflexive thematic analysis to assess perspectives on introducing a social robot.

Result: Participants had mixed views, citing concerns about empathetic responsibility and unintended consequences, but identified benefits in task alleviation and information provision.

Conclusion: Introducing robots into value-driven organizations like churches requires careful consideration of social, intangible, and financial impacts to determine appropriate roles for robots.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have allowed robots to assist in the service
sector, and consequently accelerate job and sector transformation. Less
attention has been paid to the use of robots in real-world organisations where
social benefits, as opposed to profits, are the primary motivator. To explore
these opportunities, we have partnered with a working church and visitor
attraction. We conducted interviews with 15 participants from a range of
stakeholder groups within the church to understand worker perspectives of
introducing a social robot to the church and analysed the results using
reflexive thematic analysis. Findings indicate mixed responses to the use of a
robot, with participants highlighting the empathetic responsibility the church
has towards people and the potential for unintended consequences. However,
information provision and alleviation of menial or mundane tasks were
identified as potential use cases. This highlights the need to consider not
only the financial aspects of robot introduction, but also how social and
intangible values shape what roles a robot should take on within an
organisation.

### [354] [SketchMind: A Multi-Agent Cognitive Framework for Assessing Student-Drawn Scientific Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22904)
*Ehsan Latif,Zirak Khan,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces SketchMind, a multi-agent AI framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches. It demonstrates improved performance and feedback quality over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models face challenges in assessing free-form, visually diverse scientific sketches effectively, lacking interpretability and adaptability to cognitive levels.

Method: SketchMind employs a modular framework with agents for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, feedback generation, and iterative sketch improvement, leveraging multi-agent orchestration.

Result: SketchMind achieves 77.1% accuracy, outperforming baseline methods by ~21.4%. Feedback and co-created sketches scored 4.1/5 from human evaluators, compared to 2.3/5 for baseline models.

Conclusion: SketchMind shows promise in enhancing assessment accuracy and providing meaningful feedback for conceptual growth in AI-driven education, with plans to release resources for further exploration.

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students'
conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such
free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing
solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task
or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical
alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these
limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent
framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches.
SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch
perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch
modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate
SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six
science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that
require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline
GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG
integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We
also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind
performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch
prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items.
Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by
\textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5,
significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o).
Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth
through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be
released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

*Ismail Hossain,Mridul Banik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid framework integrating EEG-based BCIs and transformer-based LLMs to assist users with severe speech or motor impairments in real-time language rehabilitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional AAC systems and language-learning platforms lack adaptability to real-time cognitive and linguistic needs, especially for individuals with neurological conditions.

Method: The proposed system combines EEG signals to capture neural intent and LLMs to generate contextually tailored language content, offering modules for navigation, dynamic personalization, and real-time task difficulty adjustment.

Result: The system integrates mental command navigation, adaptive vocabulary/personalization, and effort-based task adjustment to improve language rehabilitation.

Conclusion: This hybrid framework addresses gaps in real-time adaptability of AAC systems, leveraging EEG-BCIs and LLMs for personalized and efficient language rehabilitation.

Abstract: Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and
language-learning platforms often fail to adapt in real time to the user's
cognitive and linguistic needs, especially in neurological conditions such as
post-stroke aphasia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in
noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)--based brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) and transformer--based large language models (LLMs) offer complementary
strengths: BCIs capture users' neural intent with low fatigue, while LLMs
generate contextually tailored language content. We propose and evaluate a
novel hybrid framework that leverages real-time EEG signals to drive an
LLM-powered language rehabilitation assistant. This system aims to: (1) enable
users with severe speech or motor impairments to navigate language-learning
modules via mental commands; (2) dynamically personalize vocabulary,
sentence-construction exercises, and corrective feedback; and (3) monitor
neural markers of cognitive effort to adjust task difficulty on the fly.

*Julian Acosta,Scott Adams,Julius Kernbach,Romain Hardy,Sung Eun Kim,Luyang Luo,Xiaoman Zhang,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a voice-driven AI system to guide non-medical users through stroke evaluations and record video documentation. It improved stroke detection accuracy markedly, but still required expert oversight due to AI errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency stroke recognition by first responders is highly inconsistent and inaccurate, leading to severe delays in treatment.

Method: Three non-medical users utilized a voice-driven AI to assess simulated stroke patients, while metrics like diagnostic accuracy, completion times, and user confidence were measured.

Result: The system identified 84% of stroke signs, detected 75% of likely LVOs, and achieved 86% stroke diagnosis accuracy, with high user confidence and ease of use ratings.

Conclusion: While promising, this AI system's limitations like incorrect scoring require human oversight; future AI advancements could lead to accurate, independent assessments and transform emergency medical care.

Abstract: We developed a voice-driven artificial intelligence (AI) system that guides
anyone - from paramedics to family members - through expert-level stroke
evaluations using natural conversation, while also enabling smartphone video
capture of key examination components for documentation and potential expert
review. This addresses a critical gap in emergency care: current stroke
recognition by first responders is inconsistent and often inaccurate, with
sensitivity for stroke detection as low as 58%, causing life-threatening delays
in treatment. Three non-medical volunteers used our AI system to assess ten
simulated stroke patients, including cases with likely large vessel occlusion
(LVO) strokes and stroke-like conditions, while we measured diagnostic
accuracy, completion times, user confidence, and expert physician review of the
AI-generated reports. The AI system correctly identified 84% of individual
stroke signs and detected 75% of likely LVOs, completing evaluations in just
over 6 minutes. Users reported high confidence (median 4.5/5) and ease of use
(mean 4.67/5). The system successfully identified 86% of actual strokes but
also incorrectly flagged 2 of 3 non-stroke cases as strokes. When an expert
physician reviewed the AI reports with videos, they identified the correct
diagnosis in 100% of cases, but felt confident enough to make preliminary
treatment decisions in only 40% of cases due to observed AI errors including
incorrect scoring and false information. While the current system's limitations
necessitate human oversight, ongoing rapid advancements in speech-to-speech AI
models suggest that future versions are poised to enable highly accurate
assessments. Achieving human-level voice interaction could transform emergency
medical care, putting expert-informed assessment capabilities in everyone's
hands.

### [357] [Automated Label Placement on Maps via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22952)
*Harry Shomer,Jiejun Xu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAPLE, a new framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automated label placement (ALP) in maps, overcoming traditional limitations by combining retrieval-augmented generation and structured prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual label placement on maps is challenging and difficult to scale, as existing automated methods fail to adapt to context, integrate cartographic standards, or follow instructions effectively.

Method: The methodology formulates ALP as a data editing problem, using MAPLE—a newly curated dataset. It involves retrieval-augmented generation to include label guidelines in prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs for generating label coordinates.

Result: The evaluation of four open-source LLMs on the MAPLE dataset showed that LLMs—guided by retrieval-augmented prompts—can produce label placements aligned with expert standards, demonstrating generalization across different landmark types.

Conclusion: This study offers a scalable AI-assisted framework for map finishing and highlights the potential of foundation models for adapting to structured data editing tasks, such as label placement.

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of
spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite
its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale,
as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions,
adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we
introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates
the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)
for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate
MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world
maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from
open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each
landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them
into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label
coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall
performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This
includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific
retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated
outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a
scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential
of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study introduces Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based system to personalize and scale accessibility assessments for built environments based on user preferences and mobility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accessibility assessments of built environments are challenging for people with disabilities as manual methods are cumbersome and machine learning approaches lack personalization. The paper seeks to address these gaps.

Method: They developed Accessibility Scout utilizing LLMs to analyze photos of built environments. It incorporates collaborative Human-AI interactions to generate personalized assessments tailored to user needs.

Result: Accessibility Scout demonstrated effectiveness in technical evaluations and user studies, outperforming traditional accessibility standards and adapting its capability based on user preferences.

Conclusion: Accessibility Scout marks progress towards scalable, personalized accessibility assessments, and offers future potential in improving accessibility evaluation systems for people with disabilities.

Abstract: Assessing the accessibility of unfamiliar built environments is critical for
people with disabilities. However, manual assessments, performed by users or
their personal health professionals, are laborious and unscalable, while
automatic machine learning methods often neglect an individual user's unique
needs. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable novel approaches
to this problem, balancing personalization with scalability to enable more
adaptive and context-aware assessments of accessibility. We present
Accessibility Scout, an LLM-based accessibility scanning system that identifies
accessibility concerns from photos of built environments. With use,
Accessibility Scout becomes an increasingly capable "accessibility scout",
tailoring accessibility scans to an individual's mobility level, preferences,
and specific environmental interests through collaborative Human-AI
assessments. We present findings from three studies: a formative study with six
participants to inform the design of Accessibility Scout, a technical
evaluation of 500 images of built environments, and a user study with 10
participants of varying mobility. Results from our technical evaluation and
user study show that Accessibility Scout can generate personalized
accessibility scans that extend beyond traditional ADA considerations. Finally,
we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our work and future steps
for building more scalable and personalized accessibility assessments of the
physical world.

TL;DR: The authors introduce DUET, an LLM-based tool for improving feedback on UML and ER diagrams in educational settings. Evaluations highlighted both its potential and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teaching UML and ER diagrams is challenging due to the abstract thinking and syntax/semantics mastery required, compounded by the lack of scalable, personalized feedback in traditional methods.

Method: DUET, an LLM-based tool, converts UML and ER diagrams into textual representations to compare reference and student submissions, providing structured, reflective feedback. A multi-stage pipeline facilitates this comparison.

Result: The tool was evaluated through semi-structured interviews with six participants, who highlighted strengths (e.g., scalability, learning support) and limitations (e.g., reliability, potential misuse).

Conclusion: DUET demonstrates promise for integrating LLMs into computer science education, offering a basis for further classroom adoption and empirical studies.

Abstract: UML and ER diagrams are foundational in computer science education but come
with challenges for learners due to the need for abstract thinking, contextual
understanding, and mastery of both syntax and semantics. These complexities are
difficult to address through traditional teaching methods, which often struggle
to provide scalable, personalized feedback, especially in large classes. We
introduce DUET (Diagrammatic UML & ER Tutor), a prototype of an LLM-based tool,
which converts a reference diagram and a student-submitted diagram into a
textual representation and provides structured feedback based on the
differences. It uses a multi-stage LLM pipeline to compare diagrams and
generate reflective feedback. Furthermore, the tool enables analytical insights
for educators, aiming to foster self-directed learning and inform instructional
strategies. We evaluated DUET through semi-structured interviews with six
participants, including two educators and four teaching assistants. They
identified strengths such as accessibility, scalability, and learning support
alongside limitations, including reliability and potential misuse. Participants
also suggested potential improvements, such as bulk upload functionality and
interactive clarification features. DUET presents a promising direction for
integrating LLMs into modeling education and offers a foundation for future
classroom integration and empirical evaluation.

*Dominique Geissler,Claire Robertson,Stefan Feuerriegel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper studies five different interventions to improve digital literacy for detecting deepfakes, finding they boost discernment and retain trust in real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over the impact of deepfakes on trust, institutions, and elections drive the need for scalable solutions to improve digital literacy.

Method: The study tested five interventions, including textual guidance, visual demonstrations, gamified exercises, implicit learning, and explanations of AI-generated deepfakes, with 1,200 US participants.

Result: Interventions improved deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points and upheld trust in real images across diverse populations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates scalable, effective methods to enhance people's ability to detect deepfakes, addressing a pressing digital literacy issue.

Abstract: Deepfakes, i.e., images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), can erode
trust in institutions and compromise election outcomes, as people often
struggle to discern real images from deepfakes. Improving digital literacy can
help address these challenges, yet scalable and effective approaches remain
largely unexplored. Here, we compare the efficacy of five digital literacy
interventions to boost people's ability to discern deepfakes: (1) textual
guidance on common indicators of deepfakes; (2) visual demonstrations of these
indicators; (3) a gamified exercise for identifying deepfakes; (4) implicit
learning through repeated exposure and feedback; and (5) explanations of how
deepfakes are generated with the help of AI. We conducted an experiment with
N=1,200 participants from the United States to test the immediate and long-term
effectiveness of our interventions. Our results show that our interventions can
boost deepfake discernment by up to 13 percentage points while maintaining
trust in real images. Altogether, our approach is scalable, suitable for
diverse populations, and highly effective for boosting deepfake detection while
maintaining trust in truthful information.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a platform for cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) using V2X communication, validated through simulations and practical tests with autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in literature where CACC systems were primarily simulated and rarely demonstrated in physical vehicle systems.

Method: Develop a tangible experimental platform that integrates CACC systems, perform detailed tests using autonomous vehicle platforms, and analyze their behavior in homogeneous platoons.

Result: Simulations and field tests confirm the performance and benefits of the proposed CACC system for vehicle platooning scenarios.

Conclusion: The work underscores the practical viability of CACC systems, advancing real-world applications for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a tangible platform for demonstrating
the practical implementation of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC)
systems, an enhancement to the standard adaptive cruise control (ACC) concept
by means of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. It involves a detailed
examination of existing longitudinal controllers and their performance in
homogeneous vehicle platoons. Moreover, extensive tests are conducted using
multiple autonomous experimental vehicle platform topologies to verify the
effectiveness of the controller. The outcomes from both simulations and field
tests affirm the substantial benefits of the proposed CACC platooning approach
in longitudinal vehicle platooning scenarios. This research is crucial due to a
notable gap in the existing literature; while numerous studies focus on
simulated vehicle platooning systems, there is lack of research demonstrating
these controllers on physical vehicle systems or robot platforms. This paper
seeks to fill this gap by providing a practical demonstration of CACC systems
in action, showcasing their potential for real-world application in intelligent
transportation systems.

### [362] [On the Complexity of Finding Stationary Points in Nonconvex Simple Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23155)
*Jincheng Cao,Ruichen Jiang,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani,Aryan Mokhtari*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses solving simple bilevel optimization problems with nonconvex objectives using first-order algorithms, achieving joint stationarity with polynomial complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of bilevel optimization where guaranteeing global optimality is intractable without additional structural assumptions like convexity.

Method: They develop a variant of the Dynamic Barrier Gradient Descent (DBGD) framework to find stationary points in bilevel optimization with complexity scaling based on accuracies.

Result: The method achieves joint stationarity with complexity bounds of $\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}},\epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, providing polynomial-time guarantees.

Conclusion: This study provides the first discrete-time algorithm with provable polynomial complexity for joint stationarity in general nonconvex bilevel optimization problems, offering a significant advancement in solving these types of optimization challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of solving a simple bilevel optimization
problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized over the solution set of
the lower-level problem. We focus on the general setting in which both the
upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to
the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level
objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL)
condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we
introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim
to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in
polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the
upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing
a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that
a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent
(DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel
problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\epsilon_f,
\epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ denote the
target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives,
respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}},
\epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, where $p \geq 0$ is an arbitrary
constant balancing the terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
complexity result for a discrete-time algorithm that guarantees joint
stationarity for both levels in general nonconvex simple bilevel problems.
