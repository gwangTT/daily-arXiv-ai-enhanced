### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel neuro-symbolic reasoning system based on Graph Signal Processing (GSP), using spectral methods across the reasoning pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency in neuro-symbolic reasoning via spectral graph techniques.

Method: The approach encodes symbolic entities and relationships as graph signals, processes them via learnable spectral filters, and maps to symbolic predicates for inference using GSP.

Result: Experiments on reasoning datasets show enhancements in logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency compared to existing models.

Conclusion: GSP provides a solid and efficient mathematical foundation for developing robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computational framework where descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interactions, drawing from Buddhist epistemology to model purposeful behavior via goal-equivalent experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models of purposeful behavior often assume separate components for state representation and reward functions, but there has not been a computational framework that explains how these aspects could co-emerge from an agent's goal and interaction with its environment.

Method: The paper proposes a framework based on the concept of 'telic states,' which are defined as goal-equivalent experience distributions. These telic states emerge from statistical divergences between behaviors and goal-oriented experience features, inspired by insights from Buddhist epistemology.

Result: The framework presents a novel explanation for the co-emergence of descriptive and prescriptive world model aspects, supported by existing empirical and theoretical evidence. It offers a minimalistic yet effective way to understand goal-directed learning.

Conclusion: This approach not only challenges traditional computational accounts but also unifies behavioral, phenomenological, and neural aspects of purposeful behavior, potentially advancing our understanding of intelligence across various domains.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang WÃ¶rndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC is a framework involving multiple agents designed to address popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address popularity bias in tourism recommendation systems and promote lesser-visited, sustainable destinations.

Method: Collab-REC employs three LLM-based agents focusing on personalization, popularity, and sustainability. A non-LLM moderator refines and negotiates the agents' suggestions.

Result: Experiments on European city queries showed increased diversity and relevance, promoting underrepresented destinations.

Conclusion: This multi-agent approach demonstrates the potential of fostering collaboration among agents to tackle over-tourism and improve recommendation systems.

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance crowd simulation, enabling agents to engage in dialogue and demonstrate complex social and environmental behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current crowd simulations lack the ability to incorporate complex social and environmental interactions influenced by dialogue and personalities, which are critical for realistic human-like crowd behavior.

Method: The method incorporates two main components: a dialogue system and language-driven navigation, where agent-centric LLMs generate dialogues based on personalities, roles, and relationships, influencing movement and steering decisions.

Result: Validated in complex scenarios, the method demonstrates natural grouping and ungrouping of agents and acts as an information-passing mechanism, enhancing the realism of crowd simulations with emergent group behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves the realism of simulated crowds by integrating dialogue-driven social interactions and navigation, enabling agents to display human-like behaviors based on perception and communication.

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [5] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper finds that longer reasoning times in Large Language Models worsen confidence calibration, but search-augmented generation vastly improves it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve confidence calibration in Large Language Models, especially when used as question-answering tools.

Method: Developed an extended version of the ClimateX dataset, assessed how reasoning budgets and search-augmented tools affect calibration accuracy.

Result: Found that reasoning-heavy approaches lead to systematic overconfidence, while search-augmented models achieve high calibration accuracy (89.3%).

Conclusion: Access to relevant information via search capabilities plays a more critical role in calibration than reasoning budgets or depth.

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

### [6] [Demonstrating Onboard Inference for Earth Science Applications with Spectral Analysis Algorithms and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15053)
*Itai Zilberstein,Alberto Candela,Steve Chien,David Rijlaarsdam,Tom Hendrix,Leonie Buckley,Aubrey Dunne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the onboard data analysis capabilities of CogniSAT-6/HAMMER (CS-6), a satellite equipped with hyperspectral instruments and neural network acceleration hardware, using deep learning and spectral analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to empower new Earth science measurements and responses by performing advanced data analysis and inference directly onboard satellites.

Method: The approach involves integrating neural network acceleration hardware and hyperspectral analysis tools onboard the CS-6 satellite, employing deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

Result: The onboard data analysis capabilities of CS-6 are demonstrated for multiple Earth science applications.

Conclusion: Conducting data analysis onboard satellites like CS-6 advances Earth science research and enables more responsive and innovative measurements.

Abstract: In partnership with Ubotica Technologies, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is
demonstrating state-of-the-art data analysis onboard CogniSAT-6/HAMMER (CS-6).
CS-6 is a satellite with a visible and near infrared range hyperspectral
instrument and neural network acceleration hardware. Performing data analysis
at the edge (e.g. onboard) can enable new Earth science measurements and
responses. We will demonstrate data analysis and inference onboard CS-6 for
numerous applications using deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

### [7] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA introduces a scalable, efficient approach to enhance safety in fine-tuned language models by pruning unsafe updates, maintaining task performance, and reducing inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods like LoRA enable powerful adaptations but may compromise safety alignment, especially in planning tasks. Existing solutions requiring both base and instruction-tuned checkpoints are impractical due to limited availability.

Method: The authors propose MAS-SVD to analyze LoRA's weight updates and design SSI, a metric to detect and prune layers with unsafe updates post-hoc. This approach is lightweight, data-free, and model-independent.

Result: S3LoRA improves safety metrics across various tasks, maintains or enhances performance metrics, and reduces inference costs, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: S3LoRA proves to be a practical, scalable tool for deploying LLMs in constrained and critical environments, ensuring safety without compromising efficiency.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

### [8] [Argumentation for Explainable Workforce Optimisation (with Appendix)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15118)
*Jennifer Leigh,Dimitrios Letsios,Alessandro Mella,Lucio Machetti,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study addresses workforce management by using abstract argumentation, enabling dynamic adaptation to changes and providing explanations for stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce management optimization is complex, especially with real-time changes requiring stakeholder explanations.

Method: They incorporated abstract argumentation into workforce management and validated it via a user study.

Result: The tool and model offered better problem-solving efficiency and accuracy compared to manual methods.

Conclusion: Abstract argumentation enhances adaptability and provides effective explanations, improving performance in workforce management tasks.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

### [9] [Open-Universe Assistance Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119)
*Rachel Ma,Jingyi Qu,Andreea Bobu,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework and method for Embodied AI agents to act on diverse and evolving human goals using natural language during interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents often face challenges in reasoning about non-predefined human goals and preferences in an unbounded and dynamic environment.

Method: The authors propose GOOD, an online and data-efficient approach utilizing an LLM to extract natural language goals during interaction. GOOD simulates diverse user intents to derive probabilistic inference over candidate goals.

Result: GOOD was tested in text-based grocery shopping and household robotics environments, outperforming baselines lacking explicit goal tracking in evaluations by both LLMs and humans.

Conclusion: GOOD facilitates interpretable and accurate extraction of complex human goals in real-time interactions, demonstrating improved performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: aiXiv introduces an innovative open-access platform leveraging human and AI scientists for improving AI-generated research quality through iterative review and revision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of venues accepting AI-generated research and the inefficiencies of traditional peer review systems hinder the dissemination and advancement of scientific research produced by AI.

Method: aiXiv leverages a multi-agent architecture that integrates human and AI scientists, alongside API and MCP interfaces, to allow submission, review, and refinement of research proposals and papers.

Result: Experiments show that aiXiv improves the quality of AI-generated research through its iterative revision and review system.

Conclusion: aiXiv establishes a scalable ecosystem for AI-driven scientific discovery, paving the way for effective dissemination of high-quality research and fostering scientific progress.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 represent significant advancements in GUI agent modeling, providing a robust open-source ecosystem for future development and deployment across diverse platforms.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are
open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

### [12] [PuzzleClone: An SMT-Powered Framework for Synthesizing Verifiable Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15180)
*Kai Xiong,Yanwei Huang,Rongjunchen Zhang,Kun Chen,Haipang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone introduces a framework for generating verified mathematical and logic datasets using SMT, which significantly improves reasoning in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs by addressing issues in existing datasets, such as reliability, diversity, and scalability.

Method: The paper synthesizes data using SMT and innovations like encoding puzzles, systematic variable/constraint randomization, and validating data through reproduction mechanisms.

Result: PuzzleClone benchmark contains over 83K diverse puzzles. Post-training on these datasets leads to substantial performance improvements across logic and math benchmarks, including up to 12.5% improvement on specific tests.

Conclusion: PuzzleClone enhances LLM capabilities in reasoning and logic, indicating the effectiveness of systematic and verified data synthesis for training plausibly scalable AI.

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

*Wenjie Lin,Jin Wei-Kocsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat utilizes a domain-specific framework to address hyperhidrosis care with enhanced diagnosis and empathetic support, using synthetic data generation, model fine-tuning, and expert validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of research in using large language models for rare medical conditions like hyperhidrosis, characterized by excessive sweating and affecting psychosocial well-being.

Method: The authors propose a three-stage pipeline involving data augmentation with synthetic cases, fine-tuning using an open-source model, and expert validation to iteratively improve trustworthiness and efficacy.

Result: LLM4Sweat outperforms existing approaches, offering trustworthy, empathetic, and specialized support for hyperhidrosis and providing a pathway for addressing other rare medical conditions.

Conclusion: The paper introduces LLM4Sweat as the first open-source LLM framework specifically designed for hyperhidrosis, showcasing its potential to generalize to similar rare diseases and overcome data scarcity challenges.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

Motivation: Address the lack of open-source datasets and tools for surgical wound diagnosis, overcoming issues like data privacy and annotation cost while improving patient care.

Method: Develop SurgWound dataset with 697 annotated images. Create a benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis. Propose a three-stage WoundQwen framework using multiple MLLMs for prediction, diagnosis, and report generation.

Result: SurgWound dataset features diverse wound types with eight attributes. The three-stage WoundQwen framework demonstrates improved diagnosis, infection risk assessment, and intervention guidance.

Conclusion: The framework can enhance surgical wound screening, offering personalized, timely wound care through open-source data and advanced models, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

### [15] [R-ConstraintBench: Evaluating LLMs on NP-Complete Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15204)
*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to solve Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), revealing performance degradation when constraints increase in complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding the reliability of LLMs when dealing with highly constrained scheduling problems critical for planning in sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and IT.

Method: The authors introduce R-ConstraintBench, a benchmarking framework that incrementally increases constraintsâsuch as precedence, downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive constraintsâin scheduling scenarios, using synthetic and domain-specific datasets.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows strong model performance on simple precedence constraints, but a significant drop when additional complex constraints are introduced. Moreover, models struggle to generalize from synthetic benchmarks to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Constraint interaction, not graph depth, is the major performance bottleneck for LLMs, limiting their generalization and reliability in high-constraint scheduling tasks.

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel system for converting hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams using Vision-Language and Large Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle to handle spatial precision and compositional requirements for flowcharts, creating the need for a specialized solution.

Method: "See it. Say it. Sorted." utilizes Vision-Language Models as critics and Large Language Models for generating and selecting editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) outputs in an iterative loop.

Result: The proposed system reconstructed sketches more accurately than advanced image-generation models, like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, and produced outputs compatible with tools like PowerPoint.

Conclusion: This training-free approach reliably generates editable diagrams that preserve layout, connectivity, and global constraints, with extensibility and open-source availability.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

TL;DR: The paper introduces advanced optimization algorithms to address urban land-use allocation challenges, striking a balance between compatibility and economic goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban land-use allocation is key to sustainable development but remains a complex issue due to conflicting objectives like compatibility and economics.

Method: The study develops optimization algorithms, such as CR+DES and MSBX+MO, combining differential evolution and genetic models, complemented by statistical and constraint relaxation techniques.

Result: Algorithms yield significant performance improvements (e.g., 3.16% in compatibility and 3.3% in price optimization) over existing approaches in a case study involving 1,290 plots.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide robust tools for urban planners to address multi-objective land-use allocation challenges effectively, aiding policy-making in urbanizing areas.

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Multiple Memory System (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology to improve long-term memory storage and recall in large language model agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively handling and utilizing the vast historical data generated during agent interactions remains challenging due to the poor quality of memory content in current methods.

Method: The paper proposes the MMS, a system that organizes short-term memory into long-term memory fragments. It creates retrieval and contextual memory units that correspond one-to-one, enhancing response quality and knowledge utilization through relevant recall during interactions.

Result: Experiments on the LoCoMo dataset demonstrated that MMS outperforms existing methods like MemoryBank and A-MEM. Ablation studies and robustness analyses further validated its design and practical feasibility.

Conclusion: The proposed MMS enhances memory quality and recall efficiency, significantly improving response quality in agents powered by large language models, with demonstrable practical value.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

### [19] [Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory for LLM Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15305)
*Wei Yang,Jinwei Xiao,Hongming Zhang,Qingyang Zhang,Yanna Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (CFG Memory), a framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with coarse-to-fine memory mechanisms to improve planning adaptability and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based planning agents rely on single-granularity memory, which limits diversity of knowledge and planning flexibility due to the quality constraints of collected experiences.

Method: The proposed CFG Memory includes grounding coarse-grained points during training for guiding experience collection, extracting hybrid-grained tips, and retrieving task-relevant experiences during inference. It uses fine-grained situation analysis for plan correction when anomalies occur.

Result: CFG Memory allows retrieval and use of refined multi-granularity information for better planning and flexible adaptation in diverse environments.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that enhancing memory mechanisms with coarse-to-fine granularity enables LLMs to effectively adapt to complex and anomalous tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

### [20] [Search-Based Credit Assignment for Offline Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15327)
*Xiancheng Gao,Yufeng Shi,Wengang Zhou,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) approach to unify expert demonstrations and human preferences for offline reinforcement learning, tackling challenges in credit assignment and feedback integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of relying on well-defined reward functions in offline reinforcement learning, and to overcome the limitations of using individual human feedback types (expert demonstrations or preferences) alone.

Method: The SPW scheme searches for similar state-action pairs in expert demonstrations for each transition in preference-labeled trajectories. It derives importance weights from similarity scores to guide preference learning and improve credit assignment.

Result: SPW significantly improves the joint learning process by integrating both human feedback forms, outperforming previous methods on robot manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: SPW enhances offline reinforcement learning by leveraging complementary strengths of expert demonstrations and preferences, offering more accurate credit assignment than traditional approaches.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

*Bin Deng,Yizhe Feng,Zeming Liu,Qing Wei,Xiangrong Zhu,Shuai Chen,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a dataset, RETAIL, and a framework, TGMA, to address challenges in automated travel planning, improving performance under real-world conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated travel planning systems fail to address implicit queries, environmental factors, diverse user preferences, and detailed planning requirements.

Method: The paper creates a novel dataset called RETAIL and proposes a topic-guided multi-agent framework (TGMA) for decision-making and comprehensive travel planning.

Result: Experiments show that existing models have a pass rate of only 1.0%, while TGMA achieves a substantially improved pass rate of 2.72%.

Conclusion: TGMA and RETAIL offer significant improvements and pave the way for more effective real-world travel planning solutions.

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

*Jinning Yang,Wen Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes DiagECG, a framework combining ECG signal analysis and large language models for improved clinical diagnostic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing ECG diagnostic tools that struggle with generalization and open-ended reasoning in clinical tasks.

Method: DiagECG uses a lead-independent encoder and quantization module to transform ECG signals into symbolic tokens, integrates these tokens into a large language model, performs autoregressive ECG forecasting for pretraining, and applies instruction tuning for clinical tasks.

Result: DiagECG demonstrates strong performance across multiple tasks, with effective generalization to new, unseen data, as shown through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The integration of symbolic ECG representations with large language models shows significant promise for advancing medical reasoning and clinical diagnostics.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Motivation: To develop methods that optimize planning with minimal disruption to the initial state while balancing action costs.

Method: Various formal planning-based compilations are introduced for joint optimization of action costs and plan disruption.

Conclusion: Plans can be effectively generated that optimize both action costs and initial state modifications in practical scenarios.

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define
various planning-based compilations that aim to jointly optimize both the sum

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called "Think in Blocks" for adaptive reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the problem of computational waste and slower responses caused by excessively long chains-of-thought in LLMs during complex reasoning tasks.

Method: The "Think in Blocks" framework involves predicting a reasoning budget (number of blocks) and partitions the reasoning process accordingly, training through a three-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning, reward-guided optimization, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The method enables dynamic adjustment of reasoning depth based on task complexity, facilitating efficient inference and deployment.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel solution for flexible and adaptive reasoning in LLMs, reducing overthinking and improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

TL;DR: The paper explores how intergroup rivalry and repeated interactions drive cooperation in AI agents by simulating team-based Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments with language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand and improve cooperative behaviors in autonomous AI agents to align better with human values.

Method: Researchers set up virtual tournaments involving language model agents grouped into teams playing a Prisoner's Dilemma game, analyzing the effects of internal dynamics and intergroup competition.

Result: The combination of intergroup rivalry and team dynamics significantly boosts both overall and one-shot cooperation levels in the gameplay.

Conclusion: Intergroup competition can surprisingly enhance cooperation in AI agents, providing useful insights for designing socially aligned multi-agent systems.

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing LLMs' capabilities in 3D reasoning as current methods handle only simple questions with short reasoning chains.

Method: Proposes DeepThink3D with a combinatorial approach to generate more complex questions and fine-tunes LLMs using Direct Preference Optimization to improve 3D tool usage.

Result: DeepThink3D significantly improves tool usage and accuracy of LLMs in complex 3D reasoning tasks on the SQA3D benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances LLM capabilities in solving sophisticated 3D reasoning tasks by optimizing tool integration and reasoning chains.

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using dynamical systems theory to assess the safety and robustness of reinforcement learning policies, introducing methods for both visualization and quantitative evaluation of policy behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of formal verification methods limits the application of reinforcement learning in safety-critical systems, necessitating new approaches to analyze their behavior and ensure safety.

Method: The authors model the RL agent-environment system as a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system, using Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to identify Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS). They introduce metrics like MBR, ASAS, and TASAS to quantitatively evaluate policy robustness.

Result: Experiments across discrete and continuous environments show the framework can assess policy behavior comprehensively, revealing critical flaws that rewards alone cannot uncover.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances interpretability, identifies flaws in RL policies, and offers quantitative measures, advancing towards safer RL applications in critical systems.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents Agentics, a modular framework enabling agent-based systems to perform structured reasoning and improve generalization across complex data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and enhance AI development by focusing on modeling data through logical transductions instead of manually crafting prompts.

Method: Introduce a framework where agents are abstracted to enable logical transductions between data types, leveraging declarative language and LLMs.

Result: Empirical evidence shows effectiveness in multiple-choice QA, text-to-SQL semantic parsing, and prompt optimization tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or scalability improvements.

Conclusion: Agentics facilitates better data modeling and AI workflow efficiency, offering an open-source implementation for practical and research use cases.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

### [31] [Adapting A Vector-Symbolic Memory for Lisp ACT-R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15630)
*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper enhances ACT-Râs Declarative Memory (DM) with Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM), providing scalable vector-based alternatives and improved functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt HDM for use in ACT-R frameworks, allowing scalability, better chunk recall, and integration of previous ACT-R models.

Method: Designed vector-based ACT-R functions, implemented a text processing pipeline for document memory addition, and established mechanisms to retrieve chunks from vector representations.

Result: The adapted HDM maintains its vector-symbolic benefits while allowing compatibility with legacy ACT-R models, requiring minimal changes.

Conclusion: HDM integration into ACT-R shows promise for scalability and improved chunk recall, paving the way for further iterations and model testing with diverse applications.

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

### [32] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to understand individual agent behaviors in a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) system without relying on value feedback, using a metric called Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable deployment of MARL systems, it is essential to discern individual agent contributions to team success, especially in scenarios devoid of value feedback.

Method: The authors propose Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), an information-theoretic method based on Shapley values to quantify an agent's causal effect on their teammates' decision-making policies, by analyzing policy distributions.

Result: The study demonstrates that ICVs effectively reveal the alignment or diversity of agent strategies in MARL environments, identifying behaviors that aid team success and decision-making flexibility.

Conclusion: The method provides new insights into cooperation dynamics, enhances explainability, and helps identify beneficial agent behaviors in MARL systems.

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques EU AI Actâs regulatory gaps regarding AI's data lifecycle and proposes a framework for more comprehensive regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the absence of a regulatory framework that captures the full lifecycle dynamics of data in AI systems, including the associated ethical, economic, and power asymmetries.

Method: This study utilizes a cross-disciplinary framework informed by Simondonian philosophy of technology and technical analysis to model the AI lifecycle and its recursive nature.

Result: The paper identifies regulatory blind spots in understanding AI's self-reinforcing data lifecycle, or 'futurity,' which includes recursive data generation and power asymmetry concentration.

Conclusion: The authors propose regulatory measures such as lifecycle audits, recursion transparency, and the right to contest recursive data reuse to mitigate documented issues and achieve Responsible AI.

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

*Cooper Elsworth,Keguo Huang,David Patterson,Ian Schneider,Robert Sedivy,Savannah Goodman,Ben Townsend,Parthasarathy Ranganathan,Jeff Dean,Amin Vahdat,Ben Gomes,James Manyika*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper measures the environmental impact of AI serving in a large-scale production environment, focusing on energy, carbon emissions, and water usage, using Google's Gemini systems as a case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving, but no prior studies have measured environmental metrics of AI inference workloads in real production environments.

Method: The authors propose a methodology for comprehensive measurement of energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption across the full AI serving stack, and apply it to Google's Gemini AI assistant infrastructure.

Result: The study found that one Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24 Wh of energy, with Google's efforts leading to a significant 44x reduction in carbon footprint and 33x reduction in energy consumption over a year.

Conclusion: Though the environmental impact of AI serving is relatively low compared to other activities, continuous measurement and efficiency improvements are critical for sustainable AI development.

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

*Emma Rath,Stuart Armstrong,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to detect parasocial cues during real-time AI conversations using a language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the negative impact and challenges of parasocial relationships in human-AI interactions.

Method: They repurpose a language model to evaluate conversations, conducting iterative evaluation on synthetic datasets with five-stage testing.

Result: The framework identified all parasocial conversations, avoided false positives, and detected cues typically within the first exchanges.

Conclusion: Evaluation agents show potential in mitigating harmful parasocial relationships in AI interactions, demonstrating feasibility for deployment.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel framework using multi-agent Large Language Models to optimize machine learning configurations through natural language reasoning, enhancing adaptability, interpretability, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Configuration optimization in machine learning remains challenging due to the need for coordinated tuning across multiple dimensions such as model architecture, training strategy, and hyperparameters. Current methods lack adaptability, semantic reasoning, and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose LGT, a framework utilizing multi-agent Large Language Models with specialized agents (Advisor, Evaluator, Optimizer) that collaborate to optimize configurations. They use textual gradients as qualitative feedback to supplement numerical optimization.

Result: LGT demonstrated significant improvements over traditional optimization approaches, achieving better performance and high interpretability in evaluations conducted on six diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Language-Guided Tuning provides a semantic, adaptive, and interpretable framework for configuration optimization, offering notable advancements over existing methods.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scalability and deployability of analog IMC systems are hindered by computational unreliability due to stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the inefficiency of current fault-mitigation algorithms.

Method: The authors introduce a row-column hybrid grouping technique for fault tolerance, coupled with a compiler pipeline reformulating fault-aware weight decomposition as Integer Linear Programming for faster compilation.

Result: Experiments showed up to an 8% improvement in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency improvement compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques enhance fault tolerance and compile efficiency, demonstrating improved performance and energy efficiency in analog IMC systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EDAS, a unified meta-metric for holistic evaluation of Knowledge Graph Completion models across datasets and evaluation criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for Knowledge Graph Completion use disparate metrics and datasets, leading to inconsistencies in model ranking and selection.

Method: The paper proposes EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution), which synthesizes multi-metric and multi-dataset performance into a single normalized score for KGC models.

Result: EDAS provides consistent rankings and integrates performance metrics, as demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets like FB15k-237 and WN18RR.

Conclusion: EDAS emerges as a robust and interpretable framework for evaluating KGC models, offering fair and global assessments across diverse datasets and metrics.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified co-training framework for improving content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating multiple safety behaviors with controllability during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the limitations of existing content safety methods in LLMs, such as multi-stage pipelines and lack of fine-grained post-deployment control.

Method: The proposed co-training framework integrates positive, negative, and rejective safety behaviors into a single training stage (SFT) while using 'magic tokens' for dynamic behavioral switching during inference.

Result: The framework achieves comparable safety alignment performance to prior methods like SFT+DPO. Notably, an 8B model outperforms a much larger 671B model (DeepSeek-R1) in terms of safety performance, while reducing training complexity and deployment costs.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable, efficient, and controllable solution for content safety in LLMs, providing flexibility for diverse deployment scenarios and demonstrating robustness through distinct behavioral modes.

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety

highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide task participants with initial insights and feedback based on automatic evaluations to refine their machine translation system submissions.

Method: Preliminary rankings were generated using automatic evaluation metrics, although they may favor certain system techniques like re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding.

Result: A preliminary automated ranking of MT systems was produced, with the acknowledgment that the results might be biased.

Conclusion: The preliminary ranking is shared as an interim feedback tool for participants, while human evaluations will provide the official and more reliable results later.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [47] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to culturally localize math word problems for low-resource languages, addressing gaps in multilingual datasets caused by English-centric biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the lack of accurate socio-culturally grounded multilingual math datasets, as most existing ones are English-centric or based on translations without native context.

Method: Proposes an LLM-driven framework that constructs math datasets with native names, organizations, and currencies from existing sources.

Result: The framework reveals improved robustness and reduced English-centric bias in multilingual mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Cultural localization enhances the fairness and effectiveness of math word problems in low-resource languages for LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

*Dario Vajda,Domen VreÅ¡,Marko Robnik-Å ikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models were fine-tuned for machine translation by employing Direct Preference Optimization using curated Slovene datasets, resulting in higher translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the effectiveness of a general instruction-tuned large language model for machine translation using relatively small and easily obtainable data resources.

Method: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training was used to fine-tune the GaMS-9B-Instruct model on ranked translation pairs derived from public data. Heuristics and COMET metrics were implemented to evaluate translation quality.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieved significant improvement in translation quality, with COMET score gains of 0.04 and 0.02 over the baseline models. It also reduced language and formatting errors.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning large language models with a strategic use of limited resources, like ranked data from heuristics and metrics, can lead to notable improvements in machine translation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Conversational Explainable AI (ConvXAI) for multilingual and custom input applicability by introducing datasets (MultiCoXQL, Compass) and proposing a new parsing approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ConvXAI systems lack effective support for multilingual capabilities and free-form custom inputs due to limited training data.

Method: The researchers introduced the datasets MultiCoXQL and Compass for multilingual and custom input tasks. They also proposed a new parsing strategy, and evaluated several LLMs and BERT-type models on these datasets.

Result: The MultiCoXQL and Compass datasets enabled assessments of LLMs in multilingual parsing and custom input extraction tasks. Three LLMs and BERT-type models showed varied performance across languages and methodologies.

Conclusion: The study bridges gaps in multilingual and custom input handling in ConvXAI systems by developing new datasets, proposing a parsing approach, and employing diverse evaluations.

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient test-time alignment algorithm, SSS, for large language models (LLMs), reducing inference costs while maintaining alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient test-time alignment methods in LLMs due to the high computational cost of existing techniques, which restricts practical applicability.

Method: The proposed SSS algorithm uses a reward-shifted speculative sampling approach, pairing an aligned draft model with a standard target model and modifying acceptance criteria to recover optimal RLHF solutions.

Result: SSS demonstrated reduced inference costs and superior reward scores during test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The SSS algorithm addresses the efficiency bottleneck in test-time alignment of LLMs, maintaining alignment performance while significantly lowering computational costs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall introduces a framework for evaluating recall in machine-generated text by breaking down answers into facts, filtering candidates, and verifying alignment. This improves recall accuracy, addressing issues with lexical overlap and paraphrased answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing errors in recall evaluation caused by reliance on lexical overlap and paraphrasing in critical domains like medicine and law.

Method: A three-stage framework: (1) decomposition into self-contained facts, (2) filtering candidate matches (lexical and semantic), and (3) structured entailment verification.

Result: Testing on long-form QA benchmarks showed improved recall accuracy, reducing false positives and negatives compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: LongRecall provides a robust approach to systematic recall assessment, enhancing reliability in diverse phrasing and contexts.

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [52] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes combining LLMs with combinatorial inference to enhance consistency and accuracy in structured prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of hallucinations and complex reasoning in LLMs by improving structured prediction capabilities.

Method: Integrate LLMs with symbolic inference and explore prompting strategies, calibration, and fine-tuning for structured prediction tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate improved consistency and accuracy using symbolic inference, as well as better performance with structured prediction techniques.

Conclusion: Structured learning and inference remain valuable for improving LLM performance in challenging tasks, complementing their predictive capabilities.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pretraining LLMs on high-quality mathematical data significantly improves reasoning. Nemotron-CC-Math addresses degraded math dataset quality issues by introducing a robust extraction pipeline, producing state-of-the-art datasets boosting model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math-focused datasets suffer from issues like low-quality data extraction, inconsistent formatting, and poor preservation of mathematical structure, limiting their utility for enhancing LLM reasoning.

Method: The authors developed a domain-agnostic pipeline leveraging layout-aware rendering tools and LLM-based cleaning stages to robustly extract and standardize mathematical content into high-quality LaTeX representations.

Result: The resulting datasets, Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens), outperform prior open math datasets in quality and scale, providing significant model improvements in reasoning tasks (e.g., MATH, MBPP+, MMLU).

Conclusion: This work establishes an effective method for extracting high-quality scientific content from noisy web data and sets new benchmarks in math pretraining corpora, improving reasoning capabilities while supporting open-source efforts.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to handle questions with false assumptions using external evidence and fact verification, aiming to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate misleading answers due to hallucinations, particularly when answering questions containing false assumptions.

Method: The authors leverage external evidence and generate atomic assumptions to validate false premises, making answers more interpretable.

Result: Experiments using five LLMs show that retrieved evidence is beneficial and generating atomic assumptions improves accuracy while enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: Reducing questions to fact verification and external evidence retrieval improves handling false assumptions, mitigating LLM hallucinations effectively.

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in current Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for handling complex, multi-turn visually-grounded tasks by introducing MMDR-Bench and a new framework, CoLVLM Agent, which outperforms existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in LLMs and LVLMs, there are challenges in managing multi-turn, visually-grounded tasks requiring reasoning, entity tracking, and context retention, while existing benchmarks fail to capture these complexities effectively.

Method: The authors propose MMDR-Bench, a dataset with intricate multi-turn dialogue scenarios, and CoLVLM Agent, a framework applying a 'memory-perception-planning-execution' cycle that enhances reasoning without retraining base models.

Result: Experiments show CoLVLM Agent achieves higher human evaluation scores (4.03) than state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly excelling in reasoning depth and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: The MMDR-Bench dataset and CoLVLM framework demonstrate a significant step forward in multi-modal dialogue task handling, establishing their efficacy for sustained multi-turn interactions and complex reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [56] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken introduces a semantic-aware tokenization technique to reduce token redundancy and improve computational efficiency by clustering semantically similar tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tokenization methods like BPE focus on frequency-based mechanisms, often ignoring semantic structures, causing inefficiencies in long-context textual data processing.

Method: SemToken utilizes lightweight encoders to extract semantic embeddings, performs local clustering to reduce redundancy, and applies variable token granularity based on semantic density.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SemToken reduces token counts by up to 2.4x and computation time by 1.9x with minimal or no accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: Semantic structures hold potential for optimizing tokenization and enhancing the performance of large language models without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Fin-PRM, a domain-specific reward model tailored for financial reasoning, achieving substantial accuracy improvements over general PRMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models are inadequate for domain-specific tasks, particularly in finance, where reasoning is structured, symbolic, and factually sensitive.

Method: The authors developed Fin-PRM, a trajectory-aware model integrating step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision, supporting offline/online reward learning for tasks like distillation, reinforcement learning, and inference.

Result: Fin-PRM outperformed general PRMs and financial baselines, with notable performance boosts of up to 12.9% in supervised learning, 5.2% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1% at test time.

Conclusion: Fin-PRM showcases the effectiveness of domain-specialized reward models in aligning LLMs with structured expert-level reasoning in finance.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK is a method to efficiently handle long-context inference in large language models by applying unstructured pruning at the channel level in KV caches, improving memory efficiency and preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context inference methods in LLMs face a memory bottleneck due to the linear growth of KV cache storage with sequence length and quadratic scaling of attention computation. Existing compression methods fail to account for the varying importance of feature dimensions.

Method: SPARK applies dynamic unstructured sparsity by pruning KV entries at the channel dimension while restoring pruned information during attention computation. This is a plug-and-play, training-free approach compatible with other methods like compression or quantization.

Result: SPARK reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods while maintaining or improving accuracy for sequences of equal length. When pruning 80% of data, it still limits performance degradation to less than 5%.

Conclusion: SPARK provides a memory-efficient solution for long-context inference in LLMs, complementing existing compression methods and improving memory utilization without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Motivation: LLMs excel at general QA tasks but face challenges in domain-specific applications due to limitations in acquiring and utilizing domain knowledge.

Method: The proposed S2K framework uses an internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy, selective supervised fine-tuning, and a structured reasoning data generation pipeline integrated with GRPO for better reasoning.

Result: S2K outperforms existing methods across benchmarks in medical, legal, and financial QA, delivering similar results as domain-pretrained LLMs but at a significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: S2K showcases that progressive and structured knowledge acquisition can cost-effectively address performance gaps in domain-specific QA tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

### [60] [Self-Guided Function Calling in Large Language Models via Stepwise Experience Recall](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15214)
*Sijia Cui,Aiyao He,Shuai Xu,Hongming Zhang,Yanna Wang,Qingyang Zhang,Yajing Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SEER, a method for improving multi-step tool usage in LLMs by using dynamic retrieval of past successful experiences, ultimately enhancing performance in tool-chain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enabling LLMs to use tools suffer from inefficiencies in tool selection and task planning, relying heavily on static, curated libraries or manual designs which struggle to scale with task complexity.

Method: SEER utilizes a self-guided strategy to continuously update an experience pool with stepwise successful trajectories, allowing models to dynamically retrieve and leverage these experiences.

Result: SEER outperforms existing models in tool-chain planning tasks, achieving notable accuracy improvements on benchmarks like ToolQA and real-world datasets such as Ï-bench.

Conclusion: The adaptive experience recall mechanism of SEER helps LLMs efficiently navigate complex, multi-step tool scenarios, proving to be a scalable and effective solution for improving model performance over time.

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

### [61] [Are Checklists Really Useful for Automatic Evaluation of Generative Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15218)
*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the accuracy of using checklist-based evaluations for generative tasks conducted by large language models and finds selective checklist use benefits pairwise comparisons but performs less reliably in direct scoring methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative tasks evaluated by large language models face challenges from ambiguous criteria, necessitating better tools to improve evaluation standardization.

Method: Authors use six methods to generate evaluation checklists, analyze their effectiveness across eight model sizes, and assess correlations with human evaluations in pairwise and direct scoring tasks.

Result: Selective checklist use improves performance in pairwise evaluations but shows inconsistent benefits in direct scoring. Correlations between checklist items and human judgment highlight the inconsistencies in human evaluations.

Conclusion: Clear and objective criteria are needed for evaluation frameworks in both human and automatic settings, emphasizing the role of consistent tools such as checklists.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

### [62] [VocabTailor: Dynamic Vocabulary Selection for Downstream Tasks in Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15229)
*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes VocabTailor, a framework for dynamic vocabulary management in small language models, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the memory constraints of small language models on edge devices, especially stemming from large vocabulary components, where existing pruning techniques are ineffective and inflexible.

Method: The authors design VocabTailor, which leverages dynamic vocabulary selection using a hybrid static-dynamic strategy. It offloads embedding and uses on-demand loading mechanisms for vocabulary components.

Result: The framework reduces memory usage of vocabulary-related components by up to 99% across various tasks without significant loss in performance.

Conclusion: VocabTailor effectively addresses memory bottlenecks in small language models, outperforming earlier static pruning methods by yielding high memory efficiency and retaining task accuracy.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces WangchanThaiInstruct, a human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction-tuning of large language models, demonstrating superior performance for Thai tasks compared to using translated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of performance of large language models (LLMs) in handling low-resource languages like Thai, which are often not given culturally and professionally specific instruction data.

Method: The authors developed WangchanThaiInstruct, a Thai dataset by engaging Thai annotators, domain experts, and researchers to ensure high-quality data. They performed two studies: a zero-shot evaluation of performance gaps and an instruction tuning study, focusing on native supervision effects.

Result: LLMs fine-tuned with WangchanThaiInstruct exhibited superior performance on Thai-specific tasks in comparison to models trained using translated data, both within-domain and out-of-domain.

Conclusion: Culturally and professionally specific instruction datasets like WangchanThaiInstruct are crucial for improving LLM alignment and performance in low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

*Sangmin Lee,Woojin Chung,Seyun Um,Hong-Goo Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces UniCoM, a method to generate natural code-switching (CS) speech data to address challenges in multilingual speech technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the underexplored issue of creating systems for managing code-switching in multilingual speech technologies, which is difficult due to the lack of appropriate datasets.

Method: UniCoM generates CS samples using the SWORDS algorithm, replacing selected words with translations while maintaining sentence semantics. The output, CS-FLEURS, is a multilingual CS dataset for ASR and S2TT tasks.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that CS-FLEURS is both intelligible and natural, with performance comparable to existing datasets.

Conclusion: The UniCoM pipeline and the CS-FLEURS dataset can drive advancements in code-switching speech technology, promoting more inclusive multilingual systems.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces EMNLP, a framework for profiling LLMs in educator roles and assessing their ethical and psychological behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation for LLMs simulating professional roles, particularly in the education domain.

Method: The authors developed EMNLP, which extends existing scales, constructs teacher-specific moral dilemmas, and applies soft prompt injection to assess teacher-role LLMs.

Result: Experiments show LLMs emulate teacher roles with idealized personalities, excel in moral reasoning, but struggle with emotional complexity; higher reasoning models are more vulnerable to harmful prompts.

Conclusion: The study provides the first benchmark for ethical and psychological alignment in teacher-role LLMs, highlighting the trade-off between capability and safety.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

*Eunseong Choi,June Park,Hyeri Lee,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE introduces mechanisms to address conflicts between external context and an LLM's parametric memory, improving retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of context-memory conflict in RAG systems, where external retrieved data contradicts the built-in parametric knowledge of LLMs.

Method: The proposed CARE system uses a context assessor and adversarial soft prompting to evaluate and guide reasoning toward the most reliable knowledge source.

Result: Experiments indicate CARE reduces context-memory conflicts, achieving an average performance improvement of 5.0% on QA and fact-checking tasks.

Conclusion: CARE enhances RAG systems by making them more trustworthy and adaptable, establishing a promising advancement in leveraging external knowledge sources.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to mine temporal commonsense for events, proposing a pipeline that constructs a validated temporal dataset (TComQA) with over 80% precision and improves model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal commonsense for events is often not explicitly mentioned in natural language but critical for reasoning, posing challenges for LLMs.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline leveraging LLMs to automatically extract temporal commonsense from text, creating and crowdsourcing validation for the TComQA dataset.

Result: The TComQA dataset demonstrates over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense, and a model trained with TComQA outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on an existing temporal question answering dataset.

Conclusion: Mining temporal commonsense improves LLMâs reasoning and performance, as demonstrated by the proposed pipeline and validated dataset (TComQA).

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: The paper presents CUPE, a lightweight phoneme recognition model excelling in cross-lingual tasks with compact 120ms window processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a model for phoneme recognition that is context-independent and captures universal phonetic features for speech processing.

Method: Proposed CUPE processes short 120ms windows, uses fewer parameters, and trains via supervised and self-supervised learning for robust cross-lingual representation.

Result: CUPE shows competitive performance across languages, with strong generalization including zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus.

Conclusion: A universal phoneme recognition model can be achieved by focusing on fundamental acoustic patterns within phoneme-length frames, making effective cross-lingual speech processing feasible.

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

Motivation: The motivation is to analyze the growing diversity and importance of evaluation benchmarks for large language models as a tool to measure performance, guide development, and foster innovation.

Method: The authors systematically review and classify 283 representative benchmarks into three typesâgeneral capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specificâwhile identifying current issues and proposing design paradigms.

Result: The benchmarks were categorized effectively, and significant limitations in current benchmarks such as biases and credibility issues were identified.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the critical need for innovative benchmark designs to overcome present challenges like cultural biases and emphasizes the potential for benchmarks to guide future model development.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the reliability and risks of MLLMs, particularly those introduced by their multimodal nature, and to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluation and improvement.

Method: MultiTrust-X includes a three-dimensional framework incorporating trustworthiness aspects, risk types, and mitigation strategies, alongside 32 evaluation tasks, 28 datasets, and a novel RESA approach.

Result: Current MLLMs show significant vulnerabilities, including amplified risks from multimodal interactions and limited effectiveness of existing mitigation methods, with unexpected trade-offs and gaps in overall trustworthiness.

Conclusion: MultiTrust-X reveals critical trustworthiness issues in existing MLLMs and offers actionable insights alongside a RESA-based strategy to improve balance between safety and performance.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an adaptive speculative decoding method that enhances speed and output quality in language models by using confidence-based mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods are limited by static drafting lengths and rigid verification criteria, lacking adaptability across variable uncertainties and input complexity.

Method: An information-theoretic speculative decoding approach is developed using entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures to dynamically adjust token drafting and verification processes.

Result: Experiments demonstrate notable speedups and preservation or improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores for tasks like machine translation and summarization.

Conclusion: The method provides a principled, efficient, and adaptable framework for robust decoding in large language models under diverse uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies the effects of larger vocabularies in training language models and concludes that reducing text complexity via vocabulary size improves model performance on frequent words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why increasing vocabulary size in language models improves their performance and clarify the mechanisms behind this benefit.

Method: Conducts a controlled study by scaling vocabulary size while keeping data, compute, and optimization unchanged, analyzes tokenized text complexity using Kolmogorov complexity, tests cross-entropy changes for frequent and rare words, and evaluates embedding constraints and their effects.

Result: Larger vocabularies primarily reduce uncertainty for the most frequent words, transferring benefits to downstream tasks, and embedding constraints demonstrate that the advantage comes from exploiting token-frequency imbalance.

Conclusion: The benefits of larger vocabularies are better understood as reductions in tokenized text complexity, which can be used as a clear guideline for tokenizer and model co-design in language model pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Motivation: Growing concerns about the reliability of LLM outputs due to their insufficient traceability and verifiability.

Method: Systematic analysis of 134 papers, introduction of a unified taxonomy, and evaluation of 300 metrics across seven dimensions in evidence-based text generation approaches.

Result: Identification of distinctive characteristics, representative methods, open challenges, and promising research directions in evidence-based text generation.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework to unify fragmented research on evidence-based text generation and facilitate further advancements in reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics

TL;DR: This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, a benchmark for studying how large audio-language models (LALMs) handle inconsistent audio-text inputs, revealing a bias toward text and proposing mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexamined area of how LALMs handle conflicting information between audio and text modalities, investigating their biases and reliability for real-world applications.

Method: The study develops MCR-BENCH as a benchmark, conducts extensive evaluations across audio understanding tasks, explores supervised finetuning, and analyzes confidence patterns in LALMs.

Result: LALMs show a significant bias for textual input over audio evidence, leading to performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and persistent overconfidence despite contradictory inputs.

Conclusion: Better modality balance during training and improved fusion mechanisms are essential to enhance robustness and reliability in multimodal situations involving conflicting inputs.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

*Yirong Sun,Yizhong Geng,Peidong Wei,Yanjun Chen,Jinghan Yang,Rongfei Chen,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaSO is a fully open framework for large speech-language modeling, offering datasets, benchmarks, and a reference model to advance unified and transparent LSLM research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the fragmentation and lack of transparency in the LSLM field, as well as the common absence of training data and configurations when releasing model weights.

Method: The authors introduce LLaSO, an end-to-end framework consisting of LLaSO-Align (speech-text alignment corpus), LLaSO-Instruct (multi-task instruction-tuning dataset), and LLaSO-Eval (evaluation benchmark). They also provide a reference model trained exclusively on public data.

Result: The LLaSO-Base reference model achieves a normalized score of 0.72, outperforming comparable models and establishing a reproducible baseline.

Conclusion: LLaSO serves as an open standard, delivering the resources needed to unify LSLM research and accelerate progress by making the framework, datasets, benchmarks, and models publicly available.

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

*Mohammad Ibrahim Qani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses how to professionally render non-equivalent words from source to target languages, introducing methods and demonstrating with 25 examples between Uzbek, English, and Russian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and overcome misunderstandings arising from non-equivalent words between languages, enabling better translation accuracy.

Method: Library-based research focusing on identifying and rendering 25 non-equivalent words between Dar & Uzbek languages into English and Russian.

Result: Successful rendering of 25 non-equivalent words using proposed methods, along with introducing rules for handling such words professionally.

Conclusion: Development of practical methods to address non-equivalent words enhances translation quality and understanding between languages, though further work is needed for a comprehensive approach.

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyTOD, a task-oriented dialogue system that uses executable code and feedback for accurate state tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a key benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-oriented dialogue agents heavily rely on accurate state tracking to implement structured policies, but existing methods face challenges in error correction and robustness as the dialogue progresses.

Method: PyTOD utilizes a constrained decoding mechanism powered by a language model to generate executable state-tracking code. It employs a novel feedback loop between policy and execution for efficient error correction.

Result: PyTOD achieved state-of-the-art results on the SGD benchmark, outperforming strong baselines in both accuracy and user goal estimation robustness over time.

Conclusion: Execution-aware state tracking significantly enhances the performance and reliability of task-oriented dialogue agents. PyTOD demonstrates such improvements and sets a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

### [80] [RadReason: Radiology Report Evaluation Metric with Reasons and Sub-Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15464)
*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadReason is proposed as a novel evaluation framework for radiology reports that provides fine-grained sub-scores across six error types along with human-readable justifications for each score, addressing the limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of evaluating automatically generated radiology reports, which lack clinically relevant, interpretable, and fine-grained metrics. Current methods are either too coarse or rely on black-box models, making them unsuitable for clinical workflows.

Method: The proposed method, RadReason, uses Group Relative Policy Optimization with two innovations: Sub-score Dynamic Weighting to prioritize clinically challenging errors adaptively, and Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling for policy updates based on prompt difficulty. This ensures stable optimization and better alignment with clinical judgments.

Result: RadReason outperforms previous offline metrics, matches GPT-4-based evaluations in quality, and introduces explainability, cost-efficiency, and clinical suitability. The framework's success was demonstrated on the ReXVal benchmark.

Conclusion: RadReason provides an advanced and interpretable tool for evaluating radiology reports, combining clinical alignment with computational efficiency. It addresses limitations in existing evaluation methods, making it practical for real-world use.

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

*Vedasamhitha Challapalli,Konduru Venkat Sai,Piyush Pratap Singh,Rupesh Prasad,Arvind Maurya,Atul Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation, achieving a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rates through a novel contrastive learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for highly effective personalized marketing strategies that enhance conversion rates and customer satisfaction while driving business growth.

Method: The authors developed SLM4Offer by fine-tuning Google's T5-Small encoder-decoder model using a contrastive learning approach with InfoNCE loss, enabling a shared embedding space for aligning customer personas with offers.

Result: Experiments on a synthetic dataset showed that SLM4Offer improved offer acceptance rates by 17 percent compared to a supervised fine-tuning baseline.

Conclusion: The SLM4Offer model demonstrates that leveraging contrastive learning for personalized marketing can significantly enhance offer effectiveness, presenting a promising direction in the field.

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

*Sai Sundaresan,Harshita Chopra,Atanu R. Sinha,Koustava Goswami,Nagasai Saketh Naidu,Raghav Karan,N Anushka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates whether a smaller, customized Language Model can better align with subjective user behaviors compared to a larger LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Examining the limitations of a generic LLM in modeling idiosyncratic user behaviors and preferences derived from browsing habits.

Method: Proposed clusterwise LM training called HeTLM, utilizing a page-level tokenizer and heterogeneous cluster-specific parameters to represent diverse user behaviors.

Result: Small LMs outperform large pre-trained ones; HeTLM shows superior performance and alignment across different user clusters; ensures higher average performance with less variance.

Conclusion: Heterogeneity-aware language model training is more effective for applications requiring alignment with subjective behaviors, challenging the notion that large LLMs are universally better.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines curriculum learning for language model pre-training and finds it effective when example difficulty is measured by training data influence rather than human-centric metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether curriculum learning becomes effective by replacing conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with a model-centric metric based on training data influence.

Method: Training examples are sorted based on their training data influence, which estimates their impact on the model's output during training.

Result: Models trained using this curriculum learning strategy exceed random-order-trained models by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning is effective for language model pre-training when a model-centric difficulty metric like training data influence is used.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

*Guy Mor-Lan,Naama Rivlin-Angert,Yael R. Kaplan,Tamir Sheafer,Shaul R. Shenhav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection using Israeli politicians' Facebook posts. It analyzes identity portrayals, benchmarks detection methods, and compares elite vs. public identity priorities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political language is closely tied to social identities, but existing datasets for identity detection are limited to English, single-label classifications, and broad categories. The paper aims to fill this gap by creating a more nuanced, Hebrew-centric dataset.

Method: The authors developed HebID, a dataset of 5,536 sentences from politicians' Facebook posts, annotated for twelve specific social identities. They benchmarked identity detection with various models, including generative Hebrew-tuned LLMs.

Result: Hebrew-tuned large language models outperformed others with a macro-$F_1$ score of 0.74. The classifier was used to evaluate identity expression in posts and speeches, analyzing popularity, temporal, clustering, and gender patterns.

Conclusion: HebID offers a robust resource for studying multicultural political identities and provides insights into discrepancies between public and elite identity narratives in Hebrew. This approach may inspire research in other non-English political settings.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

TL;DR: Dream 7B is a diffusion-based large language model that outperforms others in various tasks and supports flexible generation and quality-speed adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To surpass the performance of existing autoregressive (AR) and diffusion language models by introducing a more versatile and capable system.

Method: Implemented a discrete diffusion model with AR-based LLM initialization and token-level noise rescheduling, releasing two versions: Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct.

Result: Dream 7B outperformed other diffusion models across multiple domains and showcased advanced capabilities such as flexible generation and tunable trade-offs.

Conclusion: Dream 7B advances the state-of-the-art in diffusion-based language modeling, offering tools for further research and practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

### [86] [The Enemy from Within: A Study of Political Delegitimization Discourse in Israeli Political Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15524)
*Naama Rivlin-Angert,Guy Mor-Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study presents a large-scale computational analysis of political delegitimization discourse (PDD) using a newly curated Hebrew corpus combined with advanced machine learning techniques. It finds increasing trends in PDD over the years, especially on social media and among certain actor demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to analyze and better understand political delegitimization discourse (PDD), a phenomenon where political entities face symbolic attacks undermining their normative validity, with an emphasis on its prevalence and evolution in democratic discourse.

Method: A new Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences from parliamentary speeches, social media, and news was annotated for PDD and other characteristics. The authors employed a two-stage classification pipeline using finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs to detect and classify PDD effectively.

Result: The optimized model achieved an F$_1$ score of 0.74 for PDD detection and macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for characteristics classification. Analysis showed increasing PDD trends across decades, particularly on social media, with significant spikes during elections and political events.

Conclusion: Automated PDD analysis not only shows the progression and different tendencies of PDD across mediums and demographics but also highlights its impact on understanding democratic discourse in a systematic, quantifiable way.

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

TL;DR: SafetyFlow introduces the first fully automated system for constructing LLM safety benchmarks, reducing time and resource costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety benchmarks for LLMs require manual efforts, leading to inefficiencies, redundancy, and limited difficulty.

Method: SafetyFlow employs seven specialized agents in an agent-flow system to automate the construction of safety benchmarks, integrating human expertise via versatile tools.

Result: SafetyFlowBench, a dataset with 23,446 queries, is created in just four days, featuring low redundancy and high discriminative power.

Conclusion: SafetyFlow streamlines benchmarking for LLM safety evaluations, making the process efficient and comprehensive with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally expensive and not cost-effective for targeted applications, such as sales and marketing.

Method: Develop and fine-tune Small Language Models specifically for high-value application domains.

Result: SLMs achieved domain-specific text generation comparable to LLMs but at much lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning small models is a practical approach for application-specific use cases, substantially reducing resource demands.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these
creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep
cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing
outreach, these costs are far from feasible. This paper introduces the concept
of "Trained Miniatures" - Small Language Models(SLMs) fine-tuned for specific,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights a safety issue in LLMs, presenting SDGO, a framework to improve generation safety by leveraging their discrimination capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the safety inconsistency in LLMs, where they identify harmful requests better than they defend against generating harmful content.

Method: Introduce SDGO, a reinforcement learning method using the model's inherent discrimination as a reward signal to improve generation safety without requiring additional data or external tools.

Result: Experiments show that SDGO enhances model safety against jailbreaking attacks while preserving general usefulness, with robust performance against out-of-distribution attacks.

Conclusion: SDGO effectively aligns discrimination and generation capabilities in LLMs, improving safety with minimal discriminative samples, making it a practical approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Motivation: With the expanding volume of academic literature, manually creating scientific surveys has become impractical, necessitating automated approaches. However, progress is stunted by the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluation.

Method: SurGE, a new benchmark, is developed with test instances consisting of expert-written surveys, full reference sets, and a large academic corpus of over one million papers. An automated evaluation framework assessing information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality is also proposed.

Result: The study found that even advanced LLM-based approaches struggle with the complexity of survey generation, demonstrating significant limitations in current capabilities.

Conclusion: Survey generation remains a significant challenge for AI models, underscoring the need for further research and development in this field. SurGE, as a benchmark, is a critical step forward and has been made open-source for community use.

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

*Yifei Wang,Feng Xiong,Yong Wang,Linjing Li,Xiangxiang Chu,Daniel Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses positional bias (PB) in long-context understanding by introducing Pos2Distill, a knowledge distillation framework that transfers strengths from favorable positions to weaker ones. It includes two task-specific versions to enhance retrieval and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to mitigate the significant performance issues caused by positional bias, which hampers the ability to understand and process long contexts effectively.

Method: A position-to-position knowledge distillation framework (Pos2Distill) is introduced. The approach leverages the strengths of advantageous positions to improve weaker ones, with specialized versions designed for retrieval (R1) and reasoning (R2) tasks.

Result: The framework enhances performance consistency across all contextual positions and achieves significant gains in long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. The specialized systems demonstrate strong cross-task generalization and top-tier performance on their specific tasks.

Conclusion: Pos2Distill effectively reduces positional bias by leveraging its innate disparities, improving long-context understanding tasks through consistent gains and robust generalization across different paradigms.

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

*Abhijit Paul,Mashiat Amin Farin,Sharif Md. Abdullah,Ahmedul Kabir,Zarif Masud,Shebuti Rayana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limited digital resources in Bangla language processing, specifically focusing on stemming techniques and their challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla language, despite its global significance, faces digital under-representation due to limited annotated datasets and stemming challenges for its highly-inflectional nature.

Method: The paper surveys existing Bangla stemming approaches, critiques their gaps and evaluation methodologies, and explores the unique challenges posed by Bangla's morphology.

Result: It reveals significant gaps in current stemming research, including lack of reliable methodologies and accessible implementations, impacting Bangla language processing.

Conclusion: The paper calls for the development of robust stemming techniques, improved evaluation methods, and sustained research to enhance Bangla language processing capabilities.

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

### [93] [EcomMMMU: Strategic Utilization of Visuals for Robust Multimodal E-Commerce Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15721)
*Xinyi Ling,Hanwen Du,Zhihui Zhu,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges with multimodal data in e-commerce by introducing a dataset (EcomMMMU) and proposing a method (SUMEI) for effective utilization of product images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal data is abundant in e-commerce platforms, but the role of images in improving or degrading understanding hasn't been systematically studied due to limitations in existing datasets.

Method: The authors developed EcomMMMU, a large-scale multimodal dataset, and proposed SUMEI, a method predicting visual utility before leveraging images in downstream tasks.

Result: Analysis using EcomMMMU shows that product images don't always improve performance and may degrade it. SUMEI proved effective in predicting and utilizing image contributions.

Conclusion: MLLMs struggle with leveraging visual content in e-commerce tasks. SUMEI offers a robust solution for better handling multimodal data.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

TL;DR: Deep-DxSearch introduces an agentic reinforcement learning framework for traceable, retrieval-augmented reasoning tailored to medical diagnoses, demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy compared with existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in medical LLMs such as hallucinations and weak external knowledge utilization, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy with a traceable and reasoning-focused system.

Method: Deep-DxSearch uses reinforcement learning to train a retrieval-augmented reasoning system, leveraging patient records and medical knowledge, and refining diagnostic accuracy with tailored rewards.

Result: The framework outperformed prompt-engineering and training-free RAG methods, achieving higher diagnostic accuracy than established baselines like GPT-4o and other medical-specific systems, particularly for diverse disease settings.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates significant improvements in diagnostic reasoning and accuracy, providing a tool for more reliable preliminary diagnoses, supported by experiments, ablation studies, and interpretability analyses.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

TL;DR: ReasonZoo benchmarks the effectiveness of Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) in enhancing reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), showcasing superior performance and efficiency in various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with precise computations even in reasoning tasks like chain-of-thought, prompting a need to evaluate how incorporating external tools via TIR impacts reasoning enhancement.

Method: The study created a benchmark called ReasonZoo with nine diverse reasoning categories and proposed two metricsâPAC and AUC-PCCâto evaluate reasoning efficiency of TIR models versus non-TIR ones.

Result: Empirical evidence shows TIR-enabled models outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and non-mathematical areas, improving reasoning efficiency while reducing overthinking.

Conclusion: TIR introduces domain-general benefits to reasoning tasks in LLMs, streamlining reasoning and expanding their capability to handle complex problems effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: The paper addresses a gap in benchmarking AI agents' ability to solve complex, multi-step tasks using diverse tools provided by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Method: The authors created LiveMCP-101, a set of 101 real-world queries requiring the use of MCP tools. They used iterative LLM rewriting and manual review for query refinement and employed an evaluation method based on ground-truth execution plans rather than raw API outputs.

Result: Experiments show that even advanced LLMs have a success rate below 60% on LiveMCP-101, alongside distinct failure modes and inefficiencies in token usage.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101 establishes a rigorous benchmark for assessing tool orchestration in AI models, driving progress toward dependable autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world

### [97] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Facial landmark detection, key in computer vision, traditionally uses a differentiable approximation (Soft-argmax) with heatmap regression for training. This paper proposes an alternative structured prediction approach, achieving state-of-the-art results faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the longstanding reliance on Soft-argmax in heatmap regression for facial landmark detection, aiming to explore alternative methods for improved performance.

Method: The authors propose a structured prediction framework as an alternative training objective, departing from the traditional Soft-argmax approach.

Result: Empirical evaluations show state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, 300W), with training converging 2.2x faster and maintaining competitive or superior accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed structured prediction method outperforms or matches traditional methods in accuracy while converging faster. This challenges the necessity of Soft-argmax for this task.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve image classification accuracy and efficiency by using innovative graph-based methods.

Method: The paper integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams by representing images as graphs refined through Delaunay triangulations.

Result: The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks, especially in complex scenes and with fine-grained categories.

Conclusion: Graph-based learning paradigms, such as the proposed method, show promise for advancing computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in

*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces YOPO, a unified single-stage RGB-only framework for object detection and category-level 9-DoF pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the process of object detection and pose estimation by creating an RGB-only method that eliminates reliance on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades.

Method: YOPO integrates a transformer detector with a pose head, a bounding box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost, ensuring end-to-end training using only RGB images and pose labels.

Result: YOPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks like REAL275, with 79.6% IoU$_{50}$ and 54.1% accuracy under a $10^	ext{o}$10cm metric, outperforming prior RGB-only approaches.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that high-performance unified object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation can be achieved using a single RGB image without additional data, significantly advancing the field.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified training approach for face anti-spoofing systems, addressing physical and digital attack vulnerabilities through modality-agnostic liveness cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to physical and digital spoofing attacks, and traditional methods require separate detectors, increasing complexity and latency.

Method: The authors propose a Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that uses automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn generalized liveness cues.

Result: Their method achieved an average classification error rate (ACER) of 2.10% in the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge benchmark, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient, accurate, and practical solution for real-world face anti-spoofing applications, with open-source code and pretrained models available.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen is a training-free black-box method for generating adversarial images efficiently using fewer sampling steps in diffusion models, while maintaining high visual quality and attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks from generative models often generate low-quality images, require long sampling steps, and are computationally expensive. The motivation behind this work is to overcome these limitations by creating a faster and more efficient solution.

Method: The method introduces TAIGen, which utilizes perturbations injected during selective steps of sampling in unconditional diffusion models. It develops a selective RGB channel strategy, focusing attention on specific color channels (red using attention maps; green and blue using GradCAM-guided perturbations) to maximize attack effectiveness while preserving visual quality.

Result: TAIGen improves efficiency by producing adversarial images in only 3-20 steps, often 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks. It achieves high success rates across different models (70.6% against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8% against ShuffleNet) and maintains image quality with PSNR above 30 dB.

Conclusion: TAIGen is a breakthrough in efficient adversarial image generation that balances computational efficiency, image quality, and impactful attack performance, making it a critical tool for exploring adversarial vulnerabilities and defenses.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RUN++, a reversible unfolding network combining reversible modeling and generative refinement to improve concealed visual perception (CVP) by optimizing segmentation accuracy across mask and RGB domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVP methods predominantly focus on mask domain reversible strategies and neglect the RGB domain's potential, hindering holistic segmentation and management of uncertainty.

Method: RUN++ unfolds a mathematical optimization problem into a multi-stage network integrating three modules: CORE for mask domain reversible modeling, CARE for RGB domain enhancement, and FINE introducing diffusion-based refinement targeting uncertain mask regions.

Result: RUN++ effectively reduces false positives and negatives in CVP by combining reversible modeling, contextual RGB refinement, and targeted generative noise enhancement.

Conclusion: This innovative framework demonstrates enhanced CVP performance, leveraging domain synergy and efficient bi-level optimization strategies to address real-world degradation challenges.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

### [104] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow improves text-to-image generation by introducing non-linear trajectory modeling using curvature guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on semantic alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how trajectory curvature affects semantic alignment between generated images and captions in text-to-image generation, aiming to improve alignment and image quality.

Method: CurveFlow utilizes non-linear trajectory modeling with curvature guidance via robust curvature regularization to penalize abrupt trajectory changes.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation on MS COCO datasets, outperforming both standard rectified flow methods and other non-linear baselines in semantic consistency metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating curvature-aware paths significantly enhances compliance with complex instructions and image quality in text-to-image generation models.

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is

*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management method to ensure reliable multi-view 3D reconstruction amidst system disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical applications like emergency response and public safety require real-time 3D reconstruction systems in dynamic edge environments prone to operational adversities.

Method: The strategy involves using portfolio theory principles and a genetic algorithm to optimize camera selection amidst spatiotemporal disruptions.

Result: The proposed methodology outperforms traditional baseline approaches, demonstrating improved 3D reconstruction reliability using publicly available and customized datasets.

Conclusion: The approach ensures 3D reconstruction quality even in disruptive edge environments, highlighting its practical importance in mission-critical applications.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA is a self-supervised and opinion-unaware framework for no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), achieving state-of-the-art performance without relying on external references or labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address dataset biases and the reliance on subjective labels in NR-IQA, which limit generalization performance.

Method: HiRQA employs hierarchical ranking and contrastive learning to develop quality-aware embeddings, introduces a higher-order ranking loss and embedding distance loss, and uses contrastive alignment with textual prompts. It predicts quality using only input images.

Result: HiRQA demonstrated effective generalization to various distortions, achieved state-of-the-art results across benchmarks, and introduced a lightweight variant (HiRQA-S) with rapid inference.

Conclusion: HiRQA offers a robust, scalable, and generalizable framework for NR-IQA, suitable for both synthetic and authentic distortions.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces XDR-LVLM, a framework using Vision-Language Large Models for accurate diabetic retinopathy detection and generating interpretable diagnostic reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness, and while deep learning models are effective, their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption.

Method: The proposed framework, XDR-LVML, combines a Medical Vision Encoder, LVLM core, and employs multi-task prompt engineering and multi-stage fine-tuning to analyze fundus images and produce natural language explanations.

Result: XDR-LVML achieved state-of-the-art performance with 84.55% Balanced Accuracy and 79.92% F1 Score for diagnosis, as well as high scores for concept detection. The generated diagnostic explanations were fluently and clinically validated by human evaluators.

Conclusion: XDR-LVML advances the field by providing an interpretable, accurate DR diagnosis solution that meets clinical needs, helping bridge the gap between automated tools and practical healthcare application.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

*Xuyang Chen,Zhijun Zhai,Kaixuan Zhou,Zengmao Wang,Jianan He,Dong Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,mingwei Sun,RÃ¼diger Westermann,Konrad Schindler,Liqiu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MeSS, a framework for synthesizing high-quality, visually consistent 3D outdoor scenes using city mesh models as geometric priors, while addressing limitations of existing image and video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mesh models for cities lack realistic textures, limiting their applications in urban navigation and autonomous driving.

Method: The proposed pipeline enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. It involves generating geometrically consistent sparse views, propagating intermediate dense views, and globally aligning visual inconsistencies. Additionally, a 3D Gaussian Splatting scene is reconstructed using Gaussian balls on mesh surfaces.

Result: The method surpasses existing techniques in terms of geometric alignment and visual quality. Synthesized scenes support relighting and style transfer for rendering in diverse styles.

Conclusion: MeSS effectively bridges the gap between city mesh models and high-quality textured scene generation, addressing visual limitations with innovative diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

*Arjun Srinivasan,Anubhav Paras,Aniket Bera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a learning-based approach to generate adversarial behaviors among rule-based agents in reinforcement learning, focusing on safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure reliable modeling of surrounding agents in safety-critical systems, as existing reinforcement learning setups often fail due to poorly modeled rule-based agents.

Method: Develop a learning-based framework to derive adversarial behaviors in rule-based agents, enabling identification of their vulnerabilities.

Result: Adversarial agents successfully reduced the cumulative rewards of rule-based agents, demonstrating the impact of derived adversarial behaviors.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of modeling robust behaviors for surrounding agents and highlights vulnerabilities in typical rule-based models through the adversarial approach.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

*Leiyue Zhao,Yuechen Yang,Yanfan Zhu,Haichun Yang,Yuankai Huo,Paul D. Simonson,Kenji Ikemura,Mert R. Sabuncu,Yihe Yang,Ruining Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline, DyMorph-B2I, for accurately converting binary segmentation masks into instance-level masks in renal pathology analysis, overcoming limitations of conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing methods for segmenting renal pathology rely on binary (semantic) masks, which limit the precision of morphological quantifications.

Method: DyMorph-B2I combines watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations in a unified framework, supplemented by adaptive geometric refinements and hyperparameter tuning tailored to various renal functional units.

Result: The proposed method improves instance-level segmentation accuracy by robustly separating complex structures in binary masks, outperforming traditional techniques.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I enables more precise morphological quantifications of renal pathology, enhancing downstream analyses. The pipeline is publicly accessible for further adoption and utility.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAGNet, a model leveraging spatio-temporal features and recurrent networks to predict accidents using dash-cam video feeds, achieving superior metrics compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve road safety by developing cost-effective accident prediction systems using dash-cam video inputs instead of expensive sensor setups.

Method: The proposed STAGNet model utilizes enhanced spatio-temporal features, which are processed via a recurrent network for accident prediction. The approach builds upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

Result: When evaluated on three public datasets, STAGNet demonstrated higher average precision and improved mean time-to-collision measurements, surpassing existing methods both in cross-validation and across different datasets.

Conclusion: STAGNet offers a significant advancement in accident prediction from dash-cam video feeds, outperforming previous solutions in precision and deployability.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM introduces a multi-modal 3D generative model leveraging RGB, RGBD, and point cloud data to improve the texture and geometry of generated 3D assets efficiently, even with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D generative architectures operate within single-modality frameworks, neglecting the benefits of combining modalities like RGB, RGBD, and point clouds for holistic 3D asset modeling.

Method: TriMM combines collaborative multi-modal coding, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision mechanisms, and a triplane latent diffusion model to process and generate high-quality 3D assets.

Result: TriMM achieves competitive performance compared to models trained on large datasets and successfully utilizes small-scale data for effective 3D generation with enhanced texture and geometry.

Conclusion: TriMM demonstrates its capability in integrating multi-modal data sources for robust and high-quality 3D asset generation, making it feasible to employ diverse modalities in effectively advancing 3D modeling research.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

*Shihao Dong,Xiaotong Zhou,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework to address class conflict issues, employing soft prototype contrast and dual consistency learning modules for improved clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for clustering suffer from inter-class conflicts and inaccurate hard prototype computation, leading to suboptimal clustering representations.

Method: The paper proposes two modules: a soft prototype contrastive module to compute weighted soft prototypes minimizing conflicts, and a dual consistency learning module to enforce transformation-invariance and intra-cluster compactness.

Result: Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates inter-class conflicts, reduces prototype drift, and provides improved clustering consistency and representation quality.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dual-Altitude UAV Collaborative Vision-and-Language Navigation (DuAl-VLN), a task where high and low-altitude UAVs collaborate to navigate based on natural language and visual information. It introduces the AeroDuo framework and a new dataset, HaL-13k, to train and evaluate navigation in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable UAVs to reliably navigate complex outdoor environments using natural language instructions and visual cues, while leveraging UAVs' multi-grained perspectives for dynamic task management and minimizing learning difficulties.

Method: The approach uses two UAVs at different altitudes: a high-altitude UAV for broad environmental reasoning using a multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) and a low-altitude UAV for detailed navigation and target grounding using a lightweight multi-stage policy. They communicate with minimal coordinate exchange for efficiency.

Result: The development of the HaL-13k dataset allows training and evaluation in novel environments. Additionally, the AeroDuo framework facilitates enhanced collaboration and navigation performance between the two UAVs.

Conclusion: Combining high-level reasoning with precise navigation using dual UAVs improves navigation reliability while reducing human intervention and detailed instructional needs. The study introduces practical and scalable methods for UAV-VLN in real-world applications.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

*Wenju Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a skipped-step sampling method to accelerate diffusion models' generation process while preserving quality, avoiding non-Markovian adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of long-sequence step-by-step generation in diffusion models, while investigating if the original Markovian diffusion process can achieve faster sampling without resorting to non-Markovian methods like DDIM.

Method: The skipped-step sampling mechanism bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps during the generation process while adhering to the same training objective as standard diffusion models. Additionally, the method is integrated with DDIM for enhanced performance.

Result: The proposed method achieves high-quality outputs with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrated through experiments on models like OpenAI ADM and Stable Diffusion.

Conclusion: The study confirms the intrinsic property of accelerated sampling in pretrained diffusion models and highlights the effectiveness of skipped-step sampling combined with DDIM.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image codecs rely heavily on manual selections and are limited in their coding modes, making them less accessible for non-experts.

Method: The approach integrates a multi-functional coding framework, augmented in-context learning for decision-making by the LLM agent, and the creation of IIC-bench for evaluation purposes.

Result: Comp-X demonstrates effective understanding of user coding requests and strong textual interaction capabilities while maintaining competitive compression performance.

Conclusion: Comp-X represents a step forward in utilizing AGI for image compression, providing intelligent, flexible, and user-friendly operation.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly detection methods struggle with pathology images due to limited disease-related data, diverse tissue structures, and poor interpretability.

Method: Ano-NAViLa combines a pre-trained vision-language model with a trainable lightweight MLP, leveraging pathology-specific knowledge to enhance detection performance and interpretability.

Result: This method outperforms existing models in anomaly detection and localization tasks on lymph node datasets.

Conclusion: Ano-NAViLa represents a significant advancement for pathology anomaly detection, balancing high accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue
structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we
propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,
outperforming competing models.

Motivation: To address limitations in topology reasoning caused by restricted supervision range and improve the ability to model connections among lanes and traffic elements.

Method: The authors restructure the Transformer decoder layers and introduce multiple parallel cross-attention mechanisms to achieve one-to-many assignment and enhance geometry diversity.

Result: RATopo consistently and significantly improves lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance in experiments conducted on OpenLane-V2.

Conclusion: RATopo's model-agnostic approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing frameworks, offering enhanced topology reasoning performance.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

*Zhu Wang,Homaira Huda Shomee,Sathya N. Ravi,Sourav Medya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DesignCLIP, a framework leveraging vision-language models (CLIP) for design patent analysis, significantly improving tasks like classification and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional patent analysis relying on image data often fails due to a lack of semantic richness and visual context, hindering accurate evaluation during prior art searches.

Method: DesignCLIP incorporates CLIP models with class-aware classification, contrastive learning, and detailed caption generation, validated on diverse tasks with a U.S design patents dataset.

Result: DesignCLIP outperformed baseline and SOTA models in tasks like patent classification, retrieval, and multimodal patent analysis.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches, such as DesignCLIP, hold significant potential to advance patent analysis, enhance creativity, and foster innovation.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

### [120] [TPA: Temporal Prompt Alignment for Fetal Congenital Heart Defect Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15298)
*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA), a novel method for classifying fetal congenital heart defects (CHD) in ultrasound videos using temporal modeling, contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification for improved accuracy and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CHD detection in ultrasound videos is challenging due to noise, variability in probe positioning, and reliance on binary classification methods, lacking temporal analysis and calibration.

Method: TPA uses frame-wise feature extraction with an image encoder, temporal aggregation via a trained extractor, and hinge-margin contrastive loss to align video features with text prompts. It incorporates a CVAESM module for embedding modulation and uncertainty assessment.

Result: TPA achieves state-of-the-art results with 85.40% macro F1 score for CHD diagnosis and improved calibration metrics. On EchoNet-Dynamic, it improves macro F1 by 4.73% for systolic dysfunction detection.

Conclusion: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) enhances the reliability and performance of CHD classification in ultrasound videos by integrating advanced modeling, learning strategies, and uncertainty estimation techniques.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

*Ryunosuke Hayashi,Kohei Torimi,Rokuto Nagata,Kazuma Ikeda,Ozora Sako,Taichi Nakamura,Masaki Tani,Yoshimitsu Aoki,Kentaro Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the BasketLiDAR, a basketball-specific multimodal dataset combining LiDAR point clouds and multi-view camera footage to improve 3D player tracking accuracy in real-time. The dataset includes synchronized data from professional games and is integrated with a novel tracking algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Player tracking in sports like basketball faces challenges due to occlusion, rapid player movements, and the limitations of traditional multi-camera setups. Real-time solutions for accurate 3D trajectory tracking are needed.

Method: The authors developed BasketLiDAR by recording games using synchronized LiDAR sensors and multi-view cameras. This dataset supports a novel MOT algorithm leveraging LiDAR's precision to improve tracking. Two pipelinesâLiDAR-only and multimodal fusionâwere implemented.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method enables real-time tracking with high accuracy, even under challenging occlusion scenarios, outperforming traditional camera-based methods.

Conclusion: BasketLiDAR and the proposed MOT framework represent significant progress in sports player tracking, enabling more accurate and computationally efficient real-time analysis of basketball games.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

*Wutao Liu,YiDan Wang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-SEG, a training-free method for camouflaged object detection (COD) using retrieval-augmented generation and SAM-based segmentation, achieving competitive results on benchmark datasets with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the inefficiency and computational burden of existing COD methods and the reliance on high-quality prompts for better integration with foundation models like SAM.

Method: RAG-SEG splits the COD task into two phases: 1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that builds a retrieval database via unsupervised clustering to generate coarse masks as prompts, and 2) SAM-based segmentation (SEG) that refines these masks into accurate predictions.

Result: The proposed RAG-SEG achieves performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark COD datasets. All experiments are notably conducted on a personal laptop, underscoring the method's computational efficiency.

Conclusion: RAG-SEG is a novel, efficient, and training-free framework for COD that demonstrates competitive performance without requiring extensive computational resources or manual effort in creating prompts.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

*Naen Xu,Jinghuai Zhang,Changjiang Li,Zhi Chen,Chunyi Zhou,Qingming Li,Tianyu Du,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoEraser is a new framework designed to prevent text-to-video diffusion models from creating harmful, unauthorized, or undesirable content by modifying prompts and noise guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from concerns over text-to-video models being used to generate harmful, misleading, or unauthorized content, including privacy violations and copyright infringement.

Method: VideoEraser employs a training-free, plug-and-play approach using two stages: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG), ensuring models do not create undesirable concepts.

Result: The framework is experimentally validated across four tasksâobject erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasureâachieving a 46% average reduction of undesirable content compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: VideoEraser significantly improves the suppression of undesirable content in text-to-video models, offering a state-of-the-art solution that is effective, robust, and generalizable without requiring retraining.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the safety and effectiveness of autonomous vehicles by predicting pedestrian crossing intents from a distance.

Method: Deep learning models for pose prediction and three sequence modeling approaches (GRU, LSTM, and 1D CNN) were analyzed using video-based experimental setups.

Result: GRU outperformed LSTM in predictive accuracy, while 1D CNN demonstrated superior speed in predicting crossing intent.

Conclusion: The study presents an end-to-end framework integrating pose detection and sequence modeling to assist autonomous vehicles in predicting pedestrian behavior.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: This study analyzes Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) to understand their internal mechanisms, offering insights into their layer-wise operation and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing efforts in Video-LLMs concentrate on improving performance, leaving their internal mechanisms largely unexplored. This paper aims to fill that gap with a systematic empirical study.

Method: The study employs attention knockouts (Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, Language-to-Video Knockout) and applies them across different layers (global and fine-grained settings) to analyze information flow.

Result: It finds that video information extraction involves a two-stage process where early layers handle perceptual encoding and higher layers handle abstract reasoning. Intermediate layers in fine-grained settings significantly influence performance, while spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval.

Conclusion: The findings provide key insights into the inner workings of Video-LLMs, including ways to increase interpretability and reduce computational costs, marking a significant step toward understanding these models.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of computational costs and overfitting in traditional fine-tuning methods during transfer learning.

Method: BioTune employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify specific layers for fine-tuning, minimizing trainable parameters and tailoring model adjustments to achieve task-specific optimization.

Result: BioTune was tested on nine image classification datasets, showing improved or competitive accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods like AutoRGN and LoRA.

Conclusion: Selective layer fine-tuning using evolutionary algorithms can enhance transfer learning efficiency by balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer), enhancing compression efficiency and enabling updates for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based scenes. It reduces storage requirements significantly while preserving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing 3DGS compression methods: insufficient compression for large-scale or archival scenes and inability to accommodate scene changes after long-term storage.

Method: The method involves introducing ICGS-Quantizer, which optimizes compression by leveraging inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations. It uses shared codebooks across training scenes, applied universally to test scenes, and conditions scene decoding on images captured at decoding time.

Result: Experimental evaluations show that ICGS-Quantizer achieves superior compression efficiency, reducing storage to the kilobyte range while maintaining visual fidelity. Additionally, it adapts well to post-archival scene changes compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer effectively advances 3DGS compression and adaptability, making it practical for large-scale archival and dynamic updates. The proposed solution demonstrates robust performance and will be made publicly accessible.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DriveSplat, a method for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenarios, addressing issues in prior approaches through dynamic-static decoupling, voxel initialization, and deformable neural Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in 3D scene reconstruction for driving scenarios caused by motion blur, dynamic actors, and insufficient geometric optimization of static backgrounds.

Method: The proposed DriveSplat method employs dynamic-static decoupling, region-wise voxel initialization for improved detail representation, and deformable neural Gaussians. Additionally, depth and normal priors from pre-trained models enhance geometric accuracy.

Result: Evaluations on Waymo and KITTI datasets show that DriveSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Conclusion: DriveSplat significantly improves robustness and geometric accuracy in 3D scene reconstruction for driving environments, advancing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

*Ruizhuo Song,Beiming Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores improving deep learning modelsâ abstract reasoning ability through Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), identifying shortcomings in current methods and proposing three enhancement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with abstract reasoning tasks, and solving RPM problems is essential for enhancing machine intelligence in areas like pattern recognition and complex problem-solving.

Method: The paper analyzes RPM tasks through causal chain modeling and designs a baseline model, DIO, that maximizes the variational lower bound of mutual information between context and correct answers.

Result: Experiments show that DIO fails to achieve human-like reasoning logic due to the lower bound's inefficacy and mutual information's inability to capture causal relationships.

Conclusion: Limitations in DIO highlight the need for improved methodologies, with the paper proposing three progressive enhancement strategies to advance abstract reasoning in deep learning models.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network for video summarization, addressing challenges in temporal dependencies, semantic coherence, and noise in feature fusion. It outperforms existing methods across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of short video content has created a need for efficient video summarization techniques that can capture global temporal dependencies and maintain semantic coherence. Existing methods fail in these aspects and are prone to noise during multi-channel feature fusion.

Method: The SpiVG Network uses Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for autonomous keyframe extraction, a Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner for fine-grained contextual reasoning, and a Variational Inference Reconstruction Module employing ELBO to handle noise and uncertainty in multi-channel feature fusion.

Result: The experimental results show that SpiVG achieves superior performance compared to existing methods across datasets like SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS.

Conclusion: The SpiVG Network is a significant advancement in video summarization, enhancing information density, reducing computational complexity, and delivering improved results over state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed model and codes are publicly available for further research.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature

*Anthony Bisulco,Rahul Ramesh,Randall Balestriero,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how MAEs (Masked Autoencoders) learn spatial correlations in input images and provides insights into optimizing hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the connection between MAE hyperparameters and their performance on downstream tasks, an area that remains largely unexplored.

Method: Analytical derivations for linear MAEs and extended analysis for non-linear MAEs to evaluate how representations adapt to spatial correlations.

Result: The study shows that masking ratio and patch size play a crucial role in capturing spatial correlations and adapting representations beyond second-order statistics.

Conclusion: MAEs adapt to spatial correlations, and hyperparameter selection can be guided by analytical insights for better downstream performance optimization.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

### [133] [Bidirectional Temporal Information Propagation for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15415)
*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method, BIRD, for detecting small moving infrared targets in videos, utilizing both local and global temporal information for improved performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in moving infrared small target detection use sliding windows for temporal data aggregation but lack consideration of entire video optimization and global temporal information.

Method: The BIRD approach uses bidirectional temporal propagation, combining both local (via LTMF) and global (via GTMF) temporal motion fusion. Bidirectional features are further processed using a detection head, and the entire video is jointly optimized using additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion loss.

Result: Experiments show BIRD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: BIRD provides an improved framework for infrared small target detection, addressing the inefficiencies of sliding-window approaches and enhancing both temporal data usage and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

*Ahmet Can ÃmercikoÄlu,Mustafa Mansur YÃ¶nÃ¼gÃ¼l,Pakize ErdoÄmuÅ*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates the effect of input resolution on face detection models YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and MTCNN using the WIDER FACE dataset, finding YOLOv11 excelling in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand how input resolution impacts the effectiveness and robustness of deep learning-based face detectors in real-world scenarios.

Method: Evaluation of face detection at varying image resolutions using metrics like precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, and inference time.

Result: YOLOv11 emerges as the most accurate, YOLOv12 shows strong recall performance, and MTCNN excels in landmark localization but suffers in real-time processing.

Conclusion: YOLOv11 is the preferred choice for high-resolution applications, while YOLOv12 is suitable when recall is prioritized, and MTCNN works well for landmark localization under flexible time constraints.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a machine learning-based approach using YOLOv8 to detect microscopic dents in car exteriors, addressing shortcomings of traditional inspections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inefficiency and unreliability of manual car damage inspections, which often fail to detect tiny surface flaws.

Method: The paper utilizes YOLOv8 and its customized variants (YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42) trained with annotated datasets and real-time data augmentation to enhance detection robustness.

Result: The YOLOv8m-t42 model demonstrated superior performance with a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, making it more suitable for real-time applications.

Conclusion: The YOLOv8m-t42 model provides an accurate and efficient solution for detecting microscopic dents on car surfaces, proving its potential for practical use in automated inspections.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

*Yogesh Kumar,Uday Agarwal,Manish Gupta,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MATR, a transformer-based model for video-to-video moment retrieval, using semantic alignment and a novel pre-training technique to surpass state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of video-to-video moment retrieval, which requires semantic frame-level alignment and modeling of complex dependencies between two videos for accurate moment localization.

Method: The MATR model uses a transformer architecture with dual-stage sequence alignment to condition target video representations on query features. Additionally, a self-supervised pre-training approach is proposed for task-specific initialization.

Result: MATR achieved significant performance improvements, showing absolute gains of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU on the ActivityNet-VRL dataset and 14.7% in R@1 and 14.4% in mIoU on the SportsMoments dataset compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MATR demonstrates its effectiveness in advancing the task of video-to-video moment retrieval with strong performance improvements attributed to its innovative architecture and pre-training strategy.

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based novel view synthesis by addressing challenges in extremely sparse-view conditions without relying on Structure-from-Motion (SfM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to tackle the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods in scenarios where input views are extremely sparse and camera poses are uncertain, which hampers 3D reconstruction and rendering quality.

Method: They introduced an SfM-free 3DGS-based approach with a dense stereo module for initializing camera poses and reconstructing a global dense point cloud, alongside a coherent view interpolation module for generating consistent training views. Additionally, geometric regularization techniques were applied to refine rendering quality.

Result: The method achieved significantly improved performance in sparse-view settings, attaining a 2.75dB boost in PSNR and producing visually superior images with minimal distortion and high-frequency detail preservation.

Conclusion: This approach effectively overcomes the limitations of 3DGS under sparse-view input, providing an efficient and high-quality solution for novel view synthesis without requiring dense input or precise camera pose data.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: LGMSNet is a lightweight medical image segmentation framework overcoming existing models' limitations by addressing contextual perception and channel redundancy while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a lightweight and generalizable model for medical image segmentation, particularly for resource-limited clinical settings, addressing the inefficiencies and limitations of current lightweight models.

Method: The method involves a dual multiscale framework using heterogeneous intra-layer kernels for high-frequency information and sparse transformer-convolutional branches for low-frequency, global information extraction.

Result: LGMSNet demonstrated superior performance across six datasets, including strong zero-shot generalization on unseen datasets, proving its capability for real-world applications.

Conclusion: LGMSNet provides state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational requirements, making it highly suitable for medical segmentation in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction of human avatars, addressing limitations of single-view methods like ECON by leveraging multiple viewpoints for better pose and geometric accuracy.

Method: The proposed pipeline employs JMBO, a joint optimization algorithm that aligns a SMPL-X body model across all views, and integrates normal maps from front and back to capture fine surface details like clothing folds.

Result: MExECON enhances geometry and pose estimation compared to single-view ECON, achieving competitive results with modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MExECON effectively leverages multi-view inputs to enhance 3D human avatar reconstruction without requiring network retraining, improving detail fidelity.

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse is a novel framework for multimodal image fusion that addresses issues like modality misalignment and loss of high-frequency details. It introduces AdaWAT for frequency decoupling and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient cross-domain fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing multimodal image fusion methods such as misalignment and high-frequency detail loss, while enhancing image quality for practical applications like medical diagnostics and robotics.

Method: AdaSFFuse consists of two key innovations: Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for fusion across spatial and frequency domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on four MMIF tasks, including infrared-visible image fusion and medical image fusion, demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superiority in terms of robust performance with low computational cost.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse achieves better alignment and integration of multimodal features while preserving critical details, offering an efficient and compact solution for multimodal image fusion with task versatility.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExtraGS is a framework addressing challenges in synthesizing extrapolated driving scenes with improved geometric consistency and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating driving scenes for autonomous vehicles is vital but challenging due to geometric inconsistencies and rendering quality issues with existing methods.

Method: ExtraGS integrates geometric and generative priors using a novel RSG representation (Gaussian-SDF design) and FFGs for distant objects, combined with a self-supervised uncertainty estimation for selective integration.

Result: Experiments show ExtraGS improves realism, geometric consistency, and fidelity in extrapolated driving scene views across datasets and setups.

Conclusion: ExtraGS offers a robust solution for trajectory extrapolation that merges generative and geometric priors to enhance autonomous driving simulations.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sketch animation struggle with multi-object complexity and temporal consistency. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The method features a two-stage pipeline: Motion Initialization (dividing sketches into semantic groups, defining keyframes, and creating coarse animations) and Motion Refinement using the Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) for fine-tuning.

Result: GroupSketch shows significant improvements in generating high-quality and temporally consistent animations for multi-object sketches compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The model expands the potential applications of sketch animation by overcoming previous challenges related to object complexity and motion consistency.

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents D3FNet, a neural network designed to address challenges in extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery. It incorporates innovative modules to enhance fine-grained road structure segmentation and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the difficulty of extracting narrow roads from remote sensing imagery, which are challenging due to their width, fragmented topology, and occlusions.

Method: The proposed method, D3FNet, is built on an encoder-decoder backbone and introduces three innovations: a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module for enhancing road features, a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) for balancing spatial and semantic features, and a multi-scale dilation strategy to address continuity and gridding artifacts.

Result: The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in IoU and recall on benchmarks like DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG, especially in challenging road regions. Ablation studies additionally confirm the effectiveness of its design.

Conclusion: D3FNet demonstrates its capability as a robust solution for detecting fine-grained, narrow, and occluded roads in remote sensing imagery, showcasing improved performance through innovative architectural modules.

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADAPT, a gradient-free test-time adaptation approach that reframes the task as a Gaussian probabilistic inference problem to improve zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in test-time adaptation methods, such as reliance on backpropagation, lack of scalability, and inadequate modeling of class-conditional feature distributions.

Method: ADAPT uses Gaussian probabilistic inference by updating class means and a covariance matrix, supplemented with lightweight regularization informed by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank, avoiding gradient updates and requiring no source data.

Result: The method exhibits state-of-the-art performance over various benchmarks, handling diverse distribution shifts with improved scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: ADAPT demonstrates the feasibility of backpropagation-free TTA with reliable decision boundaries, offering a scalable, effective, and versatile solution for real-world distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Method: They propose a neighbor-aware soft mask that weights pixels with strong local variations in the initial training stage, followed by full-image training.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvement in reconstruction quality and compatibility with existing INR methods.

Conclusion: This novel approach introduces frequency-aware importance for pixel modeling, providing a new perspective in addressing the spectral bias issue in INRs.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

### [146] [Fast globally optimal Truncated Least Squares point cloud registration with fixed rotation axis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15613)
*Ivo Ivanov,Carsten Markgraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes faster methods for 3D point cloud registration using convex relaxation and contractor methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting 3D point cloud correspondences robustly with outlier rates up to 95% is essential but computationally challenging.

Method: The paper introduces a linear time convex relaxation algorithm and a contractor method to enhance Branch and Bound performance.

Result: The proposed method registers 100-point 3D point clouds in less than half a second under rotation-only scenarios, outperforming previous SDP-based approaches.

Conclusion: This solution ensures provable and empirical global optimality, but is currently limited to rotation-only scenarios without full 6DoF capabilities.

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

TL;DR: The study integrates camera traps and drone imagery processed with deep learning models to identify wildlife and human activity patterns in Chitwan National Park, revealing specific zones of human-wildlife conflict.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand spatial distributions of wildlife and human activities for identifying conflict zones and improving conservation planning.

Method: Used YOLOv11s and Faster RCNN deep learning models on camera trap and drone thermal imagery to analyze spatial patterns and overlap between wildlife and human activities.

Result: YOLOv11s achieved high performance (96.7% mAP50), and the study identified clear hotspots for wildlife and human activities, highlighting areas of potential human-wildlife conflict.

Conclusion: The integration of multiperspective monitoring with advanced object detection successfully identifies human-wildlife conflict zones, aiding wildlife surveillance and landscape management.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT is a Video LLM that overcomes coarse temporal reasoning in videos by introducing advanced mechanisms for temporal consistency and aligning language and visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs struggle with accurately capturing when events occur and how entities interact across time due to issues in timestamp encoding, temporal continuity, and alignment with relevant entities.

Method: The paper introduces three core innovations: 1) a Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder for better temporal consistency, 2) object-grounded representations to bind entities to their visual evidence, and 3) a mixed token scheme for explicit timestamp modeling for fine-grained temporal reasoning.

Result: Grounded VideoDiT achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like Charades STA, NExT GQA, and various VideoQA datasets, exhibiting strong grounding and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed designs significantly enhance temporal sensitivity, visual-linguistic alignment, and reasoning in videos, showcasing the robustness of Grounded VideoDiT in overcoming limitations of earlier Video LLMs.

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

*Swann Emilien CÃ©leste Destouches,Jesse Lahaye,Laurent Valentin Jospin,Jan Skaloud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a weakly supervised method to enhance tree instance segmentation in airborne laser scanning (ALS) data by iteratively using human-rated labels and a model for improvement, achieving a 34% performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality tree instance segmentation from ALS data is crucial for forest monitoring, but challenges exist due to data variation and the cost of precise labeling.

Method: The method involves utilizing an initial segmentation output rated by a human operator to train a rating model. This model classifies segmentation quality, and its feedback is used to finetune the segmentation model.

Result: The proposed method improves the accuracy of correctly identified tree instances by 34% while reducing non-tree predictions, though it underperforms in complex terrains with small trees or obstacles.

Conclusion: The weak supervision approach addresses challenges in expensive labeling, boosting tree segmentation accuracy significantly, though it has limitations in sparse and complex environments.

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

### [150] [Towards a 3D Transfer-based Black-box Attack via Critical Feature Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15650)
*Shuchao Pang,Zhenghan Chen,Shen Zhang,Liming Lu,Siyuan Liang,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CFG, a transfer-based black-box adversarial attack method for 3D point cloud models, improving attack transferability while maintaining imperceptibility, and achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of designing effective adversarial attacks on 3D point cloud models without relying on any target model-specific information, making attacks realistic under high-security scenarios.

Method: The proposed method, Critical Feature Guidance (CFG), enhances transferability by prioritizing the corruption of critical features shared across diverse model architectures and constrains the deviation of adversarial point clouds to ensure imperceptibility.

Result: CFG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CFG is a highly effective and transferable black-box attack method for 3D point cloud classification models, emphasizing the consistency of critical features among architectures while ensuring adversarial stealth.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapKD proposes a knowledge distillation framework to enhance efficient vision-centric models for online HD map construction in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of online HD map construction by avoiding reliance on stale offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites.

Method: MapKD introduces a Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS) framework utilizing a camera-LiDAR fusion model, a vision-centric coaching model, and a lightweight vision-based student model alongside specific distillation strategies (TGPD & MSRD).

Result: The MapKD approach improves the student model performance by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while enabling faster inference.

Conclusion: MapKD effectively transfers knowledge to vision-centric models for accurate and efficient online HD map construction, addressing limitations of prior methods and enhancing autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CM2LoD3, a new automated method for reconstructing detailed 3D building models (LoD3) using Conflict Maps and semantic segmentation, effectively automating LoD3 model creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for detailed 3D building models (LoD3) in urban planning, disaster management, and digital twins applications. Current methods rely heavily on manual input, making large-scale production difficult.

Method: The paper presents CM2LoD3, a method using Conflict Maps (CMs) derived from ray-to-model-prior analysis and Semantic Conflict Map Generators (SCMG). The approach involves semantic segmentation of real and synthetic Conflict Maps, enhanced by confidence-based fusion of textured model data.

Result: The CM2LoD3 method showcased segmentation and reconstruction of building openings with 61% performance using uncertainty-aware fusion techniques, demonstrating improved automation and accuracy in LoD3 model reconstruction.

Conclusion: The research establishes CM2LoD3 as a scalable, effective method for automating detailed 3D building model generation, which may facilitate broader adoption of LoD3 in urban and disaster management contexts.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

*Yongju Jia,Jiarui Ma,Xiangxian Li,Baiqiao Zhang,Xianhui Cao,Juan Liu,Yulong Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) to effectively fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in class-imbalanced scenarios, addressing inherent biases and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of bias and performance degradation in fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, especially in class-imbalanced settings, and to overcome shortcomings in prior approaches that enhance fine-tuning using large language models (LLMs) but fail to consider class imbalances in pre-training.

Method: A Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) framework is introduced, which builds a knowledge base covering five visual-semantic dimensions. It employs a dynamic routing mechanism during fine-tuning to align global visual classes, retrieve optimal prompts, and balance fine-grained semantics, stabilizing predictions through logits fusion.

Result: The MDPR framework achieves comparable results to current state-of-the-art methods on long-tailed benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, while incurring minimal computational overhead. Ablation studies highlight its effectiveness in addressing tail classes.

Conclusion: The MDPR framework provides a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance, effectively mitigating bias and improving performance in class-imbalanced scenarios.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents StreamMem, a mechanism for efficiently understanding long videos by compressing memory usage without needing to know questions in advance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and impracticality of current methods in handling long videos for visual-language reasoning, especially in multi-turn conversational or query-agnostic scenarios.

Method: Proposed a streaming-based mechanism, StreamMem, that encodes and compresses video frame data using attention scores with fixed-size memory, enabling efficient processing for long video contexts.

Result: StreamMem achieved state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression across various long video understanding and question answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: StreamMem offers an efficient and scalable solution for long video understanding and demonstrates competitiveness with query-aware methods, advancing the practical capabilities of multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

TL;DR: WorldWeaver introduces a framework aimed at enhancing temporal and structural consistency in long video generation by combining RGB and perceptual cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenges of structural and temporal inconsistencies caused by reliance on RGB signals in generative video modeling over long durations.

Method: WorldWeaver jointly models RGB and perceptual conditions, uses depth-based memory banks to enhance contextual quality, and applies segmented noise scheduling for efficient training.

Result: Experiments show improvements in reducing temporal drift and enhancing the fidelity of generated videos using WorldWeaver.

Conclusion: WorldWeaver addresses long video generation challenges with superior consistency and motion dynamics through its innovative framework.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the All-in-SAM Model, an enhanced computational pathology framework tackling limitations of general vision foundation models by leveraging molecular data and a three-step approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges faced by general vision foundation models, such as fine-grained semantic segmentation and the need for detailed annotations, and to improve accessibility in computational pathology.

Method: The authors propose the All-in-SAM Model, utilizing molecular-empowered learning, SAM adaptation for semantic focus, and refinement using Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL).

Result: The All-in-SAM Model demonstrated enhanced cell classification performance on both in-house and public datasets, even with variable annotation quality.

Conclusion: The approach reduces annotators' workload, enhances segmentation precision, and expands biomedical image analysis access in resource-limited contexts, thereby driving advancements in pathology automation and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Motivation: The paper aims to advance the field of video and image generation by introducing a unified model capable of synthesizing high-quality, high-resolution content efficiently.

Method: The authors propose a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture for better modality alignment and faster convergence. They implement rigorous data quality curation and use a manually annotated video quality model to filter data. Comprehensive training and inference recipes are also provided.

Result: Waver achieves superior performance in video synthesis with complex motion and ranks among the Top 3 in T2V and I2V leaderboards. It outperforms existing open-source models and rivals state-of-the-art commercial solutions.

Conclusion: This work significantly contributes to video generation technologies by providing a robust, top-performing model and practical insights for high-quality content creation. The authors aim to aid the community in advancing video generation research.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATLAS introduces a novel human body model that decouples outer mesh representation from internal skeleton features, outperforming existing models in accuracy and expressivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric human body models are limited by their reliance on linear bases and restrictive assumptions, which hinder their ability to capture detailed pose and shape variations.

Method: ATLAS is trained using 600,000 high-resolution scans and explicitly decouples shape from skeleton bases, grounding the mesh representation in the human skeleton for enhanced customization and independent fitting.

Result: ATLAS provides superior fitting accuracy for unseen poses and subjects, with better performance in complex pose representations compared to linear models.

Conclusion: The model achieves greater fidelity, customization of attributes, and independence in keypoint fitting, solving issues prevalent in prior approaches.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for generating high-quality 3D content from scene images for applications in VR/AR and embodied AI.

Method: Combines visual and geometric encoders, a novel feature aggregation module, and a position head to generate geometry, texture, and spatial positions of multiple 3D assets.

Result: SceneGen achieves efficient and robust generation performance, extensible to multi-image inputs, confirmed via quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: SceneGen provides a novel approach for high-quality 3D asset generation, offering potential advancements in practical downstream applications.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

*Qingyang Mao,Qi Cai,Yehao Li,Yingwei Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Ting Yao,Qi Liu,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAREdit, an autoregressive model for image editing that improves adherence to instructions and efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image editing suffer from global denoising, causing unintended modifications in the image and weak adherence to editing instructions. Autoregressive models, with their sequential approach, promise better adherence due to their causal and compositional nature.

Method: The proposed VAREdit framework leverages autoregressive modeling to achieve precise image edits by framing it as a next-scale prediction problem. It employs a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module to condition source image tokens effectively for multi-scale feature generation.

Result: VAREdit improves editing adherence by 30%+ in GPT-Balance compared to diffusion-based models and is 2.2Ã faster, completing a $512Ã512$ image edit in 1.2 seconds.

Conclusion: VAREdit surpasses current diffusion-based methods in both adherence to editing instructions and speed, offering a practical alternative for high-fidelity image editing tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

### [161] [Scaling Group Inference for Diverse and High-Quality Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15773)
*Gaurav Parmar,Or Patashnik,Daniil Ostashev,Kuan-Chieh Wang,Kfir Aberman,Srinivasa Narasimhan,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a scalable method to enhance the diversity and quality of groups of outputs in generative models, addressing redundancy in generating sets of results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of independent sampling in generative models, which often generates redundant samples and hampers idea exploration when presenting multiple results.

Method: The authors propose a scalable group inference method modeled as a quadratic integer assignment problem, optimizing quality and diversity of outputs using graph-based selection and progressive pruning for efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate notable enhancements in both diversity and quality of output groups across tasks such as text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation.

Conclusion: This framework successfully enables generative models to treat groups of outputs cohesively, improving both quality and diversity, proving its scalability and generalizability across tasks.

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

### [162] [CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15774)
*Haonan Qiu,Ning Yu,Ziqi Huang,Paul Debevec,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CineScale, a novel inference approach for generating high-resolution images and videos with pre-trained visual diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with generating high-resolution content due to limited training data and computational constraints, leading to repetitive patterns and low-quality outputs.

Method: The authors designed CineScale variants specifically tailored to overcome video generation issues for different architectural types, leveraging state-of-the-art frameworks with minimal or no fine-tuning.

Result: CineScale successfully generates 8k images without fine-tuning and 4k videos with minimal LoRA fine-tuning, showing significant improvements in high-resolution visual generation.

Conclusion: CineScale broadens visual generation capabilities to high-resolution outputs across both image and video formats, surpassing existing methods and effectively addressing previous challenges.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distributed systems struggle with performance, maintainability, and productivity, especially in machine learning applications at scale.

Method: Developed a modular pipeline architecture that integrates machine learning with Apache Spark using logical computation units named Pipes, moving away from microservice-based approaches.

Conclusion: The architecture balances system scalability, developer productivity, and maintainability effectively, offering insights for building high-performance distributed systems.

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at

high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative

billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we

establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Databelt, a state management framework for serverless workflows, optimizes state handling in dynamic environments like the 3D Compute Continuum, leading to significant reductions in latency and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serverless workflows face inefficiencies in dynamic environments due to high-latency state access and frequent network hops, especially in the 3D Compute Continuum (Edge-Cloud-Space). Addressing this issue enhances performance and reduces overhead.

Method: Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism ensuring proactive state movement to optimized nodes and a function state fusion mechanism to streamline state management for functions in shared runtimes.

Result: Databelt reduces workflow execution time by 66%, increases throughput by 50%, and decreases storage operations latency by up to 20% compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Databelt significantly improves serverless workflow efficiency in dynamic environments, demonstrating potential for optimizing state access and management in scenarios like the 3D Compute Continuum.

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

TL;DR: This paper introduces advanced mixed-precision inference techniques for LLMs, featuring optimized pipelines for hardware utilization, achieving better efficiency and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory and computational demands of LLMs by exploring mixed-precision formats across model components.

Method: It develops GEMM and attention pipelines for hierarchical hardware optimization and mixed-precision processing, with techniques like offline weight packing, instruction-level parallelism, and KV memory loading.

Result: Evaluations show reductions in latency (up to 61%) and increases in throughput (up to 156%) compared to existing frameworks across multiple LLMs and hardware configurations.

Conclusion: The approach consistently enhances performance, integrated into TurboMind for accessible high-performance inference solutions.

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a

*Caterina Feletti,Paola Flocchini,Debasish Pattanayak,Giuseppe Prencipe,Nicola Santoro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Dancing problem for robot swarms forming consecutive patterns, proposing a solution using the LUMI robot model with sequential scheduling, removing previous constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to solve the Dancing problem, where robot swarms form sequenced patterns, and overcome limitations related to choreography constraints and starting configurations in previous solutions.

Method: The authors use the LUMI robot model, which allows robots to emit lights from a finite palette, under a sequential scheduler and introduce a distributed counter-based algorithm.

Result: The proposed algorithm solves the problem for arbitrary periodic or finite sequences, subject to a bound dictated by the robots' available light colors and ensures spatial homogeneity even for non-rigid movements.

Conclusion: By utilizing the LUMI model's capabilities and a sequential scheduler, the universal Dancing problem becomes solvable without prior constraints, ensuring homogeneous choreography through a novel distributed algorithm.

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

*Pierre Fraigniaud,Minh Hang Nguyen,Ami Paz,Ulrich Schmid,Hugo Rincon Galeana*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper establishes a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous and directed message-passing systems with up to t crashes, generalizing existing bounds for various network types and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to generalize existing lower bounds for consensus problems, particularly k-set agreement, across diverse network types and conditions, including crashes, using topological and algorithmic advancements.

Method: The authors employ a sequence of shellable carrier maps to track protocol evolution and use a novel approach grounded in connectivity and Sperner's lemma to extend the lower bounds. They also simplify the input complex via Kuhn triangulations.

Result: They derive a generalized lower bound for k-set agreement across arbitrary communication networks with initial crashes, defined using communication graph metrics, and show a reduction in the complexity of input structures.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified and simplified framework for analyzing lower bounds in synchronous systems, offering broader applicability and deeper insights into k-set agreement in diverse network scenarios.

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CausalMesh enhances serverless workflows with causally consistent caching despite function migration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers encounter anomalies due to inconsistent caching in serverless workflows with function migration.

Method: Introduced CausalMesh for coordination-free and abort-free caching protocols, formally verified via Dafny.

Result: CausalMesh outperforms existing solutions with lower latency and higher throughput.

Conclusion: CausalMesh improves reliability and performance in stateful serverless workflows with mobile computations.

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Motivation: The motivation behind the research is to address the challenge of integrating ethical reasoning into the decision-making of autonomous vehicles to ensure safer adoption and reduce traffic fatalities.

Method: The paper presents a hierarchical Safe RL framework, which employs a composite ethical risk cost function to decide high-level motion targets and utilizes a dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay. Polynomial path planning and controllers ensure accurate and smooth trajectory execution.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving quality compared to baseline methods when tested on real-world traffic scenarios with diverse road users.

Conclusion: This study is a first-of-its-kind exploration of ethical decision-making using Safe RL for autonomous vehicles in real-world settings, showcasing the potential of blending formal control theory with data-driven learning in human-mixed traffic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a personalized lung cancer risk prediction agent employing cohort-specific data retrieval and reasoning for optimal model selection to enhance prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of accurate lung cancer risk prediction due to variability across patient populations and clinical settings, where no single model performs uniformly well.

Method: The method involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search across patient data, and (2) leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning to select the best suitable among eight predictive models.

Result: The agent dynamically selects the most relevant prediction model tailored to individual patient profiles by combining cohort-specific data and advanced reasoning techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers an effective path toward individualized and cohort-aware lung cancer risk assessment, addressing variability issues in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

*Jiacheng Hu,Bo Zhang,Ting Xu,Haifeng Yang,Min Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining graph neural networks and Transformers for more accurate Parkinson's disease progression prediction, achieving improved outcomes over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address two challenges in Parkinson's disease progression prediction: the complexity of symptom evolution and insufficient modeling of temporal dependencies between clinical symptoms.

Method: The framework integrates structural perception via graph neural networks, which model clinical symptom relationships. It also uses a Transformer architecture for dynamic temporal feature modeling, along with a structure-aware gating mechanism for fusion of structural and temporal information.

Result: The proposed model outperformed mainstream prediction methods on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data, with improvements in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1 metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers enhanced prediction accuracy, generalization, and scalability, aiding intelligent modeling of Parkinson's disease and similar chronic conditions.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

*Anurag Tripathi,Ajeet Kumar Singh,Rajsabi Surya,Aum Gupta,Sahiinii Lemaina Veikho,Dorien Herremans,Sudhir Bisane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HHNAS-AM, a novel hierarchical neural architecture search method using adaptive mutation policies, improving test accuracy on tasks like Spider by 8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in current NAS models for text classification, such as a lack of organized hierarchical structures and an overly large, redundant search space.

Method: The paper introduces HHNAS-AM, which uses domain-specific architectural templates and Q-learning-based adaptive mutation strategies to navigate the search space more effectively.

Result: The proposed model shows consistent high performance, achieving an 8% improvement in test accuracy on the Spider dataset compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully organizes and effectively explores the search space for NAS in text classification, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

### [175] [Linear Preference Optimization: Decoupled Gradient Control via Absolute Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14947)
*Rui Wang,Qianguo Sun,Chao Song,Junlong Wu,Tianrong Chen,Zhiyun Zeng,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel framework designed to address challenges in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). LPO improves stability, mitigates overfitting and collapse, and enhances performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO, despite its popularity for preference optimization due to its simplicity and stability, suffers from issues like overfitting and collapse. This paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors propose LPO, which features gradient decoupling using absolute difference loss, stability enhancement via offset constraints and positive regularization, and controllable rejection suppression through gradient separation with tunable coefficients.

Result: Experiments show LPO enhances performance consistently across tasks such as general text processing, math challenges, and text-to-speech tasks.

Conclusion: LPO is a robust and adjustable framework for alignment, offering improvements over DPO. The study shares source code, models, and training data publicly to support further research.

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LFM4Ads, a framework for improving ad recommendation using multi-granularity transfer of user, item, and cross-representations from pre-trained large-scale foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in ad recommendation only use user representations (URs) and fail to account for item representations (IRs) and user-item cross interactions (CRs). Additionally, current methods lack granular transfer mechanisms between upstream and downstream scenarios.

Method: The study proposes LFM4Ads, which systematically transfers user, item, and cross-representations. It uses mechanisms like non-linear adapters for feature transfer, an interaction module for module-level transfer, and standalone retrieval for model-level transfer.

Result: LFM4Ads was deployed in Tencentâs large-scale advertising platform and processed tens of billions of samples daily. It led to 10+ production launches, achieving a 2.45% GMV uplift, with significant annual revenue gains.

Conclusion: LFM4Ads bridges major gaps in ad recommendation processes by transferring all possible representations at various granularities, yielding measurable improvements in industrial-scale advertising performance.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

### [177] [TOAST: Fast and scalable auto-partitioning based on principled static analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15010)
*Sami Alabed,Dominik Grewe,Norman Alexander Rink,Timur Sitdikov,Agnieszka Swietlik,Dimitrios Vytiniotis,Daniel Belov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses model partitioning challenges in distributed systems with a novel approach combining static compiler analysis and Monte Carlo Tree Search to enhance efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-partitioners struggle with memory constraints and inefficiencies due to the exponentially large and ambiguous space of possible partitionings.

Method: The authors introduce a static compiler analysis to define efficient decision spaces and use Monte Carlo Tree Search to resolve tensor sharding conflicts.

Result: Their system outperforms current industry methods across various hardware and models by discovering better solutions automatically.

Conclusion: The approach automates and optimizes model partitioning, providing a robust solution for handling large and complex machine learning models.

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

### [178] [CuMoLoS-MAE: A Masked Autoencoder for Remote Sensing Data Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14957)
*Anurup Naskar,Nathanael Zhixin Wong,Sara Shamekh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents CuMoLoS-MAE, a novel machine learning framework for restoring and analyzing atmospheric data with high fidelity and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing are often degraded by low SNR, range folding, and discontinuities, and traditional methods and existing deep learning models have limitations in restoring finer structures and estimating uncertainty.

Method: CuMoLoS-MAE uses a curriculum-guided approach during training, progressively increasing mask ratios to reconstruct from sparse data. The Monte Carlo ensemble during inference aggregates outputs from multiple masking iterations to restore atmospheric data and provide pixel-level uncertainty maps.

Result: CuMoLoS-MAE accurately reconstructs fine-scale atmospheric features such as updraft cores and vortices, while also quantifying uncertainties. Its predictions outperform traditional methods, supporting real-time and analytical applications.

Conclusion: CuMoLoS-MAE provides a new standard for atmospheric data processing by combining data restoration, uncertainty quantification, and application readiness, thereby benefiting fields like convection diagnostics and climate reanalysis.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

### [179] [Twin-Boot: Uncertainty-Aware Optimization via Online Two-Sample Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15019)
*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), incorporating uncertainty estimation into the optimization of deep learning systems to address challenges in overparameterized and low-data environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard gradient descent methods lack confidence measures, which pose problems in overparameterized and low-data regimes due to overfitting risks.

Method: Twin-Boot trains two identical models on independent bootstrap samples with periodic mean-reset to maintain trajectories in the same basin, leveraging divergence for uncertainty estimation and adaptive weight sampling for regularization.

Result: The approach improves calibration, generalization, and generates interpretable uncertainty maps in deep learning and high-dimensional inverse problems.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty estimation into optimization enhances model robustness, providing solutions better suited for overparameterized, low-data challenges in complex systems.

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

*Saar Tzour-Shaday,Dana Drachsler Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces BaVerLy, a new method for efficiently verifying neural network robustness by jointly verifying similar input regions (Îµ-balls), reducing overall computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network classifiers in safety-critical contexts are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing local robustness verifiers are either slow or imprecise, limiting their scalability and effectiveness.

Method: BaVerLy dynamically groups Îµ-balls with similar network computation into mini-batches for joint verification. It adaptively refines batches to boost efficiency and reuses analysis results to expedite subsequent verifications.

Result: BaVerLy improved verification time by an average of 2.3x and up to 4.1x compared to single Îµ-ball analysis, significantly reducing analysis time from 24 hours to 6 hours.

Conclusion: BaVerLy successfully enhances local robustness verification, demonstrating scalability and practicality for analyzing adversarial robustness in neural networks.

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the weaknesses of traditional CAPTCHA systems that are increasingly bypassed by AI tools like OCR and adversarial image processing.

Method: Combines GANs for dynamic image challenges, RL for adaptive tuning of difficulty, and LLMs for generating text and audio prompts, alongside evaluation metrics based on real-world traffic performance.

Result: Achieved a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate during evaluations, showing significant improvement over existing systems.

Conclusion: Aura-CAPTCHA offers a robust and scalable solution for securing online platforms, reducing bypass rates, and improving accessibility compared to conventional CAPTCHA systems.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive
difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio
prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three
correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words
into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible
to users, addressing gaps highlighted in previous research.

### [182] [Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051)
*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses robust estimation under varying corruption rates across samples, deriving tight minimax rates and shedding light on optimal estimator behavior for different settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust estimation methods assume uniform corruption rates, but in real-world applications like federated learning, samples often have heterogenous corruption rates.

Method: The authors derive tight minimax rates for multivariate bounded and Gaussian distributions under varying corruption patterns, and analyze linear regression performance.

Result: The study defines optimal discard thresholds for corrupted samples based on corruption rate distributions and approaches minimax rates, achieving accurate error bounds in high dimensional settings.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous corruption can be addressed more effectively by considering empirical corruption rate distributions, enabling robust estimators to discard unnecessary samples for improved performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies generative equilibrium operators (GEOs), a specific type of neural operators, offering both theoretical and practical improvements in solving infinite-dimensional convex optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between theoretical worst-case bounds requiring unrealistic parameter counts for neural operators and experimental evidence suggesting their practicality.

Method: The paper introduces GEOs that use finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers to approximate solutions to families of convex optimization problems over separable Hilbert spaces, demonstrating favorable parameter scaling.

Result: GEOs achieve uniform approximation of solutions with parameters growing logarithmically in the reciprocal of the approximation error, and their effectiveness is validated in applications like nonlinear PDEs, stochastic optimal control, and financial hedging under constraints.

Conclusion: Generative equilibrium operators bridge the theory-practice gap for neural operators, providing scalable and effective methods for solving infinite-dimensional problems and showcasing broad applicability.

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel momentum-based optimizer (NGN-M) that improves stability and performance across hyperparameter choices, specifically step-size, matching or surpassing existing optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the challenges posed by the sensitivity of modern optimizers to hyperparameter tuning, particularly step-size, which is resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: The proposed NGN-M optimizer integrates momentum-based mechanics with the NGN step-size adaptation method, achieving $
\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ convergence under fewer restrictive assumptions.

Result: The NGN-M optimizer shows enhanced stability to step-size hyperparameters and delivers performance on par with or better than state-of-the-art methods, supported by empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: NGN-M offers a robust and efficient alternative to existing optimizers, reducing dependency on meticulous hyperparameter tuning while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra is a proposed design for hybrid long-context language models that leverage a combination of advanced computational techniques within a 1.6B parameter limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for modular, input-adaptive long-context language models that can efficiently handle large-scale computations while supporting diverse applications.

Method: Hydra integrates a Structured State Space Model backbone with sparse global attention, chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual memory systems, while providing clear parameter complexity tracking and a stable curriculum approach.

Result: Toy-scale prototype measurements were performed to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative scaling behaviors like expert routing and long-context throughput, but performance validation at full scale remains pending.

Conclusion: Hydra acts as a foundational blueprint to encourage further empirical studies rather than a finalized system, aiming to pave the way for robust long-context language models.

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

*Sebastian MusiaÅ,Bartosz ZieliÅski,Tomasz Danel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEAL is an interpretable graph neural network that provides intuitive and trustworthy explanations for molecular property predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks excel at molecular property predictions but lack interpretability, limiting their trustworthiness in critical domains like drug discovery.

Method: SEAL breaks molecular graphs into chemically relevant subgraphs and quantifies their causal influence on predictions, while explicitly reducing inter-fragment message passing to improve explainability.

Result: SEAL outperforms existing explainability techniques in attribution metrics, human-aligned interpretability, and is validated through extensive evaluations and user studies.

Conclusion: SEAL bridges the gap between prediction performance and interpretability, enabling more transparent molecular modeling for impactful applications.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

TL;DR: The paper studies federated learning for nonlinear systems, proving quicker convergence with more clients compared to centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve system identification of nonlinear dynamics through federated learning and compare its efficiency against centralized methods.

Method: Theoretical analysis guarantees better performance with federated approaches and experiments validate results under controlled settings with nonlinear systems.

Result: Federated learning consistently aided individual client convergence with increasing participants, validated on pendulum and quadrotor data.

Conclusion: Federated methods are promising for nonlinear system identification, showing better convergence rates with a careful selection of feature maps and number of clients.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

*Chence Yang,Ci Zhang,Lei Lu,Qitao Tan,Sheng Li,Ao Li,Xulong Tang,Shaoyi Huang,Jinzhen Wang,Guoming Li,Jundong Li,Xiaoming Zhai,Jin Lu,Geng Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the growing computational cost of deep neural network training by improving layer-freezing techniques and proposing strategies to mitigate storage and augmentation issues in caching feature maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of neural networks and datasets has raised computational costs for training, and current layer-freezing methods are inefficient, particularly in addressing challenges like storage overhead and data augmentation for frozen layers.

Method: The paper introduces 'similarity-aware channel augmentation' to improve accuracy, and a 'progressive compression' strategy to reduce storage overhead, incorporating lossy data compression while maintaining model performance.

Result: The proposed techniques significantly reduce training costs with only minor time overhead and preserve model accuracy. A comprehensive evaluation of freezing and compression strategies is also conducted.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic solution to address challenges in caching-based layer freezing, offering practical insights and methods for optimizing efficient DNN training while addressing computational constraints.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

*Elif Konyar,Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework using low-rank tensor decomposition to model heterogeneous subpopulations more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of modeling diverse subpopulations, considering their variations in characteristics and behaviors.

Method: By combining multi-task learning and low-rank tensor decomposition, the framework captures shared structures and subpopulation-specific differences to enable efficient learning.

Result: Experiments on simulation and case study datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and interpretability versus benchmarks, especially for variable subpopulations.

Conclusion: The framework enhances model personalization, accuracy, and interpretability in heterogeneous settings by leveraging shared structures and unique subpopulation traits.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

### [190] [Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697)
*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) for sampling in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and proposes a hybrid sampling approach. While no improvement in RBM training was achieved, QA shows promise for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore why D-Wave quantum annealer hasn't shown significant improvement in RBM training and to investigate if its unique sampling abilities can benefit other machine learning applications, such as addressing catastrophic forgetting.

Method: A hybrid sampling method combining classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and D-Wave QA contributions was tested, alongside leveraging QA capabilities to generate diverse samples for catastrophic forgetting mitigation.

Result: No improvement was achieved in RBM training using the QA hybrid sampling approach. However, QA's sample variety showed promise in mitigating catastrophic forgetting with comparable efficiency to classical methods.

Conclusion: While D-Wave QA does not aid RBM training, it holds potential for other applications in machine learning, specifically for catastrophic forgetting mitigation, due to its ability to generate diverse lower-probability samples.

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how deep neural networks (DNNs) classify random inputs through "fooling examples," revealing feature space collapse and degeneracy in overparameterized regimes and offering a novel "wormhole" solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to understand DNN generalization, especially their behavior in confidently classifying random-looking inputs, which poses challenges to reliability and interpretability.

Method: The paper uses an analytical framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, avoiding conventional approaches like gradient-based optimization and explicit labeling.

Result: DNNs exhibit a feature space collapse that aids generalization but also degeneracy as layers increase, learning trivial solutions. The authors propose a "wormhole" solution to address this issue.

Conclusion: The wormhole solution reconciles random and meaningful labels, offering new insights into shortcut learning and potential advancements in unsupervised learning dynamics.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

### [192] [Evaluating Sparse Autoencoders for Monosemantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15094)
*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a solution for reducing polysemanticity in large language models and introduces new metrics and methods for assessing their interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of polysemantic neurons in large language models that limit interpretability, by examining how sparse autoencoders improve monosemanticity and concept separability.

Method: The authors use a fine-grained concept separability score based on Jensen-Shannon distance to quantitatively evaluate monosemanticity in large language models, applying this metric across various SAE variants and benchmarks. They also propose a new intervention method, Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP).

Result: The study finds that SAEs reduce polysemanticity and improve concept separability, although higher sparsity does not always enhance separability and may harm downstream performance. The APP method achieves superior concept-level suppression compared to existing strategies.

Conclusion: While sparse autoencoders improve interpretability through reduced polysemanticity and enhanced concept control, optimal sparsity levels need to balance separability and performance. The proposed APP intervention method offers a promising tool for managing targeted concept activation in large language models.

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

*Shaswati Saha,Sourajit Saha,Manas Gaur,Tejas Gokhale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the shortcomings of Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs) in text-to-image models, finding that these techniques can be bypassed and have significant side effects. The authors also introduce a benchmark, "Side Effect Evaluation," to assess CET robustness comprehensively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing concerns about the misuse of text-to-image generative models for violating privacy, copyright, or safety drive the need for effective methods to prohibit the generation of specified undesired concepts.

Method: The authors analyzed CETs and developed an evaluation benchmark named "Side Effect Evaluation" with hierarchical and compositional prompts to measure side effects such as neighboring concept impact, target concept evasion, and attribute leakage. They conducted experiments using a dataset and automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: The study finds that CETs can be circumvented using semantic variations and hierarchical relationships. The techniques also display side effects like attribute leakage, attention concentration or dispersal, and impaired synthesis of related concepts.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that current CETs are vulnerable to circumvention and have substantial side effects, emphasizing the need for more robust solutions. The authors also provide resources to support future research.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for source-free unlearning in machine learning that removes specific data from a trained model without needing access to the original training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of data privacy and the necessity of complying with regulations drive the need for techniques to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from machine learning models, particularly in scenarios where the original dataset is inaccessible.

Method: The researchers developed a method to estimate the Hessian matrix of unknown remaining training data, enabling efficient zero-shot unlearning with theoretical performance guarantees.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method performs effectively across diverse datasets, successfully unlearning specific data while preserving the model's accuracy on remaining data.

Conclusion: The presented method is robust, theoretically sound, and addresses the source-free unlearning scenario, offering a practical solution for data privacy concerns in machine learning models.

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Universal Reinforcement Learning (URL), extending classical RL using categorial and coalgebraic frameworks for asynchronous distributed computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize reinforcement learning (RL) using advanced mathematical frameworks like universal coalgebras and categorial constructs, facilitating better modeling of asynchronous distributed systems.

Method: The approach involves categorifying RL concepts like MDPs and PSRs as functor categories and extending their modeling through universal coalgebras, leveraging topos theory and dynamic system models.

Result: The paper models the space of RL algorithms using category theory, offering a generalized view of fixed-point problems. It identifies URL systems capable of distributed asynchronous value function computation using universal coalgebras.

Conclusion: URL broadens the RL framework by unifying various dynamic system models and asynchronous computation methods under a comprehensive, mathematically rigorous abstraction.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consensus on the effectiveness of SoTA DPML techniques due to discrepancies in experimental conditions, and to evaluate their reproducibility and replicability.

Method: The authors conducted reproducibility and replicability experiments on 11 recent SoTA DPML techniques, analyzing their performance outside their original experimental settings.

Result: Some methods proved robust, while others failed to perform consistently under different experimental conditions.

Conclusion: The paper identifies challenges specific to DPML reproducibility, proposes solutions for these challenges, and offers best practices for producing reliable and valid research in this domain.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

*Xiangman Li,Xiaodong Wu,Qi Li,Jianbing Ni,Rongxing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeLLM, a defense framework aimed at reducing harmful outputs from LLMs via an unlearning-based approach that suppresses unsafe behaviors without degrading model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the dangers posed by jailbreak attacks, which exploit adversarial prompts to bypass safety mechanisms in LLMs and cause them to generate harmful or biased content.

Method: The paper proposes a three-stage unlearning framework: (1) detecting unsafe outputs via hybrid evaluations, (2) localizing harmful knowledge through FFN activations, and (3) using constrained optimization to eliminate unsafe behavior while preserving overall performance.

Result: SafeLLM demonstrates substantial reductions in attack success rates on various benchmarks for Vicuna, LLaMA, and GPT-J, while retaining the linguistic fluency and general-purpose capabilities of the models.

Conclusion: Unlearning harmful knowledge is a promising method for enhancing LLM safety, offering stronger guarantees against harmful behaviors and robust defenses compared to traditional safety techniques.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

TL;DR: FairPrep is a benchmarking framework to evaluate fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in algorithmic outcomes is a major concern, especially in high-stakes decision-making. Pre-processing methods, despite their advantages, lack standardized tools for evaluation.

Method: FairPrep is built on AIF360, supporting the integration of datasets, fairness interventions, and models, with batch-processing for automated fairness and utility metrics reporting.

Result: FairPrep establishes a framework for reproducible evaluations and standardized pipelines for fairness-aware pre-processing methods.

Conclusion: The framework addresses the gap in pre-processing fairness evaluations, paving the way for better data-level fairness research.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

TL;DR: Proposing a frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm to improve tensor neural networks for solving high-dimensional multi-scale problems, addressing their limitations in capturing high-frequency features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TNNs are powerful for high-dimensional problems but face difficulties in accurately representing high-frequency features due to the Frequency Principle, necessitating enhanced expressivity.

Method: The paper employs Fourier analysis to study TNNs' dynamics, introduces random Fourier features, performs Discrete Fourier Transform on component functions using tensor structure, and creates a frequency-adaptive algorithm.

Result: The frequency-adaptive TNNs algorithm significantly enhances expressivity and robustness in solving multi-scale, high-dimensional problems, validated through extensive numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency adaptiveness via Fourier transform techniques improves TNNs' performance in complex high-dimensional scenarios, overcoming conventional limitations.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

TL;DR: The study introduces SleepDIFFormer, a Multivariate Differential Transformer, to improve automated EEG-EOG-based sleep stage classification, achieving state-of-the-art results across five datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in sleep stage classification posed by manual inspection and poor generalization of current machine learning models on EEG and EOG signals.

Method: The SleepDIFFormer uses a Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) to process EEG and EOG signals, focusing on domain-invariant joint representation learning through cross-domain alignment.

Result: Evaluation on five datasets demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, along with ablation studies highlighting attention weight relevance to sleep patterns.

Conclusion: The method advances automated sleep staging by mitigating variability challenges, offering a robust solution for sleep quality assessment.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Attribution Learning (MAL) for CVR prediction, integrating multiple attribution perspectives to enhance predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVR prediction models rely on a single attribution mechanism, ignoring complementary signals from other perspectives, leading to suboptimal predictions.

Method: The proposed MAL framework integrates signals from multiple attribution mechanisms using an Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and Primary Target Predictor (PTP), supported by a novel CAT training strategy for enhanced supervision.

Result: Empirical evaluations show +0.51% GAUC improvement in offline metrics and a +2.6% increase in ROI during online experiments.

Conclusion: MAL demonstrates significant advantages over traditional single-attribution models, offering better performance and compatibility with industrial environments.

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

### [203] [Locally Pareto-Optimal Interpretations for Black-Box Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15220)
*Aniruddha Joshi,Supratik Chakraborty,S Akshay,Shetal Shah,Hazem Torfah,Sanjit Seshia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to create scalable and meaningful explanations for black-box machine learning models using local Pareto-optimality guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing interpretation synthesis methods, such as lack of formal Pareto-optimal guarantees and poor scalability.

Method: The authors use a multi-objective technique like Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate candidates, followed by local optimality verification using SAT solvers.

Result: The framework produces interpretations that are scalable and closely align with globally optimal methods.

Conclusion: This approach enables a balance of scalability and formal guarantees, providing trustworthy interpretations of machine learning models via locally optimal Pareto solutions.

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

### [204] [Learning ECG Representations via Poly-Window Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15225)
*Yi Yuan,Joseph Van Duyn,Runze Yan,Zhuoyi Huang,Sulaiman Vesal,Sergey Plis,Xiao Hu,Gloria Hyunjung Kwak,Ran Xiao,Alex Fedorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a poly-window contrastive learning framework to improve ECG analysis by learning temporally invariant features, outperforming conventional two-view methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in deep learning for ECG analysis due to scarce annotated data and improve upon existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods that do not fully utilize the temporal structure in ECG signals.

Method: Developed a poly-window contrastive learning framework that extracts multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to create positive pairs and uses slow feature analysis for learning invariant and meaningful features.

Result: Poly-window contrastive learning showed superior performance in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher AUROC and F1 scores while significantly reducing pre-training epochs and total computation time.

Conclusion: This framework is an efficient and scalable approach for ECG analysis and offers a generalizable self-supervised learning method for biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time reasoning approaches like majority voting often show diminishing accuracy and high computational costs, which motivates the need for more efficient methods.

Method: DeepConf dynamically filters low-quality reasoning traces using model-internal confidence signals without needing additional training or hyperparameter adjustments.

Result: On rigorous benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves impressive accuracy of up to 99.9% while reducing token generation by up to 84.7%.

Conclusion: DeepConf is a simple and effective solution for enhancing reasoning tasks in LLMs, offering better performance and efficiency without extra tuning or training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full
parallel thinking.

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effectiveness of the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric in understanding knowledge graph (KG) complexity and evaluating link prediction performance, finding it inconsistent and proposing alternative metrics as better indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to evaluate the reliability of the CSG metric for measuring dataset complexity in knowledge graph settings, as well as its correlation with model performance. This is motivated by the need for robust metrics to benchmark link prediction tasks accurately.

Method: The authors critically examine CSG in the context of multi-relational link prediction using transformer-derived embeddings. They also introduce and test new structural and semantic KG complexity metrics like Relation Entropy and graph centrality measures.

Result: The findings show that CSG is sensitive to parameterization, fails to scale with class numbers, and correlates weakly with performance metrics. In contrast, proposed measures like Relation Entropy and node-level Maximum Relation Diversity exhibit strong correlations with task difficulty metrics like MRR and Hit@1.

Conclusion: CSG's claimed robustness and generalizability are not suitable for link prediction problems in KGs. Alternative measures like Relation Entropy provide better indicators of task difficulty, emphasizing the need for more reliable and task-specific dataset complexity metrics.

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

*Zhaorui Tan,Yijie Hu,Xi Yang,Qiufeng Wang,Anh Nguyen,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PL-Reg, a partial-logic regularization approach that improves adaptability to unknown classes and enhances generalization, validated with experiments on visual classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in visual classification tasks involving unknown classes, including limitations of existing approaches like class discovery and incremental learning paradigms.

Method: A novel partial-logic regularization term (PL-Reg) is introduced, supported by a formal demonstration of partial logic's effectiveness and experiments in various classification scenarios.

Result: The method improves generalization and adaptability, validated through experiments on tasks such as Generalized Category Discovery and Class Incremental Learning.

Conclusion: Partial logic enables better handling of unknown classes and delivers consistent performance improvements in visual classification tasks.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ExBigBang, a hybrid model combining textual and tabular data for enhanced explainability in persona classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing complexity of user interactions, the paper aims to improve persona classification by contextualizing user behavior using both textual and tabular data while ensuring explainability of model predictions.

Method: The approach involves a hybrid text-tabular model leveraging transformer-based architectures, enriched with metadata and domain knowledge, in a dynamic user profiling and classification framework.

Result: Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model, with an ablation study showing the advantages of combining textual and tabular data.

Conclusion: ExBigBang effectively addresses challenges in persona classification by improving contextual understanding and model explainability, offering potential for better user-centric designs.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how end-users can collectively act to relabel data to enhance fairness in machine learning models without firm-side involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the issue of biases in machine learning models that lead to unfair treatment of minority groups, and the challenges associated with existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques.

Method: The authors propose three model-agnostic, practical methods for strategic data relabeling by minority groups and test their effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Result: The findings indicate that a subgroup of the minority group can meaningfully mitigate unfairness with minimal impact on overall prediction error.

Conclusion: End-user collective action presents a viable and effective alternative for improving fairness in machine learning models without requiring changes in the firm's processes.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoFormer is a proposed model designed to address biases and shortcomings in dynamic graph-level embedding, achieving state-of-the-art results in related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic graph-level embeddings, crucial for real-world scenarios, struggle with Structural Visit Bias and Abrupt Evolution Blindness, affecting their representational quality and adaptability to structural and temporal changes.

Method: EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module for better node differentiation and an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal Module involving timestamp classification, temporal segmentation, and self-attention to handle structural and temporal challenges.

Result: EvoFormer outperforms existing methods on five benchmark datasets, excelling in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal segmentation.

Conclusion: By addressing critical structural and temporal biases, EvoFormer advances the effectiveness of dynamic graph representation and can adapt well to evolving graph structures.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CITE, the first and largest benchmark dataset for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs in the field of catalytic materials, addressing the lack of large-scale datasets in this domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets for studying and comparing representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs, which include multiple node types and edge relations.

Method: The authors created the CITE dataset spanning 438K nodes and 1.2M edges across four relation types. They set up standardized evaluation protocols for node classification and conducted extensive benchmarking and ablation studies across different learning paradigms.

Result: The paper categorized and compared four types of learning paradigms on the dataset: homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM models, and LLM+Graph models, alongside conducting ablation experiments highlighting the dataset's heterogeneous and textual features.

Conclusion: By introducing the CITE dataset and evaluation framework, the study facilitates fair comparisons and advances research in representation learning for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address limitations in traditional clustering methods, such as the need for preselecting the number of clusters, and leverages Federated Learning for decentralized data processing.

Method: An Evolving Fuzzy System was implemented in PyTorch, supporting dynamic cluster adaptation without prior count selection, and used within a Federated Learning framework where only model parameters, not data, are shared.

Result: The method outperformed standard classification approaches on several UCI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness despite computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed Evolving Fuzzy System in Federated Learning presents a promising solution for decentralized data processing while maintaining high accuracy in classification and clustering tasks.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid least squares/gradient descent strategy to expedite DeepONet training, breaking a large linear system into smaller separate problems for efficient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepONet training can be computationally expensive due to the complexity of optimizing all parameters, especially with the large linear system involving branch and trunk network inputs.

Method: The proposed method combines least squares optimization for the last layer (branch network) and gradient descent for the hidden layer parameters while decomposing the large LS system into manageable subproblems for efficient solving.

Result: The proposed approach leads to a more efficient training process for DeepONet, reducing computational overhead while retaining performance, and it is applicable to $L^2$ loss with a regularization term.

Conclusion: This hybrid method simplifies DeepONet training while maintaining flexibility for broader loss types, improving efficiency in supervised and physics-informed unsupervised learning.

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid human activity recognition (HAR) framework that combines user generalization with on-device few-shot learning-based personalization to address user-induced concept drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human Activity Recognition models suffer from degraded performance when applied to new users due to user-induced concept drift. This paper seeks to address this challenge through efficient personalization.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid framework that generalizes across users and adapts to individual users using on-device few-shot learning. They focus on updating only the classifier layer for fast personalization with minimal computational impact.

Result: The framework was tested on three diverse HAR scenarios (RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture), yielding accuracy gains of 3.73%, 17.38%, and 3.70% respectively after deploying personalization on embedded platforms.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that fast, lightweight personalization is feasible for HAR systems on embedded platforms, advancing scalable, user-aware systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

*Miha OÅ¾bot,Igor Å krjanc*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast dissimilarity measure to detect overlap in multivariate Gaussian clusters, addressing challenges in online learning from streaming data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clustering from streaming data by addressing the inadequacies of existing dissimilarity measures in detecting overlapping clusters and their computational inefficiencies.

Method: The authors devised a novel dissimilarity measure optimized for identifying cluster overlap and designed processes to ensure computational efficiency and avoid merging orthogonal clusters.

Result: The proposed method is significantly faster than existing measures and successfully detects overlapping clusters while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach enhances online learning algorithms by providing a faster, effective solution for identifying overlapping clusters and supporting adaptive clustering models for streaming data.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

*Chengcan Wu,Zeming Wei,Huanran Chen,Yinpeng Dong,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces the Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP), an approach to ensure model safety by permanently eliminating harmful information from Large Language Models while retaining useful knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about safety in Large Language Models arise due to their ability to store unsafe knowledge internally. Existing unlearning methods fail to remove information traces completely, making them prone to relearning attacks.

Method: The MRP method utilizes irreversible projection properties by implementing projective transformations within the hidden state spaces of specific network layers, ensuring harmful information is permanently removed while preserving useful knowledge.

Result: Experimental results show that MRP performs effective continuous unlearning, defends against relearning attacks, and achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness while maintaining natural model performance.

Conclusion: MRP addresses key limitations of existing unlearning methods, offering a solution that ensures model safety without compromising performance. The approach is poised as a significant step forward in safe and reliable machine learning systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

*H. I. Nurdin,C. A. Nijhuis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines a solvable one-state differential equation model for a molecular switch inspired by synaptic brain functions, exploring its potential for stable sequential data learning and neuromorphic computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the theoretical potential and mathematical properties supporting the use of a dynamic molecular switch as a computational unit mimicking brain-like behavior.

Method: Analyzed an input-driven differential equation model for its exact solvability, biological plausibility, and convergence properties to ensure stable input signal processing.

Result: The model exhibits both biologically-inspired behavior and properties like fading memory, offering a stable framework for sequential data learning in computing architectures.

Conclusion: The findings support the utility of the model in neuromorphic computing scenarios and suggest its potential in developing more general models for stable computation and brain-inspired behavior emulation.

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

*Jianhui Wang,Wenyu Zhu,Bowen Gao,Xin Hong,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Yanyan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes HypSeek, a hyperbolic representation learning framework enhancing protein-ligand binding prediction for drug discovery, significantly improving virtual screening and affinity ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein-ligand binding prediction methods struggle with modeling hierarchical structures and fine-grained molecular interaction variations using Euclidean embeddings.

Method: HypSeek embeds ligands, protein pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, leveraging its negative curvature and geometry while employing a protein-guided three-tower architecture.

Result: HypSeek improves performance on DUD-E virtual screening (+20.7%) and JACS affinity ranking correlation (+25.4%), showcasing hyperbolic geometry's modeling advantages.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry is a beneficial inductive bias for protein-ligand modeling, unifying affinity ranking and virtual screening in a single framework with enhanced accuracy.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairGuide addresses biases in graph neural networks by introducing fairness-guided links to improve structural fairness, showing effectiveness across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases inherent in graph structures limit the fairness of graph neural networks in downstream applications.

Method: FairGuide uses pseudo downstream community detection tasks and meta-gradient-based optimization to identify fairness-enhancing links.

Result: Experimental results reveal improved fairness and generalizability across various graph-based tasks.

Conclusion: FairGuide effectively improves structural fairness in graphs, aiding unbiased performance in downstream applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in distributed learning over networks, particularly regarding computation and communication.

Method: Introduces an ADMM-based algorithm using stochastic gradients and techniques like multiple local training epochs and compressed transmissions to enhance efficiency.

Result: Proves exact linear convergence in strongly convex problems and supports findings with numerical tests on a classification task, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed technique achieves both computation and communication efficiency while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is
jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees
computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during
local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i)
the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

### [222] [Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function: Differential Privacy without Gradient Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15523)
*Salman Habib,Remi Chou,Taejoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPOF introduces a more stable and efficient differential privacy mechanism for multi-user environments, showing better accuracy and faster performance compared to DP-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges of multi-user local differential privacy in scenarios involving heterogeneous data and environmental noise, while boosting efficiency and stability.

Method: SPOF stabilizes a Taylor-expanded polynomial approximation of a modelâs loss function and privatizes data by adding noise to the polynomial coefficients, avoiding gradient perturbation.

Result: SPOF outperforms DP-SGD by achieving up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and 57.2% faster training time in a wireless body area network scenario.

Conclusion: SPOF provides improved privacy-utility trade-offs with greater robustness and computational efficiency in multi-user differential privacy settings.

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

*Khaled M. A. Alghtus,Ayad Gannan,Khalid M. Alhajri,Ali L. A. Al Jubouri,Hassan A. I. Al-Janahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study develops a scalable method for early fault detection in industrial pump systems using sensor data and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial pump systems in harsh environments often face fault issues, making early detection critical for proactive maintenance.

Method: The approach combined dual-threshold labeling, synthetic fault signal injection, and machine learning classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM).

Result: Random Forest and XGBoost exhibited high accuracy across all classes, outperforming SVM in sensitivity to anomalies.

Conclusion: The hybrid method is robust, scalable, and adaptable to other machinery, supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-time.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure responsible machine learning model deployment, especially in critical domains like healthcare and finance, there is a need to understand the nuanced performance of these models.

Method: By combining Conformal Prediction with Exceptional Model Mining, the framework identifies cohesive subgroups within data, using a new model class (mSMoPE) and a quality metric (RAUL) for exceptional performance analysis in multi-class classification and regression.

Result: The framework uncovers interpretable data subgroups and provides critical insights into model behavior across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: This framework enhances model interpretability and reliability, contributing to explainable AI and state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

### [225] [Inductive Domain Transfer In Misspecified Simulation-Based Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15593)
*Ortal Senouf,Antoine Wehenkel,CÃ©dric Vincent-Cuaz,Emmanuel AbbÃ©,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for simulation-based inference (SBI) that overcomes challenges of scalability and generalization by combining calibration and distributional alignment in a single end-to-end trainable model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation-based inference struggles with model misspecification caused by mismatches between simulations and real-world data. Existing approaches like RoPE tackle this but face scalability issues due to reliance on test sample batches during inference.

Method: The authors present a fully inductive and amortized approach utilizing mini-batch optimal transport (OT) to align real and simulated observations and train a conditional normalizing flow to approximate posterior distributions under misalignment.

Result: The proposed method equals or exceeds the performance of RoPE and other standard SBI methods across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, offering improved scalability in handling model misspecifications.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient, scalable, and broadly applicable solution for inference in misspecified environments, eliminating the need for simulation access during test time.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

### [226] [Continual Neural Topic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15612)
*Charu Karakkaparambil James,Waleed Mustafa,Marius Kloft,Sophie Fellenz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM) that aims to overcome challenges in continual topic learning by using a global prior distribution to maintain memory of past topics. It outperforms existing models in predicting topic quality and capturing temporal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to continual learning in topic models either lack the ability to maintain long-term memory or require entire datasets for updates. This paper aims to bridge these gaps and provide an efficient solution for dynamic scenarios.

Method: The authors propose the CoNTM model that uses a global prior distribution updated over time. This approach enables continuous learning of topics without forgetting previously learned information.

Result: Experimental results show that CoNTM outperforms Dynamic Topic Models in terms of topic quality, predictive perplexity, and its ability to capture temporal changes online.

Conclusion: CoNTM offers a robust solution for continual topic learning by addressing memory retention and diversity in topics while adapting dynamically to temporal shifts.

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

*Wei Herng Choong,Jixing Liu,Ching-Yu Kao,Philip Sperl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRASPED, an unsupervised model for graph anomaly detection that uses spectral and wavelet-based techniques to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address limitations in current graph anomaly detection methods, such as reliance on labeled data in supervised approaches and limited spectral analysis in unsupervised methods.

Method: The method involves a Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder and a Wiener Graph Deconvolution-based decoder to capture multi-band spectral information for graph anomaly detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that GRASPED outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection models.

Conclusion: GRASPED effectively leverages spectral and wavelet-based techniques to improve unsupervised graph anomaly detection. The approach successfully captures both global and local graph information for accurate anomaly identification.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

*Lucas Gautheron,Evan Kidd,Anton Malko,Marvin Lavechin,Alejandrina Cristia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates how classification errors in automated audio analysis affect scientific measurements and proposes a Bayesian calibration method to mitigate bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the insufficient focus in prior literature on the downstream impacts of classification errors in analyzing children's language acquisition data.

Method: A Bayesian approach is utilized to assess the influence of algorithmic errors on estimates, employing popular classifiers like LENA and ACLEW's Voice Type Classifier.

Result: The study shows significant distortions in estimate accuracy, such as underestimating the negative sibling effect by up to 80%.

Conclusion: While Bayesian calibration can recover unbiased effect size estimates, it is not a flawless solution, emphasizing caution in using automated classifiers with error rates.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

### [229] [Correct-By-Construction: Certified Individual Fairness through Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15642)
*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework to guarantee individual fairness during machine learning model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning algorithms often fail to maintain individual fairness, and current techniques lack formal guarantees of achieving such fairness.

Method: The framework combines provably fair initialization and a fairness-preserving training algorithm using randomized response mechanisms to ensure fairness.

Result: Experimental results showed that the proposed framework produces models that are both accurate and empirically fair, while being more efficient than certified training methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively ensures fairness during training and offers both empirical and provable guarantees of individual fairness.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

TL;DR: The paper introduces AICMET, a transformer-based framework to predict pharmacokinetics (drug effects) accurately in sparse data conditions, combining Bayesian inference and mechanistic prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dose-response prediction accuracy in precision pharmacotherapy despite challenges like sparse sampling and high inter-patient variability.

Method: The AICMET model integrates transformer-based architecture with latent-variable frameworks to pre-train with synthetic pharmacokinetic data and adapt to new compounds using Bayesian inference. It operates on minimal data with zero-shot learning techniques.

Result: AICMET achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, accommodates inter-patient variability, and outperforms existing methods like nonlinear mixed-effects models and neural ODE approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer-based population-aware models like AICMET can revolutionize personalized pharmacokinetic modeling by reducing time, improving accuracy, and supporting tailored drug dosing regimens effectively.

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

*Eric Ye,Ren Tao,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open-ended multi-agent environment for studying socially intelligent AI agents, focusing on their learning and behavior in the presence of experts and collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for intelligent AI agents capable of operating in real-world settings with inherent multi-agent interactions, which reflect human social dynamics, drives the research in this paper.

Method: The researchers created a complex, multi-agent environment where agents can pursue diverse goals. They analyzed agents' performance in scenarios involving social learning, working alongside experts, implicit collaboration, and competition.

Result: The study investigated how social learning and implicit cooperation, such as tool sharing and fighting common enemies, can enhance agents' performance in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The environment can foster socially intelligent behaviors in AI agents and provides a platform to explore the balance of cooperation and competition to achieve long-term goals.

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

*Qifeng Hu,Shamsulhaq Basir,Inanc Senocak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces enhancements to the PECANN framework for solving partial differential equations with improved robustness, efficiency, and applicability over established methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in solving demanding partial differential equations in scientific computing by improving accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: The authors propose multi-parameter augmented Lagrangian methods, expectation-based constraint reformulation, Fourier feature mappings, time-windowing strategies, and a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU).

Result: PECANN-CAPU demonstrated competitive accuracy and improved constraint enforcement across diverse numerical experiments, including transonic rarefaction, Helmholtz equations, and inverse identification problems.

Conclusion: The advances established in PECANN-CAPU enhance its robustness, efficiency, and expand its applicability for solving PDEs in scientific computing.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

### [233] [Communication Efficient LLM Pre-training with SparseLoCo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15706)
*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin ThÃ©rien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo is a communication-efficient training algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs) that achieves significant reductions in communication while maintaining or exceeding model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the communication bottleneck in training Large Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, as existing methods are inefficient and degrade performance compared to simple baselines.

Method: The proposed method, SparseLoCo, leverages Top-k sparsification and quantization (as low as 2-bit) alongside error feedback to approximate outer momentum and achieve extreme compression ratios.

Result: SparseLoCo achieves compression ratios of 1-3% sparsity while improving model performance over the full-precision baseline in communication-constrained LLM training scenarios.

Conclusion: SparseLoCo demonstrates that extreme compression through sparsification and quantization not only reduces communication costs but can also enhance performance, making it a viable solution for distributed LLM training.

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

*Mohammed Elmusrati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey connecting classical estimation theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, illustrating shared probabilistic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how techniques in machine learning address uncertainty and connect probabilistic principles to practical applications.

Method: Unified mathematical framework analyzing estimation and inference techniques alongside modern AI methods such as deep learning and large language models.

Result: Clarified the shared probabilistic foundations of methods like Bayesian inference and attention mechanisms, showing their application in handling noisy data.

Conclusion: Machine learning methods, despite their complexity, derive from shared probabilistic goals of inferring meaning from uncertainty, serving as a theoretical and practical guide for learners and researchers.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

*Joonas JÃ¤rve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of likelihood-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in generative models by testing a Variational Diffusion Model trained on representation space rather than pixel space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI machine-learning systems face safety concerns in deployment, primarily due to challenges in out-of-distribution detection which is critical for identifying data outside the training distribution.

Method: The authors trained a Variational Diffusion Model on the representation space (from a pre-trained ResNet-18) instead of pixel space to evaluate likelihood-based OOD detection, comparing its efficacy against methods in the OpenOOD suite.

Result: The study provides insights into whether representation spaces perform better for likelihood-based OOD detection compared to pixel spaces.

Conclusion: Likelihood-based OOD detection may face challenges in pixel space, but using representation spaces could enhance its efficacy, offering promise for improved OOD safety measures in generative models.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Intern-S1, a 28-billion activated parameter multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) foundation model targeting scientific domains, which outperforms open-source and closed-source models in professional scientific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant performance gap between open-source and closed-source foundation models in high-value, complex scientific fields, hindering scientific research progress.

Method: The authors developed Intern-S1, a multimodal MoE model with 28B activated and 241B total parameters. It was pretrained on 5T tokens (over 2.5T from scientific domains) and fine-tuned with offline and online reinforcement learning using a Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) framework across 1000+ tasks.

Result: Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive general reasoning capabilities among open-source models and surpasses state-of-the-art performance on specialized professional tasks, like molecular synthesis planning and prediction of thermodynamic stability.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 bridges the gap in performance for scientific tasks between open-source and closed-source models and represents a step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

*Kiarash Kazari,Ezzeldin Shereen,GyÃ¶rgy DÃ¡n*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The research introduces a decentralized detector for identifying adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces, achieving strong performance across tested environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting adversarial attacks in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning environments, especially with continuous action spaces.

Method: The method involves using a decentralized detection mechanism based on agents' local observations. Deep neural networks approximate normal agent behavior as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling a statistical detection mechanism using a two-sided CUSUM procedure.

Result: The proposed detection method achieved over 0.95 AUC-ROC scores across evaluated PettingZoo environments, effectively identifying impactful adversarial attacks and outperforming its discrete counterpart.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully detects adversarial attacks in real-time for multi-agent reinforcement learning environments, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness compared to other methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how transformers can tackle complex algebraic problems like multivariate polynomial decomposition, an NP-hard task with science and engineering applications.

Method: Synthetic data generation, supervised learning-based evaluation, and introduction of BGRPO, a reinforcement learning technique for improving accuracy and efficiency.

Result: BGRPO reduces beam width by up to half and decreases inference compute by ~75%. The model performs competitively, surpassing Mathematica in certain polynomial simplification tasks.

Conclusion: Transformers, combined with innovative approaches like BGRPO, hold promise in solving computationally challenging and precise algebraic tasks.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

*Vivaan Singhvi,Joey Wagner,Emily Dolson,Luis Zaman,Matthew Andres Moreno*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a faster algorithm for reconstructing phylogenies in agent-based simulations, achieving notable speedups in large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in memory constraints and computational demands for reconstructing phylogenies in digital evolution experiments, particularly for large-scale datasets.

Method: An enhanced trie-building algorithm is proposed for reconstructing phylogenies efficiently, offering equivalency to existing methods but with substantially improved performance.

Result: The improved algorithm demonstrated a 300-fold speedup for 10,000-tip trees and successfully reconstructed billion-genome datasets from AI accelerator simulations within hours.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundational advancement in high-throughput phyloanalysis methods for enabling detailed and scalable investigations in digital evolution experiments.

Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run
evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail.
Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital
experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and
open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for
bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware
accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine
(WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be
investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality
characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking
phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary
stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to
facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital
organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies
from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving
large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm
designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For
modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold
speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome
datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication
events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials,
achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In
substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work
establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis
techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

*John E. Hummel,Rachel F. Heaton*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper investigates the minimal cognitive requirements for symbolic thought in humans, suggesting that dynamic binding, multi-place predicates, and structure mapping are essential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of why humans can perform symbolic reasoning while most other species cannot and to uncover the minimal cognitive requirements enabling this ability.

Method: The study conducted 17 systematically designed simulations to compare cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping, ensuring tasks relied solely on these abilities rather than external cues or diagnostic features.

Result: The findings support the hypothesis that symbolic reasoning minimally requires not only dynamic binding but also the integration of multi-place predicates and structure mapping.

Conclusion: The findings advance knowledge on symbolic thought in humans, highlighting key factors differentiating biological intelligence from machine learning approaches while offering insights for the development of bio-inspired AI systems.

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

*Ziteng Wang,Ruijie Fang,Linus Zheng,Dixin Tang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a homomorphism calculus to verify or refute dataframe homomorphism in user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling efficient execution in data processing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from the inefficiency in executing UDAFs within data frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink when they do not satisfy the homomorphism property.

Method: The paper proposes a novel homomorphism calculus that checks UDAFs for dataframe homomorphism and constructs merge operators for incremental and parallel computation.

Result: The implementation of the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios shows superior performance compared to other leading synthesizers.

Conclusion: The homomorphism calculus provides a valuable tool for efficient execution of UDAFs, advancing data framework performance through enhanced parallelism and incremental computation.

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

*Ruijie Fang,Zachary Kincaid,Thomas Reps*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS, which uses a novel two-layered search strategy and static analysis to efficiently find bugs and ensure safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing software model-checking tools struggle with programs containing long, input-dependent error paths, requiring improved techniques for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The authors propose GPS, a model-checking algorithm that uses compositional, summary-based static analysis to guide state-space search and employs a two-layered search strategy. It incorporates an instrumentation technique to achieve refutation-completeness.

Result: Experimental benchmarks on SV-COMP and other literature show that GPS outperforms state-of-the-art checkers in solving more benchmarks and running faster.

Conclusion: GPS offers an efficient and refutationally complete approach to software model checking, excelling in detecting bugs and verifying program safety.

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

### [243] [Big-Stop Semantics: A Simple Way to Get the Benefits of Small-Step Semantics in a Big-Step Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15157)
*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'big-stop semantics,' an extension of big-step semantics that captures diverging computations (like infinite loops) without introducing error states, enhancing its capability compared to small-step semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Big-step semantics are popular for their simplicity and efficiency but lack the ability to describe diverging program behaviors, which small-step semantics can handle. A solution is needed to bridge this gap.

Method: The paper expands standard big-step semantics by adding a few inference rules that make its evaluation judgment equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions, avoiding complex constructs like coinduction or excessive rules.

Result: The extended framework, called big-stop semantics, is demonstrated to handle divergence effectively without sacrificing ergonomic advantages, showing applicability in multiple types of programming languages.

Conclusion: Big-stop semantics offers a practical and simple way to capture divergent behaviors while keeping the benefits of big-step semantics, overcoming some limitations present in other methods from literature.

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

*Jingbo Wang,Shashin Halalingaiah,Weiyi Chen,Chao Wang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Praline, an extension to Datalog, for handling probabilistic inference with partially known input correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic logic programming languages like ProbLog do not account for statistical correlations among input facts, limiting inferential accuracy.

Method: The authors propose treating probabilistic inference as a constrained optimization problem. They further develop a scalable $
\delta$-exact inference algorithm leveraging constraint solving, static analysis, and iterative refinement.

Result: Praline delivers precise probability bounds for output facts and scales effectively in real-world settings such as side-channel analysis.

Conclusion: Praline effectively combines probabilistic reasoning and scalability, addressing limitations of previous approaches in handling input correlations.

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

*Patrick Redmond,Jonathan Castello,JosÃ© Manuel CalderÃ³n Trilla,Lindsey Kuper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a formal model, Core ECS, for understanding the Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern and explores its deterministic concurrent programming capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ECS pattern is widely used in game development but remains poorly understood outside of specific domains. Existing explanations are tied to specific implementations or rely on flawed metaphors.

Method: The authors designed a formal model for ECS called Core ECS to abstract essential aspects of the pattern and enable deterministic concurrency. They also compared this model with existing ECS frameworks.

Result: Core ECS identifies deterministic behaviors in certain classes of programs and highlights unexploited opportunities for deterministic concurrency in existing frameworks.

Conclusion: Core ECS provides a rigorous foundation for understanding ECS and highlights avenues for improved implementation techniques in ECS frameworks with deterministic concurrency.

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

Motivation: To enhance modeling of distributed and business process systems, incorporating concurrency and resource-awareness.

Method: Combines graded semantics techniques for sequential programs with fair termination methods from synchronous sessions.

Result: Developed a core calculus and accompanying type system for resource-aware active objects.

Conclusion: Well-typed programs under this system are guaranteed to fairly terminate.

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

### [247] [Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576)
*Andreas LÃ¶Ã¶w,Seung Hoon Park,Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho,Sacha-Ãlie Ayoun,Opale SjÃ¶stedt,Philippa Gardner*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a formal foundation for memory-model-parametric Compositional Symbolic Execution (CSE) platforms, addressing gaps in flexibility and soundness for various memory models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CSE platforms, like Gillian, demonstrate the potential of custom memory models for more flexible and performant analyses, but lack a formal foundation for supporting this parameterization.

Method: The authors mechanized the foundation in the interactive theorem prover Rocq, validated it with memory models like C and CHERI, and extended the applicability to both Separation Logic (SL) and Incorrectness Separation Logic (ISL).

Result: The paper offers a solid theoretical framework based on standard SL and ISL definitions, ensuring compatibility and sound interoperation with existing tools and platforms.

Conclusion: This formalization enhances flexibility and correctness in CSE platforms, providing a strong basis for future development and wider applicability across programming languages and tools.

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

### [248] [Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750)
*Celeste Barnaby,Qiaochu Chen,Ramya Ramalingam,Osbert Bastani,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel active learning approach for neurosymbolic program synthesis, addressing neural mispredictions with a method called constrained conformal evaluation (CCE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User interaction in program synthesis can be minimized, but existing techniques fail in neurosymbolic settings due to neural prediction errors.

Method: The proposed technique uses an iterative evaluation strategy called constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), improving precision by incorporating user feedback.

Result: Their tool SmartLabel successfully identified the correct program for 98% of tested benchmarks, with less than 5 interaction rounds on average.

Conclusion: The new active learning technique significantly outperforms prior methods, making it a promising solution for neurosymbolic program synthesis.

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

*Murilo Vinicius da Silva,Matheus Hipolito Carvalho,Juliano Negri,Thiago Segreto,Gustavo J. G. Lahr,Ricardo V. Godoy,Marcelo Becker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces an intuitive teleoperation method for quadruped robots using vision-based pose estimation to enhance safety and ease of control for robotic arms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current teleoperation for quadruped robots is challenging due to non-intuitive control methods, high operator cognitive load, and collision risks, particularly in hazardous or dynamic workspaces.

Method: The proposed method employs an external camera with a machine learning-based pose estimation system to detect operator wrist movements, mapping them to robotic arm commands. It includes a trajectory planner for collision avoidance.

Result: Validation on a real robot showcased robust, real-time performance of the proposed system, effectively controlling the robotic arm while ensuring operational safety.

Conclusion: The approach offers a cost-effective, intuitive teleoperation solution suitable for industrial use, prioritizing safety, precision, and ease of use in high-risk environments.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

*RenÃ© ZurbrÃ¼gg,Andrei Cramariuc,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for generating a diverse dataset of physically feasible robotic grasps to enhance the capabilities of dexterous robotic hands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit dexterous robotic hands fully, diverse and high-quality grasp data is crucial as existing grasp synthesis approaches often lack diversity and favor simple grasps.

Method: The method introduces a differentiable energy formulation of force closure defined through a Quadratic Program (QP) and an optimized algorithm (MALA*) to improve grasp synthesis.

Result: The approach significantly enhances grasp diversity and stability, yielding a large-scale grasp dataset for 5,700 objects with diverse grasp types.

Conclusion: The proposed method produces diverse grasp configurations, advancing robotic manipulation capabilities and addressing limitations in existing datasets.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of in-context learning through pre-trained language models to improve dynamic manipulation tasks, showcasing their effectiveness in simulation and on physical robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the reasoning abilities and few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models for addressing challenges in dynamic manipulation, such as high dimensionality and partial observability.

Method: An iterative approach where in-context learning is used to adjust a parametric policy, based on prior interactions, for dynamic manipulation tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that in-context learning via language models outperforms other methods, especially in scenarios with limited data.

Conclusion: Pre-trained language models with in-context learning show promising performance in dynamic manipulation tasks, proving efficient even under low-data conditions.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scalable, decentralized multi-quadrotor system for monitoring wildlife using vision-based algorithms and a single onboard camera.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife monitoring methods lack scalability and efficiency, particularly in automating individual identification and behavior analysis.

Method: The system employs decentralized vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms, using onboard RGB cameras without centralized communication or control.

Result: Real-world experiments validated reliable performance in diverse, unstructured field conditions.

Conclusion: The decentralized approach enables efficient wildlife tracking and interaction, showing potential for advanced field monitoring applications.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to
identify and interact with specific individuals, enabling simultaneous
collective behavioral analysis, and health and safety interventions. Previous
robotics solutions approach the problem from the herd perspective, or are
manually operated and limited in scale. We propose a decentralized vision-based
multi-quadrotor system for wildlife monitoring that is scalable, low-bandwidth,
and sensor-minimal (single onboard RGB camera). Our approach enables robust
identification and tracking of large species in their natural habitat. We
develop novel vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms designed for
dynamic, unstructured environments without reliance on centralized
communication or control. We validate our system through real-world
experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

*Hesam Azadjou,Suraj Chakravarthi Raja,Ali Marjaninejad,Francisco J. Valero-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper builds a tendon-driven quadruped robot that learns functional locomotion in minutes using a novel bio-inspired algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots, like mammals, need to quickly adapt and learn locomotion despite incomplete knowledge of their bodies and surroundings.

Method: A bio-inspired learning algorithm, G2P, is implemented through a hardware-in-the-loop system where a quadruped robot undergoes motor babbling and refinement trials to develop adaptive movements.

Result: The quadruped robot successfully learns cyclical locomotion patterns with redundancies in under six minutes, demonstrating rapid adaptation and autonomous control.

Conclusion: This proof-of-concept highlights the efficacy of combining bio-inspired algorithms and hardware-in-the-loop methods for adaptive robotic locomotion in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Result: The survey presents a detailed analysis of VLA development and identifies challenges and future research directions for real-world applications.

Conclusion: VLA models hold immense potential for advancing embodied intelligence, but overcoming deployment challenges and refining training methodologies remain critical for their progression.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence systems, which enhance agent capabilities through
continuous environment interactions, have garnered significant attention from
both academia and industry. Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by
advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control
frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction
capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened
application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively
reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the
developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a

*William McDonald,Cedric Le Gentil,Jennifer Wakulicz,Teresa Vidal-Calleja*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mag-Match, a novel feature extraction and description method for registering 3D magnetic field maps, particularly robust in challenging conditions like smoke or dust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map registration methods with cameras or LiDARs fail in environments with visual obstructions (e.g., smoke or dust), necessitating alternative robust approaches like magnetometer-based methods.

Method: The method extracts features from 3D magnetic vector field maps using higher-order derivatives and a physics-informed Gaussian Process for probabilistic inference, eliminating reliance on gravitational alignment.

Result: Mag-Match demonstrates accurate registration in both simulated and real-world experiments, outperforming a SIFT-based approach, even without gravitational alignment.

Conclusion: Mag-Match presents a robust alternative for map registration and demonstrates strong potential in applications where cameras or LiDARs are ineffective.

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

TL;DR: Lang2Lift is a framework that automates the pallet pick-up operation using natural language-guided perception pipelines, achieving reliable performance for autonomous forklifts in logistics and construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address labor shortages, safety issues, and inefficiencies in manually locating and retrieving pallets in outdoor, unstructured environments.

Method: The Lang2Lift framework integrates language-guided pallet detection and 6D pose estimation using Florence-2, SAM-2, and FoundationPose, combined with a motion planning module for autonomous forklift operations.

Result: Lang2Lift achieved a pallet segmentation accuracy of 0.76 mIoU and demonstrated robustness in real-world logistics and construction settings.

Conclusion: The system showcases the feasibility of automating pallet handling operations in complex environments using natural language commands, enhancing efficiency and safety.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional drone task planning lacks robustness and adaptability, particularly in addressing continuous and dynamic operations.

Method: The method combines continuous state evaluation for robust task outcome determination and a hierarchical Behavior Tree modification model for reflective learning.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in success rate (44.87% better than baselines) and outstanding performance in real-world scenarios with a success rate of 96.25%.

Conclusion: SRDrone integrates LLM-based reasoning with stringent drone execution constraints, achieving notable advancements in industrial drone task planning.

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the

TL;DR: Proposes Kitchen-R, a benchmark system for evaluating both task planning and low-level control in robotic systems using a simulated kitchen scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking in robotics and embodied AI lacks integration between high-level task planning and low-level robot control, hindering comprehensive evaluations.

Method: Developed Kitchen-R with over 500 language instructions in a digital twin kitchen environment using Isaac Sim simulator, offering tools for independent and integrated evaluation modes.

Result: Implemented baseline methods for task planning and control, showcasing capabilities of Kitchen-R to assess robotic systems holistically.

Conclusion: Kitchen-R addresses the gap in embodied AI research by unifying evaluations of planning and control, contributing toward realistic assessments of robotic systems.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

*Annie S. Chen,Philemon Brakel,Antonia Bronars,Annie Xie,Sandy Huang,Oliver Groth,Maria Bauza,Markus Wulfmeier,Nicolas Heess,Dushyant Rao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Pause-Induced Perturbations" (PIP) to tackle policy idling in dexterous robotic manipulation, showing improvements in reliability and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned policies in robotic manipulation lack robustness and fail due to idling, driven by inadequate training data in states requiring precision. Existing solutions introduce trade-offs in performance, prompting exploration of alternative approaches.

Method: The authors propose PIP, a method that perturbs robots at detected idling states to assist escape from problematic zones, improving policy toward better performance and iterative improvement.

Result: PIP improves test-time performance in several challenging simulated dual-arm tasks and achieves a 15-35% increase in success rates in real-world multi-finger manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed PIP method is effective in preventing policy idling, driving notable improvements in the reliability of learned robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

*Gargi Das,Daegyun Choi,Donghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a trajectory optimization algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems by leveraging dynamic coupling rather than minimizing it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how dynamic coupling can be utilized instead of minimized in trajectory optimization for space manipulator systems.

Method: Singular value decomposition of the dynamic coupling matrix is performed alongside a metric for coupling strength and directionality, which is then integrated into the optimization framework.

Result: Simulation results indicate that accounting for dynamic coupling improves trajectory planning and system efficiency.

Conclusion: Dynamic coupling, when carefully considered, offers actionable insights for trajectory optimization and control in free-floating space manipulator systems.

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

*Jie Xu,Eric Heiden,Iretiayo Akinola,Dieter Fox,Miles Macklin,Yashraj Narang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), a novel neural simulator for robots structured as articulated rigid bodies, offering improved prediction, generalization, and fine-tuning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulation of modern robots is difficult due to their complexity and existing neural simulators' lack of generalization abilities across tasks and environments.

Method: The authors propose integrating a neural-based dynamics model (NeRD) with a robot-centric, spatially-invariant state representation into a robotics simulator, replacing traditional low-level dynamics solvers.

Result: NeRD demonstrated stability, accuracy over extended simulation steps, task/environment generalization, and adaptability to real-world data for bridging the sim-to-reality gap.

Conclusion: NeRD improves simulation performance and adaptability, enabling more versatile and realistic modeling and helping bridge the gap between simulation and real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

### [263] [On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135)
*Sumudu Liyanage,Sherlock A. Licorish,Markus Wagner,Stephen G. MacDonell*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the state-of-the-art automated program repair tool, Sorald, and finds that while it fixes code violations, it also introduces new issues and reduces code quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated program repair (APR) tools are widely used to fix code issues, but existing evaluations focus only on their success in resolving detected violations without considering potential unintended side effects.

Method: The authors assess Sorald's performance on 3,529 SonarQube violations across 30 rules in Java code snippets from Stack Overflow and evaluate its tendency to introduce new bugs, impact functional correctness, and degrade code structure.

Result: Sorald successfully addressed specific rule violations but introduced 2,120 new issues, including 32 bugs and 2088 code smells, caused a 24% failure rate in unit tests, and reduced overall code structure quality.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity of comprehensive evaluation methodologies for APR tools to ensure that they improve code quality without introducing harmful side effects.

Abstract: In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary
in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code
quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis
profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability
to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes
severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code
structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess
comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this
research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of
concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube
violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack
Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it
introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code
functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and
degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings
emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum
of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective
adoption.

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating GenAI capabilities with software engineering principles to develop reliable and efficient systems and introduces design concepts and architectures for this integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address GenAI's unpredictability and inefficiency in developing robust systems and to advocate for a combination of GenAI cognitive capabilities with tried-and-true software engineering practices.

Method: It introduces GenAI-native design principles (reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, assurance) and proposes architectural patterns (GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, programmable routers) supported by discussions on software stacks.

Result: Key elements of a GenAI-native environment are identified, and perspectives on its impact across technical, economic, legal, and user adoption areas are provided while stressing the need for validation.

Conclusion: The paper encourages further research and implementation of this GenAI-native framework to create adaptive and self-evolving systems and highlights its transformative potential.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should
integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering
principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

### [265] [An Empirical Study of Knowledge Distillation for Code Understanding Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15423)
*Ruiqi Wang,Zezhou Yang,Cuiyun Gao,Xin Xia,Qing Liao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation (KD) effectively compresses pre-trained language models for code understanding, enabling efficient inference while preserving high performance. Latest feature-based KD methods retain up to 98% of teacher model performance with only 5% of the parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying pre-trained language models (PLMs) for large-scale code understanding remains computationally expensive and slow, necessitating efficient model compression techniques like KD.

Method: The study explores two KD techniques: logit-based and feature-based methods, applying them to eight student models and two teacher PLMs across three code understanding tasks.

Result: Experiments show consistent performance improvement from KD, with feature-based methods retaining up to 98% of teacher performance with only 5% of the parameters. Code-specific teacher PLMs perform better.

Conclusion: KD proves highly effective for code understanding, with feature-based methods excelling. Student model architecture does not necessarily benefit from similarity to the teacher. Findings suggest future research directions in KD efficiency and behaviors.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

*Dongjun Yu,Xiao Yan,Zhenrui Li,Jipeng Xiao,Haochuan He,Yongda Yu,Hao Zhang,Guoping Rong,Xiaobo Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SynthCoder, a new code completion model, integrates diverse datasets, contextual enhancements, and a two-stage training pipeline to achieve state-of-the-art performance in Fill-in-the-Middle tasks, outperforming multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code completion models often face trade-offs in optimizing performance across datasets and metrics, with a need for comprehensive solutions that aim to lift overall model capability.

Method: SynthCoder employs diverse datasets through AST node heuristics and BM25 algorithm enhancements, combines a two-stage training process (curriculum learning and alignment via Direct Preference Optimization), and utilizes an enriched contextual corpus for training.

Result: Experimental validation reveals SynthCoder achieves superior performance in multiple repository-level benchmarks and mitigates issues like code repetition seen in traditional models.

Conclusion: By combining advanced dataset construction, contextual enrichment, and optimized training methodologies, SynthCoder sets a new standard for industry-grade code completion in various scenarios.

Abstract: Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this
task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,
supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,
these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect
where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied
by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's
performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading
industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct
a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with
heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus
with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call
graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both
file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a
two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.
First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following
this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results
demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code
completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and
CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the
model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in
various code completion models.

*Elena Masserini,Diego Clerissi,Daniela Micucci,JoÃ£o R. Campos,Leonardo Mariani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces two datasets, TOFU-R and BRASATO, alongside supporting tools, to aid in evaluating chatbot quality, reliability, and robustness, addressing limitations in existing datasets and methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address gaps in the reliability and robustness assessment of task-based chatbots, caused by a lack of high-quality datasets and outdated evaluation techniques.

Method: The authors created two datasets: TOFU-R, a GitHub snapshot of open-source Rasa chatbots, and BRASATO, a curated dataset focusing on dialogue and functional complexity, enriched by tool support for creation and maintenance.

Result: TOFU-R reflects the current practice of open-source chatbot development, while BRASATO facilitates reproducibility and supports research, offering curated examples of functionally diverse, utility-driven chatbots.

Conclusion: These resources enhance the landscape of chatbot reliability research by enabling better evaluation techniques and fostering further studies in the field.

Abstract: Task-based chatbots are increasingly being used to deliver real services, yet
assessing their reliability, security, and robustness remains underexplored,
also due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets. The emerging
automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on
limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no
longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of
such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support
necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA
TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa
chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in
open-source chatbot development with Rasa. The second dataset is BOT RASA
COLLECTION (BRASATO), a curated selection of the most relevant chatbots for
dialogue complexity, functional complexity, and utility, whose goal is to ease
reproducibility and facilitate research on chatbot reliability.

TL;DR: This paper outlines a taxonomy and guidelines for conducting and reporting empirical studies involving large language models (LLMs) to ensure transparency and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used in software engineering research, but their non-deterministic nature, lack of transparent training data, and evolving architectures make it difficult to reproduce and replicate studies.

Method: The researchers developed a taxonomy of LLM-based study types and proposed eight guidelines covering essential and desirable criteria to promote transparency and reproducibility in research involving LLMs.

Result: The paper introduces specific recommendations such as declaring LLM roles, disclosing model versions and configurations, and using open LLMs as baselines, aiming to help overcome LLM-specific barriers in open science.

Conclusion: The guidelines function as a foundation to enable reproducibility and replicability in studies involving LLMs, with a focus on transparency. Additionally, they are presented as a living resource for ongoing community use and adaptation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
engineering (SE) research and practice, yet their non-determinism, opaque
training data, and evolving architectures complicate the reproduction and
replication of empirical studies. We present a community effort to scope this
space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight
guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The
guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should)
criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our
recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM
usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning;
(3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction
logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7)
to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly
articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility
and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain
the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to
use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).

*Markus Borg,Martin Larsson,Philip Breid,Nadim Hagatulah*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores how maintainability is often neglected in software development and proposes a model (QUPER-MAn) to address this gap by integrating benchmarks and supporting responsible target-setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of software maintainability being overlooked despite its critical role in sustainable development. The authors argue requirements engineering can play a significant part in improving this situation.

Method: An exploratory study of industry practices and the development of a maintainability-adapted version of the QUPER model, named QUPER-MAn, using a design science approach.

Result: Findings confirm that maintainability is a secondary concern, often addressed implicitly through coding conventions and tools. QUPER-MAn is proposed as a solution for explicitly managing maintainability requirements.

Conclusion: QUPER-MAn has the potential to elevate maintainability from a neglected consequence to a managed engineering goal, aiding informed decision-making within organizations.

Abstract: Maintainable source code is essential for sustainable development in any
software organization. Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability
often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that
requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering
discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this
preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices
related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm
previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern.
Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions.
Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in
implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we
propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was
originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance
requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates
maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can
shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively
managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.

### [270] [A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536)
*Yi Zhang,He Jiang,Xiaochen Li,Shikai Guo,Peiyu Zou,Zun Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces VERMEI, a method to improve testing for FPGA logic synthesis tools by generating more complex test programs and identifying bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of existing methods in testing FPGA tools, particularly the lack of semantic and logical complexity in test programs.

Method: VERMEI employs three modules: preprocessing to identify zombie logic in programs, equivalent mutation using Bayesian sampling to create complex variants, and bug identification through differential testing.

Result: Experiments show VERMEI surpasses existing methods in bug detection; it identified 15 bugs in tools like Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus within five months, with 9 confirmed as new.

Conclusion: VERMEI enhances tool testing by effectively generating complex test cases and identifying bugs, contributing to greater reliability in FPGA synthesis tools.

Abstract: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components
in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware
designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level
representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to
unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to
harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed
to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of
insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper,
we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI
consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug
identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code
with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and
coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants
of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It
uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog
designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and
structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing,
compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs.
Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to
vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.

TL;DR: The study established a TD management (TDM) process in an IT company, focusing on sustainable TD awareness and practical adoption of research concepts through workshops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study sought to bridge the gap between research in technical debt management (TDM) and its adoption in practice, emphasizing the need for effective TDM processes.

Method: The researchers conducted action research, involving five cycles over 16 months, with questionnaires, observations, a psychology-based awareness method called TD-SAGAT, and backlog data analysis.

Result: Practitioners preferred prioritizing and repaying TD items based on system evolution and cost-effectiveness. Tools like backlog checkboxes and templates sustainably increased TD awareness.

Conclusion: A workshop-based approach to TDM is both feasible and effective in initiating sustainable process changes, while generating scalable ideas for broader IT team application.

Abstract: Context. Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system
providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM)
is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed
to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop
concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each
TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used
action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates
IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed
questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3)
adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making
situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results.
Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's
evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging
fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates,
led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a
workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes.
New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a
re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations
for TD prioritization.

*Yijin Ni,Xiaoming Huo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a kernel-based fairness criterion, $EO_k$, enhancing fair representation learning by balancing fairness objectives and prediction accuracy under different conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve fairness in machine learning by addressing discrimination against sensitive attributes while maintaining predictive performance.

Method: A novel kernel-based formulation of Equalized Odds ($EO_k$) is introduced, supported by a statistical counterpart ($\hat{EO}_k$) with concentration inequality guarantees.

Result: The new formulation satisfies key fairness objectives under unbiased and biased settings, ensuring prediction accuracy and offering analytical tradeoffs, along with efficient computation techniques.

Conclusion: The $EO_k$ criterion provides a robust theoretical framework for fairness in machine learning, paving the way for future provably fair algorithm design.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

*BjÃ¶rn Volkmann,Jan-Hendrik Ewering,Michael Meindl,Simon F. G. Ehlers,Thomas Seel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a general-purpose tool for inference and learning of dynamical systems by leveraging Bayesian methods and prior knowledge, overcoming challenges of latent states and limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of effectively modeling dynamical systems using limited data while integrating diverse prior knowledge, such as partially known equations and smoothness assumptions.

Method: The authors propose a Bayesian framework that enables online and offline inference, incorporating explicit and implicit prior knowledge without requiring user-tailored transformations.

Result: They derive closed-form densities for efficient parameter marginalization and demonstrate the tool's versatility through three case studies, including experimental data.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a consistent and scalable method for learning dynamical systems, showcasing its broad applicability and efficiency in combining data-based insights with prior knowledge.

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

### [275] [Bayesian Optimization with Expected Improvement: No Regret and the Choice of Incumbent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15674)
*Jingyi Wang,Haowei Wang,Szu Hui Ng,Cosmin G. Petra*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper analyzes cumulative regret bounds for the Gaussian Process Expected Improvement (GP-EI) algorithm in Bayesian Optimization, considering three incumbents and providing the first theoretical insights into their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread empirical success of the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function for Bayesian Optimization, its theoretical cumulative regret bounds have not been established.

Method: The authors analyze noisy GP-EI under three incumbent strategies: Best Posterior Mean Incumbent (BPMI), Best Sampled Posterior Mean Incumbent (BSPMI), and Best Observation Incumbent (BOI). They derive cumulative regret bounds for BPMI and BSPMI and investigate sublinear cumulative and noisy simple regret bounds for BOI.

Result: GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI has cumulative regret upper bounds and is no-regret for SE and MatÃ©rn kernels. GP-EI with BOI achieves either sublinear cumulative regret or fast-converging noisy simple regret under the same kernels. Numerical experiments validate these findings.

Conclusion: The paper establishes theoretical regret bounds for GP-EI in noisy settings, offering guidance for practitioners on selecting the appropriate incumbent strategy based on their applications.

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

*Ronald Richman,Salvatore Scognamiglio,Mario V. WÃ¼thrich*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a neural architecture for tabular data that captures pairwise feature interactions, shows interpretability, and achieves strong accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of modeling feature interactions, especially in applications like insurance pricing, motivated the authors to develop a method that is both accurate and intrinsically interpretable.

Method: The authors propose the PIN, a neural network structured like decision trees to focus on pairwise feature interactions. It also facilitates efficient SHAP computations for explainability.

Result: Empirical testing on a French motor insurance dataset shows that PIN achieves better accuracy than traditional and current neural network benchmarks while providing comprehension of feature interactions.

Conclusion: PIN is an accurate and interpretable neural network architecture that combines the strengths of decision trees and modern neural networks for predictive modeling with high utility in tasks like insurance pricing.

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

*Igor Rivin*

Main category: math.RA

TL;DR: The authors investigate whether $4 \times 4$ full-rank binary matrices can be expressed as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices, finding 26.3% are counterexamples and identifying emergent low-dimensional algebraic structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unresolved expressibility of full-rank $4 \times 4$ matrices as Hadamard products of rank-2 matrices and explore potential algebraic constraints.

Method: Conduct exhaustive computational searches over $\mathbb{F}_2$, verify counterexamples over $\mathbb{Z}$, analyze density correlations, and apply machine learning techniques to identify underlying parameter structures.

Result: 5,304 counterexamples were found among 20,160 binary matrices, with matrix density predicting expressibility at 95.7%. The expressible matrices were found to lie on a 10-dimensional variety instead of the expected 24-dimensional space.

Conclusion: The study unveils a low-dimensional variety, suggesting deep algebraic constraints on Hadamard factorizability, challenging previous assumptions about dimensional dependencies.

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

*Guilherme V. Moura,AndrÃ© P. Santos,Hudson S. Torrent*

Main category: q-fin.PM

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of machine learning (ML) for identifying key predictors in minimum-variance portfolio optimization, showing improved portfolio performance when compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore whether ML methods, proven effective in equity premium prediction, can enhance the selection of predictors for optimizing portfolio choices.

Method: The authors parameterize minimum-variance portfolio weights using 4,610 predictors derived from firm-level characteristics, including both non-linear transformations and cross-product terms.

Result: ML-based predictor selection significantly lowers portfolio risk and improves Sharpe ratios in certain scenarios compared to traditional sparsity-based models.

Conclusion: ML methods for variable selection enhance portfolio performance, suggesting that strict sparsity in predictor selection may hinder optimal portfolio construction.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have been successfully employed in identifying
variables that can predict the equity premium of individual stocks. In this
paper, we investigate if ML can also be helpful in selecting variables relevant
for optimal portfolio choice. To address this question, we parameterize
minimum-variance portfolio weights as a function of a large pool of firm-level
characteristics as well as their second-order and cross-product
transformations, yielding a total of 4,610 predictors. We find that the gains
from employing ML to select relevant predictors are substantial:
minimum-variance portfolios achieve lower risk relative to sparse
specifications commonly considered in the literature, especially when
non-linear terms are added to the predictor space. Moreover, some of the
selected predictors that help decreasing portfolio risk also increase returns,
leading to minimum-variance portfolios with good performance in terms of Shape
ratios in some situations. Our evidence suggests that ad-hoc sparsity can be
detrimental to the performance of minimum-variance characteristics-based
portfolios.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of graph reordering on Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) performance on GPUs, achieving up to 15% query throughput speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based ANNS has become dominant in AI applications, but current research often neglects memory layout optimization, which significantly influences GPU execution performance.

Method: The authors developed a unified evaluation framework with a graph adapter and GPU-optimized traversal engine. They evaluated various reordering strategies on diverse datasets and graph indices, using metrics to analyze structural properties versus memory layout effectiveness.

Result: Their GPU-reordering strategies improved query per second performance by up to 15% without compromising accuracy, showcasing the potential of memory layout optimizations.

Conclusion: Memory layout optimizations operate orthogonally to algorithmic innovations, offering a complementary performance boost for graph-based ANNS. Open-source code will be released to encourage further research.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to tackle issues in recommendation systems catering to niche and dynamic communities, such as cold start problems, data sparsity, and privacy concerns, where traditional methods underperform.

Method: DeepNaniNet combines user-item interactions, item-item relations, and BERT-based textual embeddings in an inductive graph-based architecture. It employs a novel content basket representation and an autoencoder-based strategy for generalization.

Result: DeepNaniNet outperformed traditional and competitive models, achieving state-of-the-art cold start performance on the CiteULike benchmark and significant improvements in recall on the AnimeULike dataset.

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet provides a robust and scalable solution for generating privacy-preserving, high-quality recommendations in challenging scenarios such as data sparsity and cold start, while effectively incorporating heterogeneous content sources.

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid recommendation system using Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) and deep neural networks, achieving high accuracy and robustness under ideal and noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the integration of quantum computing into recommendation systems to enhance data processing and pattern recognition capabilities.

Method: Combining QHAM with deep neural networks, polar pattern conversion using K-Means clustering, and training with a custom noise model in both ideal and noisy environments.

Result: In ideal conditions: ROC=0.9795, Accuracy=0.8841, F-1 Score=0.8786. In noisy conditions: ROC=0.9177, Accuracy=0.8013, F-1 Score=0.7866.

Conclusion: The proposed model performs comparably to classical methods and remains consistent in noisy environments, offering an efficient and scalable framework for real-world applications in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Few-Shot Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a black-box attack method leveraging large language models for generating persuasive adversarial documents that outperform factually accurate ones in neural ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of neural ranking models (NRMs) to adversarial manipulation and explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for generating impactful adversarial documents.

Method: The authors use few-shot prompting within LLMs to create adversarial documents, leveraging support sets of harmful examples. They propose two modes: FSAP-IntraQ (query-specific focus) and FSAP-InterQ (cross-query generalization).

Result: FSAP-produced documents consistently achieve higher rankings than credible ones, showing strong alignment and low detectability across differing queries and language models.

Conclusion: FSAP presents a scalable and realistic attack against NRMs by exploiting LLM capabilities, emphasizing the need for more robust defenses in retrieval systems.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces COSETTE and MARIUS to address challenges in generative recommender systems and improve their performance compared to traditional ID-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative recommender systems have potential but currently underperform compared to traditional ID-based approaches like SASRec. The authors aim to identify and solve key limitations preventing generative methods from realizing their full potential.

Method: The authors propose COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that incorporates collaborative signals into item representations, and MARIUS, a lightweight generative model designed to enhance efficiency and accuracy in recommendation tasks.

Result: The proposed methods significantly narrow or eliminate the performance gap between generative and state-of-the-art ID-based models on sequential recommendation benchmarks, while maintaining generative advantages.

Conclusion: COSETTE and MARIUS address inefficiencies in generative recommendation systems, offering a promising alternative to traditional ID-based systems while achieving performance parity.

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

### [284] [Personalized Recommendations via Active Utility-based Pairwise Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14911)
*Bahar Boroomand,James R. Wright*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a utility-based framework for recommender systems using pairwise comparisons to address limitations in traditional rating-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rating methods for recommender systems are limited by user biases, subjective rating scales, and the impracticality of eliciting fully ranked lists.

Method: The paper proposes a model-agnostic, utility-based framework for learning preferences through pairwise comparisons, integrating a novel active sampling strategy based on the Plackett-Luce model.

Result: The approach demonstrates versatility and effectiveness in improving recommendation accuracy and user experience through experiments involving movie recommendations and university admissions.

Conclusion: This framework offers a user-centric, data-efficient, and accurate alternative for personalized ranking across diverse applications.

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces M-$LLM^3$REC, a novel recommendation framework leveraging large language models to address cold-start and sparse-data challenges, offering personalized and robust recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current recommendation systems face challenges in cold-start and sparse-data scenarios, with existing solutions introducing noisy signals or relying on static semantic similarity.

Method: The proposed M-$LLM^3$REC framework has three key modules: MOPE (Motivation-Oriented Profile Extractor), MOTE (Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder), and MAR (Motivational Alignment Recommender), leveraging large language models for motivation-driven semantic modeling.

Result: M-$LLM^3$REC achieves significant improvements, particularly in cold-start situations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in personalization and generalization.

Conclusion: M-$LLM^3$REC offers a novel, motivation-driven approach to recommendation systems, addressing existing challenges and enhancing user experience in difficult scenarios.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper surveys retrieval methods that integrate feedback in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, bridging gaps between IR and NLP for improved iterative evidence gathering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spot weaknesses in static retrieval pipelines in RAG systems; address complex tasks requiring high-precision through feedback-integrated retrieval systems.

Method: Structured survey categorizing feedback signals by their source and role, emphasizing adaptive retrieval and ranking mechanisms.

Result: Provides an overview of advancements in dynamic retrieval and ranking architectures tailored for iterative and high-precision document retrieval.

Conclusion: Advocates for viewing retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component in end-to-end RAG frameworks to enhance NLP-IR synergy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

*Yi Xu,Moyu Zhang,Chenxuan Li,Zhihao Liao,Haibo Xing,Hao Deng,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ), a framework for improving recommender systems by addressing challenges in integrating multimodal semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems struggle to scale with large, dynamic item collections and long-tail data. Semantic IDs derived from multimodal content can improve recommendations, but current approaches face issues in balancing cross-modal synergy with uniqueness and aligning semantics with user behavior.

Method: MMQ is a two-stage framework: (1) A shared-specific tokenizer captures multimodal information using modality-specific and shared experts with orthogonal regularization; (2) Behavior-aware fine-tuning aligns semantic IDs with recommendation objectives, preserving modality information via multimodal reconstruction loss.

Result: The framework shows strong performance in offline experiments and online A/B tests, demonstrating improved scalability and effectiveness for both generative retrieval and discriminative ranking in recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: MMQ addresses key challenges in multimodal recommender systems, offering a scalable and adaptive method that balances multimodal integration with user behavior alignment.

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper argues for accounting for strategic reasoning in AI testing and using game theory to design evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI testing and evaluation often fail to account for AI systems strategically reasoning about their circumstances, which could lead to misleading safety evaluations.

Method: The paper uses examples from existing AI systems, reviews related research, and conducts a game-theoretic analysis of a simplified evaluation scenario to support its claims.

Result: Evidence is provided to show that AI systems can engage in strategic reasoning and that game theory can enhance the robustness of safety evaluations.

Conclusion: To improve deployment-related evaluations, incorporative strategic understanding and game theory-based frameworks are recommended in AI testing.

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach in medical imaging using per-pixel confidence values from radiologists to improve AI model performance, particularly in uncertain label scenarios like lung ultrasound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists often face challenges with label uncertainty in medical imaging due to inter-observer variability, especially in subjective modalities like lung ultrasound.

Method: A data annotation protocol captures radiologists' confidence in labeling each pixel, and models are trained with adjusted binarized labels based on confidence thresholds to handle uncertainty.

Result: Training with higher confidence thresholds, particularly above 60%, improved AI segmentation performance and downstream clinical tasks, such as oxygenation ratio estimation and 30-day readmission prediction.

Conclusion: Leveraging label confidence systematically enhances AI reliability and its clinical utility in medical imaging, demonstrating its potential for broader applications in uncertain diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust, accurate, and user-friendly tongue surface segmentation in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems, especially for Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, due to limitations in existing segmentation methods.

Method: The paper employs a multi-teacher knowledge distillation approach coupled with diffusion-based data augmentation to enhance generalization and reduce model parameters. The developed model was deployed as both an online and offline tool for ease of usability.

Result: The student model exhibits a 96.6% reduction in parameter size while achieving segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. It outperforms previous methods in accuracy and is presented as an accessible tool.

Conclusion: The work provides the first open-source tongue image segmentation tool, delivering high-performing segmentation and facilitating better TCM diagnosis and research by improving interpretability and usability.

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

*Andrew C. Freeman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Researchers explore data transmission methods for event-based video systems, proposing a low-latency event streaming format using Media Over QUIC protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event sensors record video asynchronously, necessitating efficient data transmission for computer vision applications.

Method: Surveying event-based systems, addressing technical challenges, and introducing a streaming format based on Media Over QUIC.

Result: Advancement in event video streaming methods, highlighting low-latency capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed format improves scalability and efficiency for computer vision-focused video transmission.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

### [292] [Zero-shot Volumetric CT Super-Resolution using 3D Gaussian Splatting with Upsampled 2D X-ray Projection Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15151)
*Jeonghyun Noh,Hyun-Jic Oh,Byungju Chae,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a zero-shot 3D CT super-resolution (SR) framework using high-resolution (HR) 2D X-ray priors generated by a diffusion model to address the challenge of limited paired datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of acquiring high-resolution CT scans due to radiation risks and the lack of large-scale paired datasets for supervised SR methods.

Method: The framework uses HR 2D X-ray data and trains a diffusion model with a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy to generate strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. This is coupled with 3D Gaussian splatting and a novel negative alpha blending mechanism for enhanced detail recovery.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two datasets for 3D CT super-resolution.

Conclusion: Leveraging HR 2D X-ray priors and innovative techniques like adaptive sampling and negative alpha blending allows the framework to reconstruct high-quality 3D CT volumes without needing paired data.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection is explored in digital pathology using a diffusion model enhanced by vision-language integration, achieving promising results in distinguishing normal and abnormal tissues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning in digital pathology is hindered by the need for extensively annotated datasets, leading to the exploration of unsupervised methods capable of working without exhaustive annotations.

Method: A diffusion model integrated with a vision-language model is used for unsupervised anomaly detection, guided by pathology-specific keywords that refine tissue reconstruction to distinguish normal and abnormal tissue.

Result: The method demonstrates strong effectiveness in detecting anomalies in a local gastric lymph node dataset and adaptability to domain shifts using a public breast lymph node dataset.

Conclusion: This approach highlights the potential for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology across various organs, leveraging innovative modeling techniques to overcome annotation challenges.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision
Transformers (Visformer-S and AutoFormer-V2-T), to guide the training of a
compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our
approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with
teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000,
covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia,
lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ
Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning
process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the
distilled student model maintains high classification performance with
significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal
choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the
importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical,
trustworthy medical AI solutions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study introduces DoSReMC, a framework to tackle domain shift and improve mammography classification generalization using targeted adaptation of Batch Normalization layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for breast cancer detection face challenges in cross-domain performance due to data distribution shifts, reducing their applicability in real-world clinical settings.

Method: The proposed framework fine-tunes only Batch Normalization (BN) and fully connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional layers, and integrates adversarial training for enhanced results.

Result: The approach reduces domain dependence of BN layers and improves cross-domain generalization, validated through evaluations on three large-scale datasets, including a newly introduced dataset.

Conclusion: DoSReMC achieves improved mammography classification performance across domains without full model retraining, and can be easily integrated into clinical AI workflows.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

### [297] [Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15553)
*Jin Ye,Jingran Wang,Fengchao Xiong,Jingzhou Chen,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising, leveraging deep equilibrium (DEQ) modeling for better consistency and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images suffer from complex noise, necessitating robust denoising methods that also maintain physical properties. Existing deep unfolding methods face limitations due to predefined network depth and lack of convergence guarantees, prompting the investigation of DEQ models for this purpose.

Method: The DECSC unifies spatial-spectral correlations, spatial self-similarities, and spatial consistency using convolutional sparse coding. It employs a shared 2D convolutional sparse representation for global consistency, unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation for local details, a transformer block for nonlocal self-similarities, and a detail enhancement module for preserving image details. Proximal gradient descent is transformed into a DEQ-based learnable architecture.

Result: The DECSC framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in HSI denoising, as validated by experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed DECSC method effectively addresses the challenges of HSI denoising by leveraging the strengths of DEQ modeling and convolutional sparse coding, delivering superior performance and maintaining key image properties.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [298] [Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15594)
*Ana C. Perre,LuÃ­s A. Alexandre,LuÃ­s C. Freire*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of artificial techniques to generate dual-energy subtracted (DES) images from low-energy (LE) images within contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), aiming to reduce radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing patient exposure to radiation in CESM imaging while maintaining diagnostic accuracy by using virtual DES images.

Method: The study investigates three models: a pre-trained U-Net, an end-to-end U-Net, and a CycleGAN for generating virtual DES images from LE images.

Result: The pre-trained U-Net model demonstrated the best performance with an F1 score of 85.59%, compared to 90.35% achieved using real DES images.

Conclusion: While virtual DES images show promise, their diagnostic performance is currently lower than real DES images. Further advancements could make virtual DES clinically viable.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores GAN-based super-resolution to enhance 4D Flow MRI, particularly for near-wall velocity measurements, demonstrating that careful GAN implementation, especially with Wasserstein GANs, improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the limitations of 4D Flow MRI, such as low spatial resolution and noise, with an emphasis on improving near-wall velocity recovery using machine learning, specifically GANs.

Method: The study implemented and evaluated three GAN architectures (Vanilla, Relativistic, and Wasserstein) using synthetic cerebrovascular models derived from MR-true pipelines to assess their ability to improve resolution and near-wall velocity accuracy.

Result: The Wasserstein GAN showed the best stability and performance, achieving lower vNRMSE compared to baseline generator-only models, especially in low SNR scenarios.

Conclusion: GANs, particularly Wasserstein GANs, demonstrate significant potential for improving 4D Flow MRI resolution and accuracy, especially in challenging cerebrovascular regions, though optimal training strategies are crucial.

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

*Paul Fischer,Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Thomas KÃ¼stner,Christian Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel MRI acquisition framework that dynamically adjusts scan time per subject based on image uncertainty, balancing efficiency with diagnostic confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI suffers from slow acquisition times, making it challenging to efficiently meet clinical precision requirements. Current methods overlook variability in individual patient needs.

Method: The framework employs a probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty during the scan. Using conformal prediction, it transforms this uncertainty into a confidence interval for quantitative metrics. The system iteratively samples k-space and adjusts scan time until a user-defined precision is achieved.

Result: Validated on knee and cardiac MRI datasets, the proposed method reduced scan times compared to fixed protocols while guaranteeing precision in images.

Conclusion: The study introduces a paradigm shift towards dynamic and patient-specific MRI acquisitions, improving both efficiency and diagnostic reliability through uncertainty-aware frameworks.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HessNet, a lightweight neural network optimized for 3D brain vessel segmentation, addressing the lack of well-annotated brain MRA datasets. HessNet reduces resource needs and achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve brain vessel segmentation accuracy in MRA images, which is critical for surgical applications, and to address the scarcity of annotated public datasets for such segmentation.

Method: HessNetâa semi-supervised learning model leveraging Hessian matrices with only 6000 parametersâis developed for efficient 3D segmentation, with performance validation on a custom annotated dataset.

Result: HessNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and minimizes resource usage, enabling the creation of a new dataset with 200 semi-manually annotated brain MRA images.

Conclusion: The developed HessNet dramatically improves segmentation efficiency and accuracy, enabling better annotation workflows and providing a publicly available brain vessel dataset.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: The paper explores using adversarial random forests (ARF) to generate high-quality synthetic tabular data efficiently for epidemiology, demonstrating alignment between synthetic and real-world data analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address existing limitations in synthetic data generation methods for epidemiology, including poor quality, complexity, high computational demands, and ineffective evaluation strategies.

Method: The authors implement adversarial random forests (ARF) for generating synthetic epidemiological data and assess the method by replicating analyses from six epidemiological studies across varied variables and datasets.

Result: Synthetic data produced by ARF consistently aligned with results from original epidemiological studies, even for high-dimensional datasets with limited sample sizes. Dimensionality reduction and pre-derived variables further improved synthesis quality.

Conclusion: Adversarial random forests demonstrate strong potential as a practical and efficient solution for synthetic data generation in epidemiology, reliably replicating original research findings while benefiting from simplifications like dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study uses machine learning to classify primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) patients as slow or fast progressors by integrating optic nerve head (ONH) structure and visual field functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve glaucoma progression risk classification by combining structural and functional data, addressing limitations in using either factor alone.

Method: Patients with PACG underwent >5 reliable visual field tests and OCT scans over >5 years. The data were processed through AI-segmented ONH parameters, sector-based visual field measures, and machine learning models, including Random Forest with SHAP analysis for feature importance.

Result: 451 eyes were analyzed from 299 patients: 369 classified as slow progressors and 82 as fast progressors. The combined structural-functional Random Forest model achieved the highest AUC of 0.87. Key predictive factors were identified, such as ONH and visual field attributes.

Conclusion: Integrating structural and functional parameters enhances PACG progression risk classification, showing the significance of inferior ONH features in disease monitoring.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

### [304] [Equi-mRNA: Protein Translation Equivariant Encoding for mRNA Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15103)
*Mehdi Yazdani-Jahromi,Ali Khodabandeh Yalabadi,Ozlem Ozmen Garibay*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Equi-mRNA is a new mRNA language model explicitly encoding synonymous codon symmetries for improved biological tasks, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for mRNA coding lack the explicit ability to capture the structured relationships and symmetries inherent in synonymous codon usage.

Method: Equi-mRNA incorporates group-theoretic priors, equivalence loss, and symmetry-aware pooling to create biologically representative codon-level structures.

Result: Equi-mRNA improves accuracy by ~10% in property-prediction tasks and produces constructs ~4x more realistic and ~28% better at preserving functional properties.

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA offers a biologically principled framework for mRNA modeling, advancing synthetic biology and therapeutic design.

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

*Huixin Zhong,Yanan Liu,Qi Cao,Shijin Wang,Zijing Ye,Zimu Wang,Shiyao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper studies social conformity in large language models (LLMs) by examining their behavioral mechanisms and reactions to varying uncertainty levels in decision-making contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs exhibit human-like psychological mechanisms of social conformity under various uncertainty conditions in collaborative decision-making.

Method: The authors adapted the information cascade paradigm to quantitatively assess the influence of informational and normative factors on LLMs' decision processes in diverse scenarios, modifying uncertainty levels and monitoring behavior.

Result: Informational influence drives LLMs' behavior across all examined contexts, with accuracy and confidence increasing as evidence strengthens. However, under high uncertainty, normative-like behavior emerges, amplifying the weight given to public signals.

Conclusion: LLMs primarily rely on informational processing but exhibit normative-like behavior under high uncertainty, highlighting distinct adaptability based on uncertainty levels in collaborative environments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Conclusion: The research provides insights into interdisciplinary AI curriculum development, highlights the impact of educator participation, and serves as a guide for future curriculum designs in response to industry needs.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry
needs.

### [307] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a semantic normalization framework to improve narrative knowledge graphs by reducing inconsistencies and redundancy, applied to Manga109 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex visual narratives like comics often suffers from annotation inconsistencies and redundancy, limiting reasoning and generalization effectiveness in narrative graphs.

Method: The authors introduce a framework for semantic normalization using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering to consolidate related actions and events within hierarchical narrative graphs.

Result: Applying the normalization framework to annotated manga stories shows improved coherence, robustness for tasks like action retrieval, and event summarization while preserving symbolic transparency.

Conclusion: Semantic normalization enhances narrative graph interpretations, making them scalable and cognitively inspired for multimodal narrative understanding.

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

TL;DR: Recent advancements in neuromorphic event video research focus on improving the visualization and functionality of the ADÎER representation for better speed, flexibility, and compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in flexibility, speed, and compressibility of current event video representations in neuromorphic research.

Method: Improving the adder-viz software to enhance real-time event transcode processes and applications integration, using the unified ADÎER representation.

Result: Enhanced visualization and usability of event transcodings through updated features in the MIT-licensed adder-viz software.

Conclusion: The improvements made to the adder-viz software will advance the adoption and utility of the ADÎER representation in neuromorphic event video applications.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes
and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a

TL;DR: The paper presents AmbiSQL, an interactive system improving Text-to-SQL tasks by detecting query ambiguities and clarifying user intent via multiple-choice questions, leading to better SQL translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-experts benefit from Text-to-SQL systems, but large language models (LLMs) often generate errors due to ambiguity in queries, necessitating more robust solutions.

Method: The system employs a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy to detect ambiguities in database element mapping and LLM reasoning, and uses user feedback to rewrite unclear questions for accurate intent interpretation.

Result: AmbiSQL achieves 87.2% precision in detecting ambiguities and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50% in Text-to-SQL systems, as validated on a dedicated dataset.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL significantly enhances Text-to-SQL system performance and practicality by addressing query ambiguity through interactive clarification.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

*Manit Paul,Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla,Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to conformal prediction that addresses challenges arising from missing or censored training data, providing distribution-free valid prediction regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional conformal prediction methods assume complete training data, but this assumption is rarely met in practice due to missing or coarsened data, limiting their applicability.

Method: The authors use semiparametric theory to derive influence functions, combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. They integrate flexible machine learning techniques like random forests to handle nuisance functions in the semiparametric model.

Result: The proposed framework produces prediction intervals with enhanced coverage under covariate shift and addresses monotone missingness scenarios effectively. Simulation studies demonstrate its robustness.

Conclusion: This approach extends conformal prediction techniques to handle real-world scenarios with missing or censored data, enabling more accurate predictive inference with strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has recently received a tremendous amount of
interest, leading to a wide range of new theoretical and methodological results
for predictive inference with formal theoretical guarantees. However, the vast
majority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully
observed data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an
assumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often
missing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In
addition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to
dropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such
coarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of
well-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and
efficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of
obtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given
coarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve
our goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the
outcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened
data, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our
principled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating
flexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the
underlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward
application of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals
with stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the
construction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness
scenarios. We further illustrate the performance of our methods through various
simulation studies.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of Chinese speech data for detecting heart failure, introducing a database for research and highlighting individual differences in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in research on whether Chinese syllables contain information relevant to heart failure detection, similar to findings in other languages.

Method: The authors created a Chinese speech database of HF patients, conducted paired recordings pre-and post-hospitalization, performed statistical and classification analyses, and proposed an adaptive frequency filter (AFF).

Result: Chinese speech was found effective in detecting HF using patient-wise and personalised pair-wise classification approaches. Individual differences were identified as major contributors to classification inaccuracies.

Conclusion: The study validates Chinese language as useful for HF detection and proposes a speaker-decoupled baseline method for future studies. The database created serves as a resource for further research.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

TL;DR: The paper introduces GOAT, a post-training framework for LM-based TTS systems aiming to reduce hallucinated speech and improve performance without extensive resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the issue of hallucinated speech in LM-based TTS systems, which creates text-speech mismatches due to model uncertainty and seeks to mitigate this problem without incurring high resource costs or latency.

Method: The authors conduct uncertainty analysis, revealing the link between hallucination and uncertainty. They reformulate TTS generation into a trajectory flow optimization problem, introducing a Subtrajectory Balance objective, sharpened internal rewards, reward temperature decay, and optimized learning rates to stabilize and improve the process.

Result: The proposed GOAT framework decreases character error rates by over 50% in difficult test cases and reduces model uncertainty by up to 58%.

Conclusion: GOAT effectively mitigates hallucinations in LM-based TTS while maintaining resource efficiency and enhancing generalization, offering a promising framework for robust TTS generation.

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A neural network-enhanced solution for denoising gunshot detection on military vehicles successfully doubles detection rates under high noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing gunshot detection systems on moving military vehicles where high levels of acoustic noise reduce performance.

Method: A lightweight neural network and two-hidden-layer perceptron combined with signal processing techniques.

Result: Denoising processing doubled detection rates even when noise levels match the muzzle blast peak amplitude.

Conclusion: The system operates effectively in noisy environments with minimal hardware requirements due to the lightweight neural network architecture.

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve dynamic speech emotion recognition by focusing on sequences of emotions in audio and optimizing methods to enhance the realism of emotional 3D avatars.

Method: The approach includes training a speech emotion recognition model, generating synthetic emotional sequences, incorporating human feedback, and using a Dirichlet-based method for modeling emotional mixtures.

Result: The experimental results reveal that the Dirichlet-based method is effective for modeling emotional mixtures, and human feedback enhances model performance while simplifying annotations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a novel and effective approach for dynamic speech emotion recognition, improving emotional modeling and leveraging human feedback for optimized performance and ease of use in 3D avatar animations.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Motivation: The authors aimed to improve understanding and diagnostic ability of cough sound analysis in respiratory disease management by incorporating interpretability features.

Method: The methodology uses occlusion maps in conjunction with CNNs to highlight key spectral regions in cough spectrograms and subsequently identifies differences between disease categories through weighted spectral analysis.

Result: The approach revealed significant spectral differences in cough patterns for diseases like COPD, showcasing more pronounced variability in identified spectral regions compared to raw spectrogram analysis.

Conclusion: XAI techniques can enhance cough sound analysis by delivering interpretable results that uncover disease-specific acoustic patterns, improving diagnostic insights.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more

TL;DR: This paper addresses issues in Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) by introducing a novel audio feature with balanced equal attention to frequencies and a parameter-free feature enhancement technique, leading to improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle challenges in ASD, such as the uncertainty of anomaly locations and the presence of redundant noise in machine sound data, which hinder system effectiveness.

Method: The paper proposes the use of evenly distributed filter banks for equal-frequency attention and introduces a parameter-free feature enhancement approach leveraging pre-trained models for better knowledge transfer to ASD tasks.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improved ASD performance, as demonstrated on the DCASE 2024 Challenge dataset.

Conclusion: The methods enhance sound anomaly detection accuracy by improving feature representation and reducing redundancy, showcasing their effectiveness in real-world machine sound datasets.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

*Nan-Hong Kuo,Renata Wong*

TL;DR: The paper establishes a mathematical link between SVM kernels and quantum Green's functions, introduces a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM), and validates its use for enhanced SVM performance in physical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the unexplored relationship between SVM kernel functions and quantum propagators, specifically Green's functions, for improving predictive capabilities in physical systems.

Method: The authors show a theoretical equivalence between SVM kernels and Green's functions using operator inversion theory, highlight challenges with certain kernel types like the sigmoid kernel, and propose a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for tailored kernel design.

Result: Numerical experiments reveal that employing positive-semidefinite kernels corresponding to Green's functions improves SVM predictive accuracy on physical system tasks.

Conclusion: Aligning SVM kernels with Green's functions through the proposed KPM provides a physics-informed approach to enhance machine learning accuracy in modeling physical systems.

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a gradient-free and noise-robust quantum reservoir computing method leveraging discrete time crystal dynamics, addressing trainability and noise issues in current quantum machine learning algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum machine learning algorithms face significant challenges in training efficiency and robustness to noise.

Method: The authors propose using quantum reservoir computing, supported by discrete time crystal dynamics, to enhance memory and nonlinear capacities, which are calibrated and applied to classification tasks. Comparative advantages are shown through simulations and physical experiments.

Result: The proposed algorithm demonstrates enhanced accuracy with increasing system size, robustness to noise, and successful image classification in both simulations and experiments on quantum processors.

Conclusion: This study experimentally demonstrates quantum reservoir computing for image classification and establishes a link between non-equilibrium phase transitions and quantum learning, offering new design principles for NISQ-era quantum algorithms.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

*Al Amjad Tawfiq Isstaif,Evangelia Kalyvianaki,Richard Mortier*

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: This paper identifies significant CPU context switching overheads in densely packed workloads and proposes Linux kernel scheduler improvements to address the inefficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address inefficiencies in resource allocation and performance degradation in clusters, especially for serverless applications due to CPU context switching overheads.

Method: Researchers propose modifications to Linuxâs kernel scheduler to prioritize task completion over strict fairness and evaluate its impact on reducing cluster size while maintaining performance.

Result: The modified scheduler reduced context switching and allowed effective performance with 28% smaller cluster sizes.

Conclusion: By optimizing Linuxâs kernel scheduler, the paper showcases a practical solution to lower overheads and improve cluster efficiency without resource over-provisioning.

Abstract: Cluster orchestrators such as Kubernetes depend on accurate estimates of node
capacity and job requirements. Inaccuracies in either lead to poor placement
decisions and degraded cluster performance. In this paper, we show that in
densely packed workloads, such as serverless applications, CPU context
switching overheads can become so significant that a node's performance is
severely degraded, even when the orchestrator placement is theoretically sound.
In practice this issue is typically mitigated by over-provisioning the cluster,
leading to wasted resources.
  We show that these context switching overhead arise from both an increase in
the average cost of an individual context switch and a higher rate of context
switching, which together amplify overhead multiplicatively when managing large
numbers of concurrent cgroups, Linux's group scheduling mechanism for managing
multi-threaded colocated workloads. We propose and evaluate modifications to
the standard Linux kernel scheduler that mitigate these effects, achieving the
same effective performance with a 28% smaller cluster size. The key insight
behind our approach is to prioritise task completion over low-level per-task
fairness, enabling the scheduler to drain contended CPU run queues more rapidly
and thereby reduce time spent on context switching.

*Paula Cordero-Encinar,Andrew B. Duncan,Sebastian Reich,O. Deniz Akyildiz*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: A framework is introduced for efficient sampling from unnormalised target distributions using multiscale dynamics without training models or nested MCMC loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional score-based methods for sampling are computationally expensive or require learned approximations, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: The method uses multiscale stochastic dynamics via stochastic differential equations to estimate scores along diffusion paths, introducing two algorithms: MultALMC (multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics) and MultCDiff (multiscale controlled diffusions).

Result: Both proposed algorithms show theoretical convergence guarantees and perform competitively in empirical tests for both synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The framework offers an efficient sampling alternative that is accurate, adaptable to complex distributions, and free from the need for learned models or nested MCMC loops.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for efficient sampling from complex,
unnormalised target distributions by exploiting multiscale dynamics.
Traditional score-based sampling methods either rely on learned approximations
of the score function or involve computationally expensive nested Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) loops. In contrast, the proposed approach leverages
stochastic averaging within a slow-fast system of stochastic differential
equations (SDEs) to estimate intermediate scores along a diffusion path without
training or inner-loop MCMC. Two algorithms are developed under this framework:
MultALMC, which uses multiscale annealed Langevin dynamics, and MultCDiff,
based on multiscale controlled diffusions for the reverse-time
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Both overdamped and underdamped variants are
considered, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to the desired diffusion
path. The framework is extended to handle heavy-tailed target distributions
using Student's t-based noise models and tailored fast-process dynamics.
Empirical results across synthetic and real-world benchmarks, including
multimodal and high-dimensional distributions, demonstrate that the proposed
methods are competitive with existing samplers in terms of accuracy and
efficiency, without the need for learned models.

*Ming Li,Ruo-Sin Peng,Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper presents a U-Statistic-based random forest method, "Forest U-Test," to address challenges in detecting gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in genetic association studies with quantitative traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current genetic association studies struggle to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions due to computational challenges in handling high-dimensional data and large feature spaces.

Method: The authors developed the "Forest U-Test," a U-Statistic-based random forest approach, that uses recursive partitioning techniques to enhance the detection of genetic interactions in quantitative traits.

Result: Simulation studies demonstrated that Forest U-Test outperforms existing methods. Application to three datasets on Cannabis Dependence showed significant joint associations with robust replication across two datasets (p-values: <0.001, 5.93e-19, 4.70e-17).

Conclusion: The proposed Forest U-Test is an effective tool for detecting complex genetic interactions, addressing computational challenges and achieving strong empirical and replicated results in association studies.

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,
respectively.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics (AGP) Dataset, which links gene expression profiles with phenotypic traits for the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Aiming to improve genotype-to-phenotype analysis by providing integrated and heterogeneous datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of mapping genes to traits due to fragmented datasets lacking integration, limiting machine learning models' predictive accuracy in genomics and phenomics.

Method: The authors present a curated, multi-modal dataset (AGP) that integrates gene expression profiles with phenotypic measurements. Conventional regression benchmarks and biologically-informed hypergraph methods validate gene-trait associations.

Result: AGP Dataset enables phenotype prediction and interpretable graph learning tasks, addressing limitations in existing datasets by providing integrated gene and trait data for Arabidopsis thaliana.

Conclusion: The AGP dataset represents a significant step forward in accurately understanding genotype-to-phenotype relationships, fostering research with improved machine learning models informed by integrated biological data.

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: GenTune is a system designed to help environment designers in the entertainment industry improve collaboration with generative AI by making AI-generated prompts more understandable and enabling precise and consistent image refinements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designers face challenges with AI tools like LLMs in understanding lengthy prompts and ensuring global visual consistency during the creative process.

Method: The researchers developed GenTune, a system that links image elements to specific prompt labels, enabling designers to revise prompts for improved accuracy and consistency.

Result: In studies with 20 designers, GenTune significantly enhanced understanding, refinement quality, efficiency, and satisfaction. A follow-up field study also confirmed its real-world utility.

Conclusion: GenTune improves the integration of generative AI in design workflows by addressing issues with prompt complexity and image consistency, making AI tools more effective in professional settings.

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

Motivation: Current digital maps cannot address nuanced visual questions as they rely only on structured GIS data; a solution is needed to handle unstructured geospatial imagery.

Method: Develop Geo-Visual Agents that analyze multimodal sources like streetscapes, place-based photos, and aerial imagery alongside GIS data.

Result: Outlined a vision, sensing approaches, interaction methods, key challenges, and opportunities for Geo-Visual Agents.

Conclusion: Geo-Visual Agents could enhance map-based exploration with AI-driven analysis of diverse geospatial data, enabling visual-spatial inquiries.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn
about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS
databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address
geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our
vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and
responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing
large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g.,
Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial
imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We
define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three
exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the fragmented research landscape in EEG foundation models, where inconsistent architectures and the lack of systematic categorization hinder progress.

Method: The authors created a modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis, categorizing based on output modalities such as EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, and multimodal frameworks.

Result: The taxonomy organizes diverse research ideas and innovations while identifying challenges such as interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and practical applications.

Conclusion: This work serves as a unified framework to streamline future research and facilitate the development of scalable and interpretable EEG-based systems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks,
specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and
demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures.
Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as

TL;DR: DeCoDi is a debiasing method for text-to-image diffusion models that modifies the inference process to mitigate biases without compromising image quality or requiring extensive computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the issue of biases such as gender, ethnicity, and age in text-to-image generative models and provide a lightweight, accessible debiasing solution.

Method: Proposes DeCoDi, which adjusts the diffusion process to steer away from regions corresponding to biased concepts during inference, without altering the base architecture of diffusion models.

Result: Manual evaluation by human and automated tools (GPT4o) on generated images validates DeCoDi's effectiveness, showing promising improvement in diversity and reduced biases.

Conclusion: DeCoDi improves inclusiveness and diversity in generative images and can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, ensuring broad accessibility for practitioners.

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Earth System Models struggle to efficiently and accurately simulate the increased risks of climate extremes under various emission scenarios.

Method: The approach integrates a conditional Gaussian emulator for prediction followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning correction. This ML model is trained using nudged data to ensure robustness.

Result: The model, trained on a single warming scenario, successfully extrapolates extreme event statistics under various future climate scenarios using historical ERA5 data for validation.

Conclusion: GEN2 provides an efficient and accurate method for forecasting extreme climate scenarios, even beyond its training distributions.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

TL;DR: The paper develops a taxonomy linking LLVM's forward-edge CFI to specific memory corruption vulnerabilities to guide developers and evaluates its effectiveness against selected vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory corruption vulnerabilities are a significant software security threat, often enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code. While CFI is promising, there is a lack of practical guidance for developers to deploy it effectively in real-world software.

Method: The paper categorizes LLVM's forward-edge CFI variants to memory vulnerabilities, evaluates them against 4 representative CVEs from the Top 10 KEV list, and analyzes their successes and limitations in blocking exploitation.

Result: CFI blocked exploitation in two cases but failed in the other two, highlighting both its strengths and limitations when applied to real-world vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study provides developers with practical insights for informed CFI deployment and establishes a foundation for improving CFI's effectiveness in addressing memory corruption vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Memory corruption vulnerabilities remain one of the most severe threats to
software security. They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code
execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control
Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path,
developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to
real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's
forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering
actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in
existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one
representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and
explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other
two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support
informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the
practical use of CFI in production systems.

addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated

### [334] [Retrieval-Augmented Review Generation for Poisoning Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15252)
*Shiyi Yang,Xinshu Li,Guanglin Zhou,Chen Wang,Xiwei Xu,Liming Zhu,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAGAN, a framework designed to perform high-quality data poisoning attacks on recommender systems using fake profiles enhanced by multimodal foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where attackers create fake profiles to manipulate outcomes. Improving imperceptibility and effectiveness under resource constraints is challenging.

Method: The paper leverages the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of multimodal models, employing a demonstration retrieval algorithm and text style transfer strategy to refine attack profiles.

Result: RAGAN demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in poisoning attacks through experiments on various real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully strengthens the quality and imperceptibility of attacks, providing insights into improving the robustness of recommender systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

### [335] [MoEcho: Exploiting Side-Channel Attacks to Compromise User Privacy in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15036)
*Ruyi Ding,Tianhong Xu,Xinyi Shen,Aidong Adam Ding,Yunsi Fei*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study addresses privacy vulnerabilities in Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures used in transformer models, proposing MoEcho as a side channel attack framework to highlight the risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the potential privacy vulnerabilities in adaptive routing of MoE architectures, which leave distinctive traces exploitable by adversaries.

Method: The authors introduce four novel architectural side channels and leverage these to propose four privacy attacks on MoE-based systems.

Result: The research demonstrates privacy breaches in large language models and vision language models, emphasizing the risks of MoE's dynamic token routing.

Conclusion: The study calls for timely safeguards to protect user privacy while utilizing MoE-based architectures in scalable AI services.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

### [336] [IPIGuard: A Novel Tool Dependency Graph-Based Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15310)
*Hengyu An,Jinghuai Zhang,Tianyu Du,Chunyi Zhou,Qingming Li,Tao Lin,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a defense mechanism called IPIGuard to counteract Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks in large language model (LLM) agents by decoupling action planning from external data interaction, reducing vulnerability to malicious tool invocations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face risks when interacting with untrusted data sources since malicious instructions can manipulate their behavior, necessitating stronger security measures than existing methods.

Method: IPIGuard models task execution using a Tool Dependency Graph (TDG), separating action planning phases from data interaction to limit vulnerabilities to IPI attacks.

Result: Experiments show that IPIGuard performs effectively on the AgentDojo benchmark, balancing robustness and task execution performance.

Conclusion: IPIGuard offers a promising solution to enhance safety and robustness in LLM agents interacting in dynamic and potentially risky environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

### [337] [MCPTox: A Benchmark for Tool Poisoning Attack on Real-World MCP Servers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14925)
*Zhiqiang Wang,Yichao Gao,Yanting Wang,Suyuan Liu,Haifeng Sun,Haoran Cheng,Guanquan Shi,Haohua Du,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCPTox to evaluate LLM agents' robustness against Tool Poisoning in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem, uncovering significant vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked vulnerability of Tool Poisoning in the increasingly critical MCP ecosystem, where malicious instructions in tool metadata pose a systemic threat.

Method: The authors constructed MCPTox, a benchmark built on 45 real-world MCP servers and 353 tools. They designed three attack templates, generating 1312 malicious test cases, and tested these cases on 20 LLM agents.

Result: The analysis revealed a widespread vulnerability among LLMs to Tool Poisoning, with success rates up to 72.8%. More capable models were particularly susceptible, and refusal rates were below 3%.

Conclusion: The findings establish an empirical baseline for Tool Poisoning risks, underscore the ineffectiveness of current safety alignments, and aim to guide the development of safer AI using MCPTox.

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

*Ehssan Mousavipour,Andrey Dimanchev,Majid Ghaderi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NetSight, a framework for anomaly detection in network data that adapts to distribution shifts using pseudo-labeling and knowledge distillation, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by distribution shifts in data, which hinder existing anomaly detection systems from adapting effectively and often require costly manual labeling or clean data for adaptation.

Method: NetSight utilizes pseudo-labeling to eliminate manual intervention and employs a knowledge distillation-based strategy for adaptation to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: NetSight outperformed state-of-the-art methods in adaptation performance on three long-term network datasets, achieving up to an 11.72% improvement in F1-score.

Conclusion: NetSight is a robust and effective framework for online anomaly detection in dynamic networks, capable of adapting to data distribution shifts without reliance on manual labeling or clean data.

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

### [339] [BadFU: Backdoor Federated Learning through Adversarial Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15541)
*Bingguang Lu,Hongsheng Hu,Yuantian Miao,Shaleeza Sohail,Chaoxiang He,Shuo Wang,Xiao Chen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces "BadFU," a backdoor attack leveraging federated unlearning, that maliciously alters the global model during the unlearning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore vulnerabilities arising from integrating machine unlearning into federated learning (FL), especially regarding adversarial exploitation during unlearning.

Method: The proposal of BadFU involves training a federated model with both backdoor and camouflage samples, followed by requesting unlearning of the camouflage samples to activate the backdoor in the global model.

Result: Experiments validate that BadFU successfully compromises the global model, revealing a vulnerability in current federated unlearning practices.

Conclusion: The study highlights a significant security risk in federated unlearning and advocates for the development of more secure and robust mechanisms to prevent such attacks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces a physics-informed generative adversarial network for solving the phase retrieval problem in X-ray phase contrast imaging using a single intensity measurement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in conventional methods for phase retrieval in X-ray phase contrast imaging, such as reliance on approximations, manual tuning, and the difficulty of obtaining suitable training data for deep learning models.

Method: The paper employs a physics-informed generative adversarial network that operates without requiring paired, unpaired, or simulated training data. It reconstructs phase and absorbance information from a single intensity measurement based on Fresnel theory.

Result: The approach achieves robust and high-quality reconstructions across various imaging conditions and sample types, demonstrated through both simulated data and experimental datasets from beamline P05 at PETRA III.

Conclusion: This method broadens the application of X-ray phase contrast imaging, enabling simultaneous retrieval of phase and absorption information while avoiding limitations of traditional phase retrieval methods.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate AI as a core capability in managing the lifecycle of 6G networks, addressing challenges in design, deployment, and operation.

Method: An AI-driven air interface framework that uses compression to extract essential semantic information and adaptation to handle diverse tasks and dynamic conditions.

Result: The proposed framework showcases its potential in a case study of semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks, providing insights into its scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: The paper outlines a forward-looking vision for embedding native AI in 6G, identifying key research challenges and future directions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,
outlining key challenges and research opportunities.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper explores ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL systems for federated edge learning, focusing on convergence behavior and proposing an algorithm for resource coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently integrating sensing, communication, and computation in Air-FEEL systems for applications like machine learning-based recognition tasks.

Method: Performed theoretical analysis of convergence behavior under sensing and AirComp distortions; designed and optimized ISCC parameters and proposed a low-complexity algorithm for batch size and resource allocation.

Result: Theoretical findings show a trade-off among sensing, communication, and computation for convergence. Numerical results confirm efficiency in coordinating ISCC processes, improving learning performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that optimizing ISCC processes enhances both system efficiency and model performance in Air-FEEL systems, validated through theoretical and numerical analysis.

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JEDI-linear, a graph neural network designed for real-time FPGA deployment in HL-LHC CMS trigger systems, achieving lower latency and hardware resource consumption without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs used for jet tagging at the HL-LHC face challenges in deployment on FPGAs due to high computational complexity and irregular memory access, which conflict with the strict latency and resource constraints of hardware trigger systems.

Method: The authors design JEDI-linear, a GNN architecture that avoids explicit pairwise interactions by using shared transformations and global aggregation. They also apply fine-grained quantization-aware training, with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and distributed arithmetic for multiplier-free operations.

Result: Evaluation shows JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150x lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2x lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art solutions. It eliminates the need for DSP blocks, consumes fewer resources, and meets the latency requirements for HL-LHC CMS Level-1 triggers.

Conclusion: JEDI-linear enables scalable, resource-efficient GNN inference on FPGAs, meeting the demands of real-time environments such as HL-LHC trigger systems. The open-sourced templates aid in reproducibility and wider adoption for scientific use cases.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader

*Xingran Chen,Tyler McCormick,Bhramar Mukherjee,Zhenke Wu*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new statistical framework for valid inference using machine learning imputations under a missing-at-random (MAR) assumption, accommodating general missingness patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current methodologies that only handle missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) scenarios, ignoring more realistic missing-at-random (MAR) situations in scientific inquiries using ML predictions.

Method: The authors propose a method that involves stratifying data by missingness patterns, utilizing masking-and-imputation procedures for complete cases, and developing an estimator that aggregates pattern-specific information with proper weighting.

Result: The proposed estimator demonstrates asymptotic normality and outperforms traditional weighted complete-case analyses in terms of efficiency. Simulations validate these theoretical results.

Conclusion: The method offers practical implementation via existing software, advances efficiency in inference, and opens up opportunities for addressing general missingness under MAR. However, the paper also acknowledges practical limitations and suggests future directions for improvement.

Abstract: Pre-trained machine learning (ML) predictions have been increasingly used to
complement incomplete data to enable downstream scientific inquiries, but their
naive integration risks biased inferences. Recently, multiple methods have been
developed to provide valid inference with ML imputations regardless of
prediction quality and to enhance efficiency relative to complete-case
analyses. However, existing approaches are often limited to missing outcomes
under a missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) assumption, failing to handle
general missingness patterns under the more realistic missing-at-random (MAR)
assumption. This paper develops a novel method which delivers valid statistical
inference framework for general Z-estimation problems using ML imputations
under the MAR assumption and for general missingness patterns. The core
technical idea is to stratify observations by distinct missingness patterns and
construct an estimator by appropriately weighting and aggregating
pattern-specific information through a masking-and-imputation procedure on the
complete cases. We provide theoretical guarantees of asymptotic normality of
the proposed estimator and efficiency dominance over weighted complete-case
analyses. Practically, the method affords simple implementations by leveraging
existing weighted complete-case analysis software. Extensive simulations are
carried out to validate theoretical results. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion on practical implications, limitations, and potential future
directions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel class of prior distributions facilitating adaptive orthogonality for sequences of functions, applied particularly in Bayesian FPCA, and shows its efficacy through simulations and human mobility data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of flexible and adaptive priors for sequences of orthogonal functions in statistical models like FPCA creates a need for methods that can balance orthogonality and smoothness while learning from data.

Method: The authors develop a hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions where adaptive orthogonality constraints are imposed through hyperparameter tuning, allowing for a data-driven trade-off between exactness and smoothness.

Result: Using the proposed prior, the paper demonstrates improved estimation of orthogonal functional components and interpretable low-rank representations, supported by simulations and a real-world application on human mobility data in Tokyo.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust framework for inducing orthogonality in Bayesian FPCA, yielding superior performance and practical application advantages in statistical modeling of functional data.

Abstract: We propose a novel class of prior distributions for sequences of orthogonal
functions, which are frequently required in various statistical models such as
functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our approach constructs priors
sequentially by imposing adaptive orthogonality constraints through a
hierarchical formulation of conditionally normal distributions. The
orthogonality is controlled via hyperparameters, allowing for flexible
trade-offs between exactness and smoothness, which can be learned from the
observed data. We illustrate the properties of the proposed prior and show that
it leads to nearly orthogonal posterior estimates. The proposed prior is
employed in Bayesian FPCA, providing more interpretable principal functions and
efficient low-rank representations. Through simulation studies and analysis of
human mobility data in Tokyo, we demonstrate the superior performance of our
approach in inducing orthogonality and improving functional component
estimation.

TL;DR: This paper provides a theoretical analysis of continual ridge regression for high-dimensional linear models using random matrix theory, deriving expressions for prediction risk and exploring its influence on generalization metrics. Simulation studies validate the findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the gap in theoretical understanding of generalization performance in continual learning techniques, which are increasingly used to adapt to dynamic real-world scenarios while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The authors utilize random matrix theory to derive exact expressions for the asymptotic prediction risk in high-dimensional linear models, and characterize generalization metrics including average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.

Result: The study provides theoretical risk curves illustrating trends in generalization metrics, reveals connections between model specifications and generalization performance, and confirms findings through simulation studies.

Conclusion: This work enhances the theoretical understanding of continual learning through rigorous analysis and demonstrates how model settings influence performance, offering insights for designing better continual learning algorithms.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our

how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation

### [347] [Effect Identification and Unit Categorization in the Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity Design with Application to LED Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15692)
*Philipp Alexander Schwarz,Oliver Schacht,Sven Klaassen,Johannes Oberpriller,Martin Spindler*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper develops theoretical tools for addressing non-compliance in multi-score RDD (MRD), enhancing estimation accuracy in multi-dimensional cutoff-rules, with validation in semiconductor manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-score RDD approaches collapse multi-threshold designs into single-dimensional cases, leading to non-compliance and estimation inaccuracies in causal effect analyses.

Method: The paper refines unit behavior categorizations for multi-dimensional cutoff rules, identifies conditions for stable identification of cutoff-effects, and explores decomposing cutoff-rules to reduce non-compliance. Validation is conducted using simulations and real-world manufacturing data.

Result: The framework effectively identifies and reduces non-compliant units (e.g., nevertakers, alwaystakers), improving the estimation variance for cutoff-effects in optimization contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed framework refines production policies by improving causal effect estimates in multi-dimensional threshold settings, demonstrating its utility for practical decision-making in manufacturing.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

### [348] [Discrete VHCs for Propeller Motion of a Devil-Stick using purely Impulsive Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15040)
*Aakash Khandelwal,Ranjan Mukherjee*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper addresses a novel control problem for achieving stable vertical propeller motion of a devil-stick through impulsive forces, introducing Discrete Virtual Holonomic Constraints (DVHC) for stabilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address an unexplored problem in underactuated robotic jugglingâachieving stable propeller motion using impulsive, normal forces, which has practical applications in robotics and control systems.

Method: The authors introduce the concept of Discrete Virtual Holonomic Constraints (DVHC) to specify the center-of-mass location of the devil-stick in terms of its orientation angle during impulsive inputs. They also present a controller enforcing DVHC and an orbit-stabilizing controller using impulse-controlled PoincarÃ© maps.

Result: Conditions for stable propeller motion are derived, and the proposed approaches are validated through simulations showing their effectiveness in trajectory design and stabilization.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates the feasibility of using DVHC to achieve stable orbital stabilization and trajectory control of a devil-stick in the vertical plane using impulsive forces.

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The study compares several machine learning models for predicting hazardous near-Earth objects. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting hazardous near-Earth objects is crucial for planetary defense and safety.

Method: The study used a binary classification framework, data preprocessing techniques (scaling, power transformation), and compared six classifiers.

Result: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved outstanding accuracy (~99.7%) and high F2-scores (~0.987), outperforming other models.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods excel in precision and recall for this task, emphasizing model selection and opportunities for hyperparameter optimization in future research.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

TL;DR: HEAS is a Python framework that integrates agent-based modeling, evolutionary optimization, and tournament evaluation. It emphasizes reproducibility, modularity, and comparability in simulations across disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in achieving reproducible, modular, and standardized workflows for cross-disciplinary, multi-level modeling and optimization.

Method: HEAS uses hierarchical modeling with deterministic layered streams, evolutionary algorithms for optimization, and uniform evaluation metrics. It blends PyTorch integration and provides API/CLI tools for ease of use.

Result: The framework demonstrates flexibility and reliability in compact examples like ecological systems and decision-making scenarios, while simplifying code, enhancing comparability, and ensuring reproducible results.

Conclusion: HEAS serves as a robust foundation for multi-level, cross-disciplinary simulation needs, offering improved workflow efficiency and reliable outputs.

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning methods in quantum chemical applications require effective uncertainty quantification to optimize predictions. However, computational expense can be reduced by incorporating lower-fidelity calculations.

Method: The paper proposes a new approach that employs low-fidelity data to inform uncertainty quantification, enabling more efficient active learning in quantum chemical predictions.

Conclusion: The novel low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification method enhances accuracy and computational efficiency in quantum chemistry applications, demonstrating promise for future active learning initiatives.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important scheme in active learning
techniques, including applications in predicting quantum chemical properties.
In quantum chemical calculations, there exists the notion of a fidelity, a less
accurate computation is accessible at a cheaper computational cost. This work
proposes a novel low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification for active
learning with applications in predicting diverse quantum chemical properties
such as excitation energies and \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces.
Computational experiments are carried out in order to assess the proposed
method with results demonstrating that models trained with the novel method
outperform alternatives in terms of empirical error and number of iterations
required. The effect of the choice of fidelity is also studied to perform a
thorough benchmark.

TL;DR: This paper investigates two-dimensional many-body memory systems that resist perturbations and display diverse error-correction behaviors via rigorous proofs and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of physical systems for robust information storage over long timescales, particularly beyond the single known paradigm of Toom's rule.

Method: The authors employ a combination of rigorous theoretical proofs and machine learning approaches to systematically explore and identify new types of 2D memory systems.

Result: Identified a variety of distinct 2D many-body memory systems that perform qualitatively different error corrections and information retention mechanisms, some requiring noise to maintain stability.

Conclusion: Many-body memory systems exhibit a rich range of robust information storage methods, revealing a broader physics landscape than previously understood.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine learning method using Flow Matching to overcome MCMC limitations, enabling scalable simulation of physical systems across sizes and temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address computational scaling limitations of traditional MCMC methods in studying physical phenomena on large systems.

Method: Flow Matching framework combined with a CNN architecture to train on small-scale systems and generalize to larger systems and varied temperatures without retraining.

Result: The framework successfully generated reliable configurations for the 2D XY model, agreeing with thermodynamic observables, and captured the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables efficient simulation of many-body systems, offering computational benefits and broad applicability to classical and quantum lattice systems.

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly
revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply
object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in
semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with

TL;DR: The study presents GenSIM, a generative AI-based model that predicts sea-ice dynamics with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of representing complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic sea-ice processes in climate models while ensuring computational feasibility.

Method: A generative AI model trained on simulations from a sea-ice--ocean system, which predicts key sea-ice properties in a 12-hour window using atmospheric forcings.

Result: GenSIM matches physical observations, reproduces both short-term and long-term sea-ice features, and demonstrates emergent extrapolation capabilities.

Conclusion: Generative models, like GenSIM, exhibit the potential to generalize unseen climates and encode implicit physics, enabling accurate, efficient sea-ice forecasting.

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

### [356] [Numerical models outperform AI weather forecasts of record-breaking extremes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15724)
*Zhongwei Zhang,Erich Fischer,Jakob Zscheischler,Sebastian Engelke*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: AI models are becoming competitive in weather forecasting but struggle to reliably predict extreme weather records compared to traditional numerical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weather forecasting is critical, especially with increasing climate extremes. AI promises improvements but their reliability for extreme events needs validation.

Method: The study compared the performance of leading AI models against HRES numerical models focusing on record-breaking heat, cold, and wind events.

Result: AI models exhibited larger forecast errors and inaccuracies in frequency and intensity predictions of extreme record-breaking events.

Conclusion: AI models are currently limited in forecasting unprecedented extremes, requiring further refinement before use in critical systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.
