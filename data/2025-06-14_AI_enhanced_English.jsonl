Evaluating the system-wide\nbenefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications\nacross multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based\nplatforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM\nchips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)\nthey require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting\naccessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern\ncomputing systems.\n  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate\nend-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes\nthe main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,\nEasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by\nenabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language\n(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design\nin a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental\nchallenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically\noperate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to\nreplicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling\nthe processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel\ntechnique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior\nof the modeled system.\n  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory\nsystem design to rapidly come to fruition.

Inspired by the dual\nmemory systems of human cognition, where episodic and semantic memories work\nsynergistically to support human reasoning and decision-making, we propose\nExpeRepair, a novel LLM-based approach that continuously learns from historical\nrepair experiences through dual-channel knowledge accumulation. ExpeRepair\norganizes historical repair experiences into two complementary memories: an\nepisodic memory that stores concrete repair demonstrations, and a semantic\nmemory that encodes abstract reflective insights. At inference time, ExpeRepair\nactivates both memory systems by retrieving relevant demonstrations from\nepisodic memory and recalling high-level repair insights from semantic memory.\nIt further enhances adaptability through dynamic prompt composition,\nsynergistically integrating both memory types to replace static prompts with\ncontext-aware, experience-driven prompts.

To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware\nGaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering\nfrom sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo\nfoundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense\npoint cloud for Gaussian initialization.

To enhance point-wise appearance representation,\nwe design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,\nallowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These\nenriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two\nlightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention\nwhile maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive\nexperiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate\nthat GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective\nunlearning.

Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a\npowerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological\nrepresentation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,\nwe propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow\nrelease, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that\nenhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key\ninnovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.\nThese enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade\ntraditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological\nspace and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data\npoisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced\nadaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious\ntasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our\ncomprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and\nImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST\neffectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,\nand the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for\nrobust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against\nevolving threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper addresses the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks to adaptive backdoor attacks by introducing a defense method named TED-LaST, which improves the robustness of existing Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) techniques.", "motivation": "Existing TED-based methods for backdoor attack detection are susceptible to adaptive attack strategies that distort topological representations, making them ineffective in identifying advanced threats.", "method": "The proposed TED-LaST integrates label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis to improve TED's capability in detecting stealthy backdoor attacks.
