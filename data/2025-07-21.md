### [1] [GraphTrafficGPT: Enhancing Traffic Management Through Graph-Based AI Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13511)
*Nabil Abdelaziz Ferhat Taleb,Abdolazim Rezaei,Raj Atulkumar Patel,Mehdi Sookhak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphTrafficGPT is a novel graph-based approach for LLM-driven traffic management that reduces inefficiencies seen in current systems like TrafficGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiencies (sequential task execution, high token usage, scalability issues) in LLM-driven traffic management systems like TrafficGPT.

Method: The paper introduces GraphTrafficGPT, using a graph-based architecture where tasks and dependencies are represented as nodes and edges, enabling parallel execution and token optimization. A Brain Agent orchestrates task decomposition, dependency graph creation, and agent coordination.

Result: GraphTrafficGPT reduces token use by 50.2%, response time by 19.0%, and improves multi-query efficiency by up to 23.0% compared to TrafficGPT.

Conclusion: GraphTrafficGPT offers a scalable and efficient solution for LLM-based traffic management, making it better suited for real-world complexities compared to current architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent
traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are
hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability,
making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,
which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency
graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,
analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to
23.0% improvement in efficiency.

### [2] [PrefPalette: Personalized Preference Modeling with Latent Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13541)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Melanie Sclar,Hunter Lang,Ansong Ni,Jacqueline He,Puxin Xu,Andrew Cohen,Chan Young Park,Yulia Tsvetkov,Asli Celikyilmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PrefPalette introduces a framework to understand user preferences through decomposed attributes and community-specific values, offering better prediction accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems fail to account for the reasons behind user preferences, treating human judgment as a black box.

Method: Predictions are made using a two-step process: counterfactual attribute synthesis creates synthetic training data to isolate attributes, and attention-based modeling captures community-specific attribute weighting.

Result: Evaluation on 45 Reddit communities shows PrefPalette exceeds GPT-4o by 46.6% in prediction accuracy, while providing community-specific insights.

Conclusion: PrefPalette improves preference modeling accuracy and transparency, paving the way for trustworthy and value-aware personalized AI systems.

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

### [3] [GOFAI meets Generative AI: Development of Expert Systems by means of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13550)
*Eduardo C. Garrido-Merchán,Cristina Puente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy to address flaws in large language models (LLMs) by generating expert systems that use symbolic representations in Prolog. This ensures precision, interpretability, and reliability in sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs provide vast coherent knowledge for tasks like open-domain question answering, they suffer from issues such as hallucinations and incorrect information generation. There is a need for a more reliable and controllable approach for developing expert systems.

Method: The method involves restricting the domain and using a prompt-based extraction process to form a symbolic knowledge base in Prolog. This representation can be validated by human experts, ensuring transparency and reliability.

Result: Experiments conducted with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1 demonstrated strong accuracy and semantic coherence in the generated knowledge bases, showing improved reliability in expert systems.

Conclusion: The study proposes a hybrid model that merges the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of symbolic systems to create dependable AI for sensitive applications.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

### [4] [Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13558)
*David Poole*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses why AI should focus on modeling entities and their relations rather than just perception data like pixels and words, and why relational learning hasn't become mainstream yet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why AI has predominantly focused on modeling perceptual data (e.g., text, images) and highlight the need for modeling real-world entities and their relationships.

Method: Analyzes the current state of AI, focusing on the gaps in relational learning, and identifies barriers preventing it from becoming broadly utilized.

Result: Highlights the underutilization of relational learning despite its relevance in handling structured data like spreadsheets and databases.

Conclusion: Suggests what changes are necessary to elevate relational learning to a more prominent role in AI research and applications.

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

### [5] [BifrostRAG: Bridging Dual Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering in Construction Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13625)
*Yuxin Zhang,Xi Wang,Mo Hu,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BifrostRAG is a dual-graph system for automated compliance checking, combining linguistic and structural analysis to achieve superior accuracy in multi-hop question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in automated compliance checking due to the linguistic and structural complexity of safety regulations, where traditional retrieval-augmented generation systems struggle with multi-hop queries.

Method: The authors introduce BifrostRAG, which uses a dual-graph approach: an Entity Network Graph for linguistic relationships and a Document Navigator Graph for structural relationships. It integrates graph traversal with vector-based semantic search to enable reasoning over regulatory text.

Result: BifrostRAG achieves 92.8% precision, 85.5% recall, and 87.3% F1 score on multi-hop question datasets, outperforming current vector-only and graph-only RAG baselines.

Conclusion: BifrostRAG is a highly effective system for LLM-driven compliance checking, offering a novel dual-graph hybrid retrieval approach that can be extended to other complex technical domains.

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid
retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex
technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

### [6] [Buggy rule diagnosis for combined steps through final answer evaluation in stepwise tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13651)
*Gerben van der Hoek,Johan Jeuring,Rogier Bos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates a method to diagnose errors in students’ multi-step problem-solving by focusing on their final answers rather than intermediate inputs, achieving high alignment with teacher diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of diagnosing students' errors when they combine multiple steps in problem-solving, avoiding the complexity of analyzing numerous solution paths.

Method: The authors propose and validate an error diagnosis system based on final answers, applying it to a dataset of student steps in solving quadratic equations.

Result: The system successfully diagnosed errors in 29.4% of previously undiagnosable student steps, and its diagnoses matched expert teacher evaluations in 97% of the tested cases.

Conclusion: Using final answers for error diagnosis can effectively mitigate combinatorial complexity, providing a promising direction for intelligent tutoring systems.

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

### [7] [Combining model tracing and constraint-based modeling for multistep strategy diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13652)
*Gerben van der Hoek,Johan Jeuring,Rogier Bos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study merges model tracing with constraint-based modeling for diagnosing multistep strategies in student problem-solving, validated against teacher-coded diagnoses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to accurately diagnose student steps in multistep problem-solving scenarios.

Method: Combining model tracing and constraint-based modeling, defining constraints linked to specific strategies, and evaluating the framework using a dataset of student steps solving quadratic equations.

Result: The system successfully aligns its diagnoses with teacher coding in all analyzed student steps, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The merged approach demonstrates potential for improving multistep strategy diagnoses in educational contexts and aligning closely with expert human judgments.

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

### [8] [DailyLLM: Context-Aware Activity Log Generation Using Multi-Modal Sensors and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13737)
*Ye Tian,Xiaoyuan Ren,Zihao Wang,Onat Gungor,Xiaofan Yu,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents DailyLLM, a lightweight activity log generation and summarization system leveraging smartphones and smartwatches for accurate and semantically rich user behavior analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activity log generation systems lack accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness, prompting the need for a more advanced and precise system.

Method: DailyLLM integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions using smartphone and smartwatch sensors and employs a lightweight LLM framework with structured prompting and efficient feature extraction.

Result: DailyLLM surpasses current methods, improving BERTScore precision by 17% over a 70B-parameter baseline while being 10x faster using a 1.5B-parameter LLM model.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides a scalable, efficient, and semantically rich solution for activity log generation and demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

### [9] [OntView: What you See is What you Meant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13759)
*Carlos Bobed,Carlota Quintana,Eduardo Mena,Jorge Bobed,Fernando Bobillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntView is an open-source ontology visualization tool that provides intuitive, simplified, and dynamic graphical representations for complex ontologies, including unique features like GCI visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ontology visualization tools lack effective mechanisms for graphically representing and simplifying complex ontology structures, which hampers understanding and usability.

Method: OntView employs an intuitive interface and a 'What you see is what you meant' paradigm using a DL reasoner. It includes features like GCI visualization, ontology summarization algorithms, focus on specific TBox elements, and dynamic branch hiding/showing.

Result: OntView offers an enhanced ontology visualization experience, addressing key limitations in existing tools by simplifying the representation and maintaining semantic integrity.

Conclusion: OntView fills a critical gap in the domain of ontology visualization, enabling improved comprehension of complex ontologies and fostering broader community use through its open-source availability.

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.
OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

*Renato Ghisellini,Remo Pareschi,Marco Pedroni,Giovanni Battista Raggi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid architecture for agent-assisted strategic reasoning using heuristics, semantic activation, and composition, validated with a Meta vs. FTC case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision engines often fail to integrate conflicting heuristics effectively; this study seeks to construct a framework that fuses them into coherent, context-sensitive narratives.

Method: The approach integrates heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional synthesis, inspired by quantum cognition, and applies semantic interaction modeling and rhetorical framing.

Result: The framework was illustrated through a Meta vs. FTC case study, with validation via semantic metrics; limitations and potential extensions were also discussed.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture demonstrates promise in integrating conflicting heuristics for strategic reasoning, with room for further development in dynamic tuning and contextual adaptability.

Abstract: We present a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning,
combining heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional
synthesis. Drawing on sources ranging from classical military theory to
contemporary corporate strategy, our model activates and composes multiple
heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

### [11] [When Speed meets Accuracy: an Efficient and Effective Graph Model for Temporal Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13825)
*Haoyang Li,Yuming Xu,Yiming Li,Hanmo Liu,Darian Li,Chen Jason Zhang,Lei Chen,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAGLE introduces an efficient framework for temporal link prediction that balances short-term recency and long-term structural patterns, outperforming existing methods in time and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks face scalability and efficiency challenges due to computational overload, prompting the need for lightweight solutions.

Method: EAGLE uses a time-aware module for immediate preferences and a structure-aware module for global influence, coupled with adaptive weighting and simplified processing without multi-hop message passing.

Result: Experiments on seven real-world datasets show EAGLE delivers superior performance in accuracy and efficiency, achieving over 50x speedup versus transformer-based models.

Conclusion: EAGLE proves to be a scalable and efficient framework for temporal link prediction, combining effectiveness with computational efficiency against state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

### [12] [CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14111)
*Xiaoya Li,Xiaofei Sun,Albert Wang,Jiwei Li,Chris Shum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CUDA-L1, a reinforcement learning framework, drastically improves CUDA optimization with average speedups exceeding x17 across various GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of GPU demand due to advancements in Large Language Models necessitates efficient CUDA optimization strategies.

Method: Reinforcement learning is used for automated CUDA optimization, leveraging speedup-based reward signals without human expertise.

Result: CUDA-L1 achieves up to x17 speedup on 250 benchmarks and adapts effectively across GPU architectures, showcasing excellent portability.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can transform weak-performing models into effective CUDA optimizers, driving GPU efficiency and paving the way for automated CUDA operations.

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

*Kathrin Korte,Christian Medeiros Adriano,Sona Ghahremani,Holger Giese*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a causal knowledge transfer framework in MARL for adapting to non-stationary environments without retraining agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of transferring knowledge among agents in MARL for non-stationary environments with changing goals.

Method: Develop a framework for agents to share compact causal representations of recovery actions to circumvent obstacles in non-stationary environments, applied in a zero-shot manner using lookup queries.

Result: Agents using causal knowledge transfer bridged half the performance gap between random exploration and retrained policies, with impact varying based on environmental complexity and agents' goal heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Causal knowledge transfer can enable effective, retraining-free adaptation in MARL, supporting efficient goal achievement in dynamic environments.

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

*Mateusz Bystroński,Mikołaj Hołysz,Grzegorz Piotrowski,Nitesh V. Chawla,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of generating novel and relevant ideas using AI by proposing a model-agnostic latent-space framework for scalable creativity without relying on brittle heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant, often replicating training patterns and requiring extensive prompt engineering.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a latent-space ideation framework to navigate the embedding space for controlled creativity without the need for handcrafted rules.

Result: Preliminary results show the framework's potential for diverse applications and adaptability across domains and creative tasks.

Conclusion: The framework is presented as an effective prototype for human-AI collaboration, offering general-purpose capabilities in ideation.

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary
results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI

### [15] [Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13956)
*Yutao Jin,Haowen Xiao,Jielei Chu,Fengmao Lv,Yuxiao Li,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes ADPC, a causal intervention framework, for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease using multimodal data including MRI, fMRI, and LLM-generated textual data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease is challenging due to confounders like selection bias in multimodal data and complex inter-variable relationships, and early detection is crucial to slow progression to dementia.

Method: The authors propose the ADPC framework, which leverages a large language model to formalize clinical data and combines MRI, fMRI, and text data for classification using causal intervention to mitigate confounders.

Result: The ADPC framework delivers state-of-the-art performance in classifying cases as Cognitively Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or Alzheimer's Disease across most evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: Integrating causal reasoning with multimodal learning proves effective for advanced and reliable neurological disease diagnosis, specifically for Alzheimer's Disease.

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in reasoning about dynamic systems with fine-grained temporal and numeric resolution using ASP.

Method: Proposes a new framework combining linear-time logic of Here-and-There and constraints tailored for ASP.

Result: Developed a logical foundation enabling nonmonotonic temporal reasoning and numeric constraints within ASP.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a path for reasoning about complex, high-resolution dynamic systems under ASP.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric
resolution presents significant challenges for logic-based approaches like
Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon
a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling
complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KROMA leverages Large Language Models in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework to enhance ontology matching using efficient optimization strategies and knowledge retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ontology matching is essential for semantic interoperability, but existing systems lack adaptability and efficiency.

Method: KROMA employs a combination of context-rich LLM integration, bisimilarity-based concept matching, lightweight ontology refinement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.

Result: KROMA achieves enhanced ontology matching performance, outperforming classical systems and modern LLM-based alternatives, while maintaining low communication overhead.

Conclusion: The integration of retrieval and enrichment strategies with scalable ontology refinement demonstrates KROMA's practical benefits and effectiveness for ontology matching.

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,
yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with
limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology
matching at scale.

available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -
2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous
glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected
from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with
type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support
researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes
datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with
data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood
glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through
this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction
across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML
collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different
prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings
from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust

Method: The method integrates Large Language Models and MotionGPT for converting task descriptions into motion-aware language, validated through computer vision tools that compare AI-simulated motions with real human movements using posture estimation and motion similarity metrics.

Result: Experimental results in eight tasks demonstrated that AI-enhanced motions achieved lower error than human-created descriptions in most cases, with superior spatial accuracy, pose alignment, and temporal similarity.

Conclusion: G-AI-HMS significantly reduces errors in joint motion and temporal alignment, providing a more accurate and cost-effective solution for simulating industrial motions while maintaining posture accuracy.

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker
behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing
methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

Result: Four of the nine LLMs demonstrated superior descriptive abilities, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet excelling in generating effective summaries.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for improving decision-making in bridge maintenance by offering detailed, accurate analysis and efficient workflow integration.

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,
and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing
structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and
requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this
analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities
for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in
providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for
integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted
analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,
several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the
quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different
NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.
Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed
descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and
demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine
models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of
topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models
are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of
the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more
effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to
significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an
innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and

Conclusion: This research demonstrates that unsupervised DRC prediction enables efficient and accurate microprocessor layout analysis, offering a substantial improvement over conventional solutions.

Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and

addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC
violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any
unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then
fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for
classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing
different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design
Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual
grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed
method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector
machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy,
respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to

Motivation: Current layer assignment approaches struggle to optimize timing, power, and congestion simultaneously, especially with the increasing complexity of VLSI designs.

Method: The paper introduces GAP-LA, a GPU-accelerated framework that holistically optimizes performance-related metrics for layer assignment in global routing.

Result: GAP-LA achieves 0.3%-9.9% better WNS, 2.0%-5.4% better TNS, and competitive runtime compared to state-of-the-art methods, even on large designs with up to 12 million nets.

Conclusion: GAP-LA offers an effective and efficient solution for holistic optimization in VLSI layer assignment, balancing performance metrics and runtime.

Abstract: Layer assignment is critical for global routing of VLSI circuits. It converts
2D routing paths into 3D routing solutions by determining the proper metal
layer for each routing segments to minimize congestion and via count. As
different layers have different unit resistance and capacitance, layer
assignment also has significant impacts to timing and power. With growing
design complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging to simultaneously
optimize timing, power, and congestion efficiently. Existing studies are mostly
limited to a subset of objectives. In this paper, we propose a GPU-accelerated
performance-driven layer assignment framework, GAP-LA, for holistic
optimization the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results demonstrate
that we can achieve 0.3%-9.9% better worst negative slack (WNS) and 2.0%-5.4%
better total negative slack (TNS) while maintaining power and congestion with
competitive runtime compared with ISPD 2025 contest winners, especially on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of building effective emotion recognition models, hindered by the scarcity and complexity of diverse emotional datasets due to ethical and practical constraints.

Method: The method involves the PersonaGen framework, which builds virtual personas by integrating demographic, socio-cultural, and situational attributes to guide LLM-generated emotional text.

Result: Experimental results indicate that PersonaGen generates more diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: PersonaGen shows promise as a robust tool for enhancing or replacing real-world emotional datasets through synthetic data generation.

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAFT, a structure-aware fine-tuning method for LLMs to improve text generation from graph-structured inputs like AMRs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with tasks requiring structured input comprehension, such as AMRs in graph form. Existing solutions either discard important structural cues or are incompatible with standard LLMs.

Method: SAFT integrates graph topology into LLMs using magnetic Laplacian-based positional encodings, projected into the embedding space, without modifying the original model architecture.

Result: SAFT achieves a 3.5 BLEU score improvement on AMR-to-text generation benchmarks (AMR 3.0), with gains correlated to graph complexity.

Conclusion: SAFT bridges the gap between structured data and LLMs effectively, providing scalable benefits for tasks requiring graph-aware processing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

TL;DR: The paper addresses fake news detection using a graph-based approach, applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert news articles into contextual graph structures and utilizing graph anomaly detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing issue of fake news spreading rapidly in digital media, especially around sensitive topics like COVID-19, motivated this research.

Method: The proposed method integrates NLP to transform news articles into contextual graphs, followed by using the Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD) algorithm to identify patterns and anomalies.

Result: The approach successfully identifies normative and anomalous patterns in datasets containing real and fake news articles.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based approach proves effective for detecting fake news articles by leveraging contextual patterns that traditional methods might miss.

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The under-representation of linguistically diverse areas, such as India, in current LLM development motivated the creation of an Indian-focused language model addressing structural linguistic disparities.

Method: PARAM-1 is a decoder-only, text-only model trained on high-quality bilingual datasets (Hindi and English) with key principles like corpus allocation fairness, tokenization adapted for Indian languages, and culturally relevant evaluation frameworks.

Result: The model demonstrated competence as a general-purpose system and robustness for India-specific tasks on IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and socio-linguistic challenges.

Conclusion: Embedding linguistic diversity during pretraining establishes PARAM-1 as a benchmark for equitable foundation modeling, showcasing both general-purpose ability and India-centric utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

*Emil Häglund,Johanna Björklund*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to improve topic modeling by focusing on opinion units that carry sentiment, enhancing interpretability and aligning with business metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the insight extraction process from customer reviews by improving topic modeling and associating it with sentiment and business outcomes.

Method: The researchers restructured the topic modeling pipeline to operate on opinion units that combine relevant excerpts with sentiment scores, leveraging large language models for reliable extraction.

Result: The method achieved more coherent and interpretable topics, successfully correlated sentiment with topics, and demonstrated predictive power for star-rating outcomes.

Conclusion: Restructuring topic modeling to include opinion units leads to superior insights, clear topics, and a direct connection to business ratings and outcomes.

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and
classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating
coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment
modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

*Xuanqi Gao,Weipeng Jiang,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma,Siyi Xie,Xinyang Yin,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Babel, a system enhancing stylistic fidelity in neural machine translation (NMT) using monolingual corpora, achieving significant improvements in style preservation and semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neural machine translation achieves cross-lingual communication, maintaining stylistic nuances remains a problem. Existing solutions depend on parallel corpora for style preservation, which limits their practicality.

Method: The authors propose Babel, a framework with two major components: (1) a style detector utilizing contextual embeddings to identify stylistic disparities and (2) a diffusion-based applicator that remedies these inconsistencies. Babel operates as a post-processing unit for existing NMT systems, requiring no architectural changes or parallel data.

Result: Babel achieves 88.21% precision in identifying stylistic mismatches, improves stylistic preservation by 150%, and maintains a high semantic similarity score of 0.92 across various domains.

Conclusion: Babel successfully enhances style-aware translations for neural machine translation, allowing for improved stylistic fidelity without requiring parallel corpora, making it highly adaptable and effective in diverse applications.

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

*Cheng-Ting Chou,George Liu,Jessica Sun,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Vasu Sharma,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features to control the target language of large multilingual language models (LLMs) during inference, achieving up to 90% success while maintaining semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of deterministically controlling the generated language of LLMs, especially in zero-shot settings where traditional cues like language prompts or fine-tuning are not applicable.

Method: The method involves leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of two LLMs (Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B) to identify language-differentiating features. By modifying a single SAE feature at a specific transformer layer, language shifts are induced and analyzed for effectiveness.

Result: The technique achieved up to 90% success in shifting the target language, as evaluated through FastText language classification, while semantic fidelity was preserved according to LaBSE similarity scores. Language steering was most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and amplified by specific attention heads.

Conclusion: Sparse feature steering offers a promising, lightweight, and interpretable approach for controllable multilingual text generation in LLMs.

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

*Nur A Zarin Nishat,Andrea Coletta,Luigi Bellomarini,Kossi Amouzouvi,Jens Lehmann,Sahar Vahdati*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents ALIGNed-LLM, a method to enhance factual accuracy in language models by incorporating knowledge graph embeddings, reducing issues like hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the susceptibility of large language models to hallucinations by integrating structured and reliable knowledge from Knowledge Graphs.

Method: ALIGNed-LLM aligns entity and text embeddings using pre-trained knowledge graph embeddings (e.g., TransE) and a trainable projection layer, inspired by LLaVA's methodology.

Result: The ALIGNed-LLM approach demonstrated substantial improvement in factual accuracy and reduced hallucination across three QA benchmarks and in a financial use case for a central bank.

Conclusion: Incorporating knowledge graphs into language models through ALIGNed-LLM effectively grounds language models in factual knowledge, improving precision and reliability.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

*Liang Lin,Zhihao Xu,Xuehai Tang,Shi Liu,Biyu Zhou,Fuqing Zhu,Jizhong Han,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) regarding their tendency to trust authoritative sources, proposing the Paper Summary Attack (PSA) as a novel method to exploit these vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the overlooked vulnerability of LLMs indiscriminately trusting content from authoritative sources, which could lead to adversarial exploitation.

Method: The PSA method synthesizes adversarial prompts using structured content from LLM safety papers, strategically infilling harmful payloads within predefined sections to test vulnerabilities.

Result: PSA achieved a 97% attack success rate (ASR) on models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and 98% ASR on Deepseek-R1, showing significant vulnerabilities across various LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings not only highlight critical safety risks in LLMs but also reveal diverse vulnerability biases across different models, offering new directions for adversarial and safety alignment research.

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

### [35] [Revisiting LLM Value Probing Strategies: Are They Robust and Expressive?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13490)
*Siqi Shen,Mehar Singh,Lajanugen Logeswaran,Moontae Lee,Honglak Lee,Rada Mihalcea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates different methods for probing the values of Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their vulnerabilities and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the values of LLMs is important as it affects user interactions across demographic groups, but current probing methods lack robustness and systematic comparison.

Method: The study evaluates three popular value-probing strategies, tests their robustness to input perturbations, studies demographic responsiveness, and examines alignment with behavior in value-driven scenarios.

Result: Probing methods show large variances under perturbations, demographic context has minimal effect on generation, and the probed values only weakly correlate with real-world preferences.

Conclusion: Existing methods for probing LLM values are limited in reliability and robustness, requiring a more refined approach to accurately assess these values.

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

### [36] [Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501)
*Matilde Marcolli,Robert C. Berwick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a mathematical framework representing syntax in function space, potentially supporting neurocomputational realization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how syntactic objects can be represented mathematically and how this may relate to neurocomputational processing.

Method: The authors construct a function space representation based on wavelets, use Renyi entropy to define structures, and connect these to Merge operations via a Hopf algebra Markov chain.

Result: A faithful representation of syntactic structures in the function space was modeled, with Merge implemented through sinusoidal waves and phase synchronization.

Conclusion: Merge can be equated with the successor function of a semiring, making syntax representation computationally feasible and linked to neurocomputational theories.

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework using conversational graphs and a novel Filter & Reconnect method to improve analysis of loosely structured dialogues, achieving higher semantic clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the analysis of conversational dynamics for large language model systems, especially in loosely structured dialogues.

Method: They propose a computational framework constructing conversational graphs and introduce the Filter & Reconnect method for simplifying graphs while maintaining semantic coherence.

Result: Demonstrated a 2.06x improvement in semantic metric S and 0 δ-hyperbolicity, ensuring enhanced coherence and tree-like structure in conversational graphs.

Conclusion: The method supports better analysis of large-scale dialogue datasets and has applications in chatbot monitoring, dialogue tools, and user behavior analysis.

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study demonstrates that integrating pause features with semantic coherence metrics improves automated analysis of formal thought disorder (FTD) severity, yielding robust and scalable diagnostic tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in assessing formal thought disorder (FTD) in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Traditional methods are resource-intensive, prompting the need for scalable, automated alternatives like speech analysis using pause features and semantic coherence metrics.

Method: The study leverages automatic speech recognition (ASR) to extract pause features and semantic coherence metrics in three datasets with differing speech contexts. Support vector regression (SVR) is used to predict clinical FTD scores and evaluate model performance.

Result: Pause features alone successfully predict FTD severity, while integrating them with semantic coherence metrics boosts predictive accuracy. The combined approach achieves notable correlations (up to \u03c1 = 0.649) and high AUC values (~83.71%) for severe case detection, outperforming semantic-only models.

Conclusion: Automated analysis combining temporal (pause) and semantic features is a promising framework for improving FTD assessment. This approach enhances prediction accuracy and offers scalable solutions for psychosis evaluation.

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

Motivation: Russian speech synthesis faces unique language-specific challenges like vowel reduction, consonant devoicing, stress variability, and intonation issues.

Method: The authors created Balalaika, a 2,000-hour studio-quality Russian speech dataset with detailed annotations, to address these challenges and rigorously evaluated it against existing datasets.

Result: Models trained on Balalaika performed significantly better than those trained on previous datasets in speech synthesis and enhancement tasks.

Conclusion: Using a high-quality, extensively annotated dataset like Balalaika provides substantial improvements for Russian speech synthesis tasks, addressing language-specific complexities effectively.

Abstract: Russian speech synthesis presents distinctive challenges, including vowel
reduction, consonant devoicing, variable stress patterns, homograph ambiguity,
and unnatural intonation. This paper introduces Balalaika, a novel dataset
comprising more than 2,000 hours of studio-quality Russian speech with

Experimental results show that models trained on Balalaika significantly
outperform those trained on existing datasets in both speech synthesis and

TL;DR: The study characterizes human and machine-generated texts using linguistic features across various linguistic levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate linguistic differences between human and machine-generated texts to enable better understanding and analysis.

Method: Analyzed linguistic features like dependency length and emotionality in texts across 8 domains and 11 LLMs, applying statistical and style embedding analyses.

Result: Human texts exhibit simpler syntax, greater semantic diversity, and stylistic variation across domains compared to machine-generated texts, which are more homogenized in newer models.

Conclusion: Human-written texts show distinctive linguistic features and variability compared to machine-generated texts, highlighting stylistic diversity that persists across domains.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Motivation: Current multilingual translations by LLMs suffer from issues like stilted or unnatural translations, highlighting the need for improved multilingual handling.

Method: Seed-X trains a 7B parameter model on a multilingual dataset and applies Chain-of-Thought reasoning and reinforcement learning for better translation generalization.

Result: Seed-X performs on par with top closed-source models like Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o and surpasses larger open-source models in both metrics and human evaluations.

Conclusion: Seed-X demonstrates the feasibility of competitive open-source translation models, sharing techniques and parameters for further research and development.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations
that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a
family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual
and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of
multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and
applications.

Motivation: To address the challenges of adapting large language models for specialized domains like healthcare, especially in environments with limited labeled data, like ICUs.

Method: CU-ICU uses sparse fine-tuning via few-shot prompting and selective model parameter updates applied to the T5 architecture, focusing on minimal supervision.

Result: CU-ICU demonstrated up to a 15% improvement in sepsis detection and a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations, while updating fewer than 1% of model parameters.

Conclusion: CU-ICU provides an efficient, scalable, and low-overhead method for accurate and interpretable clinical decision support, making it suitable for real-world ICU applications.

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled

instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KiC introduces an efficient method to lower inference costs in free-form text generation by using weaker models unless stronger ones are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing dependency on expensive, high-performing models like GPT-4 to minimize API and computational costs while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Implementing a cascade framework where weaker models are evaluated for representative answers and their semantic alignment, escalating to stronger models only if necessary.

Result: KiC achieves 97.53% of GPT-4's accuracy, lowers API costs by 28.81% on average, and even surpasses GPT-4 in certain benchmarks.

Conclusion: Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC) offers a cost-efficient solution for free-form text generation, maintaining high accuracy without over-reliance on expensive models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoopServe, a framework to accelerate multi-turn dialogue processing in large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current acceleration methods for multi-turn dialogues face inefficiencies due to fixed heuristics that don't adapt to the complex patterns in real-world conversations.

Method: LoopServe uses online sparsification in the prefilling phase and progressive key-value compression during decoding, combined with a new benchmark for multi-turn dialogues.

Result: Experiments show LoopServe outperforms existing methods in efficiency and effectiveness, accelerating LLM inference in long-context dialogue tasks.

Conclusion: LoopServe provides adaptive innovations that optimize dialogue handling, overcoming limitations in existing methods and improving the responsiveness of LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

### [45] [Consistent Explainers or Unreliable Narrators? Understanding LLM-generated Group Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13705)
*Cedric Waterschoot,Nava Tintarev,Francesco Barile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Group Recommender Systems (GRS) by comparing their recommendations and explanations to traditional social choice aggregation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rising adoption of LLMs in GRS, there is a need to understand how their recommendations and explanations compare to established aggregation strategies, so as to ensure transparency, efficiency, and validity.

Method: Comparisons were made between LLM-generated recommendations/explanations and traditional social choice-based aggregation methods, examining factors such as group structure, criteria used, and scalability in group scenarios.

Result: LLM-generated recommendations were similar to Additive Utilitarian aggregation, but explanations were inconsistent, mentioning criteria like user similarity and diversity without proper definition or reliability.

Conclusion: Using LLMs in GRS pipelines holds potential but raises concerns about transparency and efficiency at larger scales due to ambiguous explanations and inefficiencies in standard methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

### [46] [The Judge Variable: Challenging Judge-Agnostic Legal Judgment Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13732)
*Guillaume Zambrano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study uses machine learning to analyze the role of individual judges in child custody cases in French appellate courts, showing that judge-specific models outperform general ones in predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to investigate whether judges significantly influence legal outcomes, challenging the traditional assumption that judges apply laws uniformly.

Method: The authors employ machine learning, with a hybrid technique combining Large Language Models (LLMs) for feature extraction and traditional ML models (RF, XGB, and SVC) for predicting child custody rulings, comparing judge-specific and judge-agnostic models.

Result: Judge-specific (specialist) models achieve significantly higher predictive accuracy, with F1 scores up to 92.85%, compared to 82.63% for judge-agnostic models, demonstrating the influence of individual decision patterns.

Conclusion: The findings support legal realism, suggesting judicial identity influences legal outcomes, and emphasize the importance of understanding judicial behavior for equity in jurisprudence.

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

### [47] [PRIDE -- Parameter-Efficient Reduction of Identity Discrimination for Equality in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13743)
*Maluna Menke,Thilo Hagendorff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to mitigate gender and sexual-identity biases in large language models (LLMs), specifically using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often perpetuate biases from their training data, marginalizing LGBTQIA+ users. Addressing and reducing these biases is critical for inclusivity and fairness.

Method: The researchers tested two PEFT techniques, LoRA and soft-prompt tuning, to mitigate bias in LLMs. They used the WinoQueer benchmark to evaluate bias and fine-tuned the models using a curated QueerNews corpus.

Result: LoRA reduced bias substantially, improving neutrality scores from near 0% to up to 36%, while soft-prompt tuning only delivered marginal improvements. LoRA required less than 0.1% additional parameters to achieve this.

Conclusion: LoRA is a highly effective, computationally efficient method for mitigating bias in LLMs. The study calls for wider adoption of PEFT, development of queer-authored corpora, and improved evaluation mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

### [48] [Innocence in the Crossfire: Roles of Skip Connections in Jailbreaking Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13761)
*Palash Nandi,Maithili Joshi,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines the vulnerabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating inappropriate content based on prompt design and presents a method to exploit these weaknesses effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the sensitivity of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to prompt design and assess the extent to which this sensitivity can lead to generating inappropriate content.

Method: The study analyzes the effect of detailed visual information, adversarial examples, and positively framed phrases on jailbreak success. It also proposes a framework with a skip-connection between internal VLM layers to enhance jailbreak effectiveness.

Result: Findings reveal that multimodal settings significantly degrade the VLM's ability to distinguish harmful inputs. Each factor independently facilitates jailbreaks, and using as few as three in-context examples can lead to inappropriate outputs. A skip-connection framework and the use of memes are shown to amplify these vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: VLMs have critical and exploitable vulnerabilities to prompt sensitivity, necessitating further research into robust and reliable safeguards for these models.

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

### [49] [An Enhanced Model-based Approach for Short Text Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13793)
*Enhao Cheng,Shoujia Zhang,Jianhua Yin,Xuemeng Song,Tian Gan,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GSDMM+, an enhanced clustering algorithm for short text data, reducing noise and improving topic discovery through entropy adjustments and cluster merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to tackle challenges in short text clustering, such as data sparsity, high dimensionality, and computational intensity, while improving on existing representation learning and topic model-based methods.

Method: They propose GSDMM+ which builds on the collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM). Their enhancements include reducing initialization noise, adaptively adjusting word weights based on entropy, and merging clusters strategically to improve clustering granularity.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that GSDMM+ outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness for short text clustering.

Conclusion: GSDMM+ achieves fine-grained and more topic-relevant clustering for short text, proving to be a strong advancement on existing clustering techniques. Its source code is made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

### [50] [Question-Answer Extraction from Scientific Articles Using Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13827)
*Hosein Azarbonyad,Zi Long Zhu,Georgios Cheirmpos,Zubair Afzal,Vikrant Yadav,Georgios Tsatsaronis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two methods for extracting key ideas from scientific articles by generating Question and Answer (QA) pairs: one using article content with a Large Language Model (LLM) and another leveraging a Knowledge Graph (KG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scholars need an efficient way to quickly identify main ideas and contributions in scientific articles for their research.

Method: Two QA generation methods are developed: (1) an article-content-based method using salient paragraphs and LLMs, and (2) a KG-based method that uses an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model and saliency metrics to structure information.

Result: The KG-based approach effectively captures the main ideas in scientific articles, and fine-tuning the ER extraction model is essential for extracting high-quality information.

Conclusion: The methods proposed, especially the KG-based approach, provide reliable tools for summarizing scientific articles' key ideas, with potential for broader applications in academic research.

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

*Lizhi Ma,Tong Zhao,Shuai Zhang,Nirui Song,Hongliang He,Anqi Li,Ran Feng,Huachuan Qiu,Jingsong Ma,Zhenzhong Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies the relationship between language use and mental health conditions in Chinese counseling sessions, finding significant ties between negative emotional word use and depression/anxiety severity, but no influence from first-person pronoun use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how linguistic expressions may serve as indicators of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling interactions, taking into account cultural and conversational specificities.

Method: Analyzed 735 online counseling sessions using LIWC software and general linear mixed-effect models to assess linguistic patterns.

Result: Found a positive correlation between the frequency of negative emotional words and severity of depression and anxiety, but no significant variation for first-person singular pronoun usage.

Conclusion: Cultural and conversational contexts have a nuanced impact on language use in mental health communications, emphasizing psycholinguistic markers specific to Chinese-speaking clients.

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

### [52] [Modeling Fair Play in Detective Stories with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13841)
*Eitan Wagner,Renana Keydar,Omri Abend*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework to assess the qualities of detective fiction, specifically focusing on the balance between coherence and surprise, termed as 'fair play.' It evaluates LLM-generated stories, finding them inconsistent in maintaining this balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and improve the quality of detective fiction through a formalized probabilistic framework, especially in the context of stories generated by large language models (LLMs).

Method: Develop a probabilistic framework for detective fiction, formally defining fair play and related metrics. Validate the framework by applying it to LLM-generated detective stories to measure coherence and surprise.

Result: The framework reveals that LLM-generated detective stories often struggle to balance the trade-off between coherence and surprise, leading to lower-quality narratives.

Conclusion: LLM-generated detective stories fail to maintain fair play effectively, underperforming in crafting high-quality narratives that balance coherence and unpredictability.

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

TL;DR: The study presents InTraVisTo, a visualization tool for understanding reasoning processes in Transformer-based LLMs, focusing on token generation and internal patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unpredictable nature and discrepancies between desired outcomes and actual behavior in LLMs pose challenges for practical deployment.

Method: Introducing InTraVisTo, a tool that visualizes a Transformer-LMM's internal states using decoded token embeddings and information flows with Sankey diagrams.

Result: InTraVisTo allows researchers to investigate token computation processes and reasoning mechanisms within Transformer models.

Conclusion: The tool aids in enhancing comprehension of LLM computations, bridging gaps between model complexity and interpretability.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

TL;DR: Paper explores label unification in cybersecurity NER across datasets, employing various models like BiLSTM and graph-based structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of using multiple cybersecurity NER datasets due to the lack of standardized labels.

Method: Conduct coarse-grained label unification, pairwise evaluations with BiLSTM models, and explore alternative architectures like multihead and graph-based transfer models.

Result: Unified dataset models underperform in cross-dataset generalization; multihead model shows marginal improvement, and graph-based transfer model doesn’t outperform BERT-base-NER.

Conclusion: Unified label models and novel architectures like graph-based transfer models fail to yield significant gains for cybersecurity NER.

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it
challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four
cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a
coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared
BERT-base-NER.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in automatic speech recognition (ASR) for Catalan-Spanish code-switching (CS) by proposing methods to improve performance using synthetic and real CS data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address the lack of dedicated code-switching datasets, which limits ASR performance in multilingual societies, especially for Catalan-Spanish CS widely used in various settings.

Method: Three methods were explored: generating synthetic CS data, concatenating monolingual audio, and leveraging real CS data with language tokens. Whisper models were fine-tuned using these datasets.

Result: The study found that combining synthetic CS data with the dominant language token produced the best transcription performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning Whisper models using both synthetic and real CS strategies enhances ASR performance, offering practical solutions for Catalan-Spanish language transcription.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Academic institutions need scalable systems to measure personal and professional skills, as trained human raters for SJTs pose operational challenges.

Method: The authors utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract construct-relevant features from SJT responses, applying this approach to the Casper SJT as a demonstration.

Result: The study demonstrates the efficacy of LLMs in improving automated scoring while addressing issues of construct validity.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a groundwork for next-generation automated systems in assessing personal and professional skills through scalable and valid metrics.

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

TL;DR: The paper explores text classification by political leaning and 'politicalness' using transformer models, addressing limitations in current siloed approaches by creating a more diverse dataset and improved benchmarking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer models struggle with out-of-distribution text in political leaning classification due to siloed and isolated datasets and approaches.

Method: The authors combined 12 datasets for political leaning classification, created a new dataset for 'politicalness,' and benchmarked model performance using leave-one-in and leave-one-out validation techniques.

Result: New models were trained, outperforming current approaches with improved generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper contributes by providing a comprehensive dataset and evaluation techniques to enhance out-of-distribution performance for political text classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: The study explores the persuasive power of 19 LLMs across political issues and finds that post-training and prompting methods significantly enhance persuasiveness while diminishing factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about conversational AI's influence on human beliefs and its potential to manipulate opinions in the political domain prompted the study.

Method: Three large-scale experiments involving 19 LLMs, assessing their persuasiveness on 707 political issues and verifying the factual accuracy of 466,769 claims.

Result: Post-training increased persuasiveness by up to 51%, and prompting methods by 27%. However, these strategies decreased the factual accuracy of AI-generated claims.

Conclusion: The persuasive capabilities of current and near-future conversational AI are contingent on specific training and prompting methods, making them more influential but less reliable in factual correctness.

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

### [60] [Exploiting Primacy Effect To Improve Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13949)
*Bianca Raimondi,Maurizio Gabbrielli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how fine-tuned LLMs exhibit primacy bias in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and proposes a method to turn this bias into a performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the role of positional biases, like primacy effect, in fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on tasks like Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA).

Method: Analyzed how fine-tuning affects primacy bias in LLMs and introduced a response-reordering technique based on semantic similarity to the query, without using the correct answer.

Result: Experimentally demonstrated that reordering answer options leveraging primacy bias significantly enhances MCQA performance.

Conclusion: Biases in LLMs, such as primacy bias, can be approached as both challenges and opportunities. The study offers meaningful insights for bias-aware NLP model design and applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

### [61] [Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13966)
*Bhishma Dedhia,Yuval Kansal,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for training language models using domain-specific bottom-up reasoning through knowledge graphs, validated in the medical domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficient abstraction acquisition in traditional top-down training of language models for domain-specific expertise.

Method: Developed a curriculum synthesis pipeline using a medical knowledge graph to generate 24,000 reasoning tasks and fine-tuned language models to acquire domain-specific reasoning.

Result: Created QwQ-Med-3, a medical superintelligent model, which outperformed state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench, showcasing enhanced reasoning and transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: This approach highlights a paradigm shift, suggesting AGI could emerge from composable domain-specific superintelligent agents rather than broad, generalized expertise.

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

### [62] [Open Automatic Speech Recognition Models for Classical and Modern Standard Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13977)
*Lilit Grigoryan,Nikolay Karpov,Enas Albasiri,Vitaly Lavrukhin,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in Arabic ASR by introducing two novel models based on FastConformer: one for MSA and the first unified model for MSA and CA, achieving SOTA performance, and open-sourcing them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic ASR faces challenges due to language complexity and lack of public models, particularly for variations like Classical Arabic.

Method: The authors propose a universal methodology for Arabic processing and train FastConformer-based models for MSA and unified MSA-CA functionalities.

Result: The MSA-focused model achieves SOTA performance for related datasets, while the unified model delivers top-tier diacritics-aware accuracy for CA and strong MSA results.

Conclusion: The paper advances Arabic ASR with benchmark-setting models, providing resources for further research through open-sourcing of models and training recipes.

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

*Haoyu He,Haozheng Luo,Yan Chen,Qi R. Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RHYTHM is a framework that enhances trajectory reasoning and prediction using hierarchical tokenization and a frozen large language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatio-temporal prediction and reasoning for human mobility using an approach that balances performance and computational efficiency.

Method: RHYTHM segments trajectories into daily tokens, incorporates hierarchical attention to capture temporal dependencies, and enriches token representation using pre-computed LLM embeddings while freezing the LLM backbone to reduce computation.

Result: Improved accuracy by 2.4%, increased weekend-specific accuracy by 5.0%, and reduced training time by 24.6% compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The combination of hierarchical token encoding and frozen LLM backbones effectively enhances reasoning capabilities and efficiency in human mobility prediction tasks.

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for
Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions
trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical
attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially
reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Jianfei Li,Kevin Kam Fung Yuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study introduces the CPC-CMS framework for selecting the best classification model for document-level sentiment analysis using pairwise comparison and weighted evaluation criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of selecting the optimal classification model for sentiment analysis through a structured and expert-informed evaluation framework.

Method: The CPC-CMS framework combines weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) via expert judgment and applies it to various algorithms such as Naive Bayes, LSTM, and ALBERT to identify the best model.

Result: The simulation results show ALBERT performs best across three datasets when time is excluded, but no single model dominates when time consumption is factored.

Conclusion: CPC-CMS is a versatile evaluation framework that can assist in classification model selection across domains by aligning model performance with weighted criteria.

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of various Large Language Models (LLMs) for biomedical tasks across text and image processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the performance and cost-efficiency of both open-source and closed-source LLMs in addressing diverse biomedical tasks.

Method: The study experimentally evaluated multiple LLMs on tasks like biomedical text classification, generation, question answering, and multimodal image processing.

Result: No single LLM consistently outperforms others on all tasks. Open-source LLMs often yield comparable or better results than closed-source models, with added advantages like faster inference and enhanced privacy.

Conclusion: Insights from this study help in choosing LLMs that are best suited for specific biomedical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and
image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on
tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question
answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate
that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

*Lautaro Estienne,Gabriel Ben Zenou,Nona Naderi,Jackie Cheung,Pablo Piantanida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents the CRSA model for multi-turn collaborative dialogs, demonstrating its effectiveness in referential and medical domain games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pragmatic reasoning frameworks like RSA struggle to handle multi-turn collaborative scenarios.

Method: The authors propose CRSA, an information-theoretic extension of RSA, which employs a gain function based on rate-distortion theory to better model multi-turn dialog.

Result: Empirical evaluations on referential games and doctor-patient dialogs showed CRSA outperformed existing baselines in producing consistent and collaborative behaviors.

Conclusion: CRSA advances the field by enabling more pragmatic, collaborative, and socially aware language agents.

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

### [67] [DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14079)
*Garapati Keerthana,Manik Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces DENSE, a system designed to generate temporally and semantically coherent progress notes for EHRs by retrieving and aligning evidence across patient visits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress notes are vital for understanding a patient’s longitudinal medical history but are underrepresented in major EHR datasets like MIMIC-III, posing challenges for healthcare analysis and decision-making.

Method: DENSE uses a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify relevant temporal and semantic content across visits, organizing them with fine-grained categorization and temporal alignment for structured input into large language models to generate progress notes.

Result: The system exhibits strong longitudinal fidelity, improving narrative coherence and achieving a temporal alignment ratio of 1.089, which surpasses continuity levels in existing documentation.

Conclusion: DENSE enhances healthcare documentation by restoring narrative coherence, enabling improved summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision-making workflows.

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

*Brian Ondov,William Xia,Kush Attal,Ishita Unde,Jerry He,Hoa Dang,Ian Soboroff,Dina Demner-Fushman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper discusses a study on adapting biomedical literature into plain language using AI models. Results showed potential but emphasized the necessity for better tools and highlighted the limitations of current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Making professional biomedical literature accessible to patients and caregivers through plain language adaptation, while ensuring accuracy and simplicity, given the potential risks in this domain.

Method: Two tasks were developed and evaluated under the PLABA track: rewriting abstracts entirely into plain language (Task 1) and identifying/replacing difficult terms (Task 2). Both tasks underwent rigorous manual and reference-based evaluation.

Result: Twelve teams from various countries showcased a range of models. Top-performing systems matched human accuracy but lacked simplicity. Systems struggled with identifying difficult terms but performed well in generating accurate and simple replacements for Task 2.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of large language models in biomedical adaptation but underscores the need for improved benchmarking tools and areas for refinement in AI systems.

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

### [69] [Open-Vocabulary Object Detection in UAV Imagery: A Review and Future Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13359)
*Yang Zhou,Junjie Li,CongYang Ou,Dawei Yan,Haokui Zhang,Xizhe Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) methods applied to UAV aerial scenes powered by cross-modal text-image alignment advancements like CLIP. It categorizes existing methodologies, datasets, challenges, and open problems while presenting future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV aerial object detection methods are limited to predefined categories, hindering their usability in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent progress in technologies like CLIP has facilitated OVOD, enabling UAVs to detect unseen objects via textual descriptions, thereby enhancing their utility.

Method: The paper systematically reviews OVOD techniques and datasets, creates a taxonomy for categorization, discusses UAV-specific challenges, and identifies open problems. It integrates principles of OVOD with UAV vision characteristics, and outlines future research paths.

Result: The survey provides a structured overview of existing OVOD methods in aerial imagery and highlights the limitations and opportunities. It establishes a taxonomy and extensively examines datasets and challenges relevant to UAV applications in OVOD.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the significance of OVOD in advancing UAV intelligence and autonomy while offering a valuable reference for researchers through a systematic survey. It proposes solutions for future progress and advocates innovation in the field.

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents EDNIG, a deep learning framework for low-light image enhancement, using illumination guidance, multi-scale context extraction, and GAN optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address quality degradation in low-light images while maintaining model efficiency.

Method: Introduced EDNIG, which combines U-Net with an illumination map derived from BCP, incorporates SPP for multi-scale features, uses Swish activation, and employs GAN optimization with a composite loss.

Result: EDNIG achieved competitive visual and quantitative performance compared to existing methods and showed lower model complexity.

Conclusion: EDNIG effectively enhances low-light images, balances performance with simplicity, and is practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

### [71] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an evaluation suite to test vision-language models' (VLMs) ability for nonlocal visual reasoning tasks, revealing significant limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs perform well on complex tasks, they struggle with simple perceptual and reasoning tasks, leading to a need to evaluate their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors define and isolate three forms of non-local vision (comparative perception, saccadic search, and smooth visual search) to test core visual reasoning abilities of flagship VLMs using a structured evaluation framework.

Result: Flagship VLMs failed to effectively handle these tasks, performing barely above random levels on tests that are trivial for humans.

Conclusion: Despite advancements in visual acuity, current VLMs lack crucial visual reasoning abilities, highlighting a gap in their development.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning, finding structured scene graph-based prompts and GRPO fine-tuning to be more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization behavior in vision-language models (VLMs), addressing limitations in reasoning accuracy and robustness under varied conditions.

Method: The authors used structured multi-stage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts based on scene graphs and employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-tuning on datasets, with performance evaluated under diverse conditions.

Result: Simple CoT prompting harmed performance but structured scene graph prompting improved accuracy. GRPO fine-tuning outperformed supervised fine-tuning under both accuracy on Pass@1 and robustness to phrasing changes.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and GRPO fine-tuning enhance spatial reasoning and generalization in VLMs, overcoming issues like overfitting and performance degradation under out-of-distribution conditions.

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

*Atharv Goel,Mehar Khurana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method that uses 2D vision-language models to enable open-vocabulary 3D object detection without requiring any human-annotated 3D labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object detection datasets typically suffer from limited class taxonomies and expensive annotation processes, which hinder scalability, especially in open-world scenarios. This paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging 2D vision-language models and their robust semantic understanding.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline where 2D vision-language detectors generate text-conditioned proposals. These are segmented and back-projected into 3D using geometry and either LiDAR or pseudo-depth. A geometric inflation strategy employing DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers is used to estimate 3D bounding boxes without training.

Result: The method demonstrates competitive localization performance in various settings, such as LiDAR-based and RGB-D inputs, and manages to maintain open-vocabulary functionality. Additionally, it performs robustly under simulated adverse conditions in the Pseudo-nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: This work showcases the scalable potential of 2D foundation models in 3D perception tasks, providing a training-free and open-vocabulary approach. The authors make their code and resources publicly available, fostering further exploration.

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new multimodal multitask network capable of processing up to 12 different data modalities, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse datasets using a novel architecture and training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of processing and learning from diverse data modalities simultaneously for complex, multimodal, and multitask scenarios.

Method: The approach combines modality-specific tokenizers, a shared transformer architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms. It introduces a new pretraining strategy with iterative modality switching and a training algorithm balancing joint and pairwise modality training.

Result: The network achieves state-of-the-art performance on 25 datasets across 12 modalities, validating its architecture, pretraining, and training strategies.

Conclusion: The novel multimodal multitask approach successfully integrates data from various modalities into a unified system, showcasing enhanced performance across diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

Conclusion: Butter provides an accurate and computationally efficient framework that refines hierarchical feature representation, making it suitable for real-time object detection in autonomous driving contexts.

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address

Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing inefficiencies of exhaustive modality searches in multimodal video retrieval systems and the need to optimize computational overhead while maintaining competitive retrieval performance.

Method: The method involves using GPT-4.1 for intelligent query routing, dynamically selecting modalities such as ASR, OCR, and visual indices based on query intent and predicted needs, to reduce redundant processing.

Result: ModaRoute achieves 60.9% Recall@5, reduces computational overhead by 41%, and requires only 1.78 modalities per query on average, compared to 3.0 for exhaustive searches.

Conclusion: The intelligent routing approach of ModaRoute enables scalable, cost-effective multimodal retrieval systems, balancing infrastructure efficiency with retrieval effectiveness, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling

Motivation: To address the increasing demands for precision and automation in defect detection while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.

Method: The authors provide a detailed survey analyzing closed-set and open-set defect detection frameworks across 2D and 3D modalities.

Result: The paper highlights the evolution of defect detection methods, emphasizing the shift towards open-set techniques that reduce dependence on extensive defect annotations.

Conclusion: By identifying critical challenges and emerging trends, the survey contributes to a better understanding of industrial defect detection's current landscape.

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

*Arjun Rao,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study augments satellite machine learning benchmarks by integrating additional geographic layers and shows improved model performance, especially in limited data and out-of-sample scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of fusing non-optical geographic data with optical satellite imagery to improve supervised learning tasks in geospatial domains.

Method: The researchers appended additional geographic data layers to satellite imagery datasets in existing benchmarking tasks and evaluated performance on classification, regression, and segmentation tasks.

Result: Fusing geographic inputs with optical imagery improved model performance, particularly in settings with limited labeled data and geographic out-of-sample scenarios. Simpler fusion strategies outperformed complex ones.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-modal geographic data enhances satellite ML models, indicating practical benefits for data efficiency and out-of-sample generalization, setting a basis for future advancements in fusion methods.

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

*Yang Zhang,Er Jin,Yanfei Dong,Yixuan Wu,Philip Torr,Ashkan Khakzar,Johannes Stegmaier,Kenji Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to safely erase specific concepts from generative models without compromising their utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliance of generative models on large-scale unlabeled data raises safety and copyright concerns, prompting efforts to erase unwanted concepts.

Method: The proposed method defines a minimalist concept erasure objective using the distributional distance of outputs and incorporates neuron masking to enhance robustness.

Result: The analysis shows that the proposed method effectively erases concepts without damaging overall model performance, demonstrated on flow-matching generative models.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a practical and robust approach for safer generative models, contributing to their responsible deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

*Chihiro Noguchi,Takaki Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of accurate 3D semantic occupancy prediction for vision-centric autonomous driving systems without relying on costly LiDAR-annotated datasets by utilizing large-scale binary occupancy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve vision-centric autonomous driving systems by making 3D semantic occupancy prediction cost-effective and feasible, using widely available binary occupancy data instead of expensive LiDAR data.

Method: The authors propose a binary occupancy-based framework that splits the process into binary and semantic occupancy modules, facilitating the use of binary occupancy data for pre-training and learning-based auto-labeling.

Result: The experimental results show that the framework outperforms existing methods in pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, improving the efficiency and accuracy of 3D semantic occupancy predictions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging large-scale binary occupancy data is an effective way to enhance 3D semantic occupancy prediction while reducing dependency on costly annotated datasets.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

TL;DR: This paper proposes InSyn, a novel Transformer-based model for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enhances accuracy in crowded scenarios by capturing specific interaction patterns and introduces SSOS for better initial-step predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pedestrian trajectory prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios by addressing the limitations of previous methods in capturing diverse interaction patterns like paired walking or conflicting behaviors.

Method: Proposed InSyn, a Transformer-based model to capture diverse interaction patterns and introduced the SSOS training strategy to reduce initial-step divergence in sequential predictions.

Result: Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets showed InSyn significantly outperformed recent baselines, especially in high-density scenarios, while SSOS reduced initial-step errors by 6.58%.

Conclusion: InSyn and the SSOS strategy contribute to improving pedestrian trajectory prediction both in terms of accuracy in crowded conditions and initial-step divergence.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Masking-Augmented Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), enhancing diffusion models for better visual editing, compositionality, and controllability through novel training and inference strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing diffusion models in grounded visual editing and compositional control, aiming to expand their capabilities.

Method: The proposed method involves Masking-Augmented Gaussian Diffusion (MAgD) for training with dual corruption processes and Pause Tokens for scaling computational ability during inference.

Result: The approach improves the editability, compositionality, and controllability of diffusion models, showcasing superior structured visual representations and editing capabilities.

Conclusion: These innovations position diffusion models closer to general-purpose generative frameworks, enhancing their utility in structured and controlled visual editing tasks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multimodal dataset for driver drowsiness detection, incorporating facial, behavioral, biometric, and driving telemetry data, collected from 19 subjects over 1400 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of comprehensive multimodal datasets available for analyzing driver drowsiness, capturing gradual changes in driver states rather than discrete labels.

Method: The authors collected 3D facial video, IR camera footage, biometric metrics like heart rate and skin temperature, grip sensor data, and telemetry data during driving simulations, with drowsiness levels self-reported every 4 minutes.

Result: A dataset was created through continuous sessions, integrating a wide range of multimodal signals over a total of 1400 minutes, with gradual state changes recorded.

Conclusion: The dataset serves as a rich resource for driver drowsiness analysis, advancing research in understanding and detecting gradual driver state changes in a simulated environment.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AortaDiff introduces a diffusion-based framework for accurately generating smooth 3D aortic meshes directly from CT/MRI, overcoming limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in constructing accurate, geometrically consistent 3D aortic surfaces for clinical and computational purposes, especially when only limited annotated data is available.

Method: AortaDiff employs a conditional diffusion model to generate aortic centerlines from medical images, extracts vessel contours, and fits them into smooth 3D meshes suitable for CFD analysis.

Result: Experimentally, AortaDiff demonstrated effective performance with limited training data, successfully constructing aorta meshes for normal and pathological cases, such as aneurysms and coarctations.

Conclusion: AortaDiff provides an end-to-end solution for generating CFD-compatible aortic meshes with high geometric fidelity, requiring minimal labeled data, making it highly practical for cardiovascular research.

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA benchmarks inadequately test VLMs' ability to perform visual entailment tasks, particularly in crowded scenes.

Method: COREVQA introduces 5608 uniquely crafted image and true/false statement pairs sourced from the CrowdHuman dataset to test visual entailment reasoning.

Result: Even top-performing VLMs score below 80% on the COREVQA benchmark, with other models ranging from 39.98%-69.95%, highlighting performance gaps.

Conclusion: VLMs show significant limitations in reasoning over complex image-statement tasks, indicating the need for improved models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI and synthetic media necessitates reliable methods to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones, addressing vulnerabilities in existing watermarking techniques.

Method: IConMark embeds meaningful semantic attributes into images during their generation process, ensuring both robustness against manipulations and human interpretability. It also proposes hybrid approaches combining IConMark with other methods (StegaStamp and TrustMark).

Result: IConMark and its hybrid versions achieve significantly better detection accuracy compared to baseline methods, with higher mean AUROC scores across various datasets.

Conclusion: IConMark offers a robust and interpretable solution for watermarking AI-generated images, outperforming traditional methods and enhancing digital authenticity.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the frequent underdiagnosis of shoulder fractures, which often go unnoticed in emergency or high-volume settings, leading to diagnostic delays.

Method: A multi-model AI system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays was developed. Architectures such as Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, and RF-DETR were used, and ensemble techniques like Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion were applied for enhanced detection.

Result: The ensemble model (NMW technique) achieved high performance metrics, including 95.5% accuracy and a strong F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming each individual model both in recall and localization precision.

Conclusion: The AI system demonstrates reliable and accurate detection of shoulder fractures and is suitable for integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. However, it is limited to rapid screening and binary fracture detection.

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such

to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

*Alessandro Pistola,Valentina Orru',Nicolo' Marchetti,Marco Roccetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method that retrains a deep learning model using CORONA satellite imagery to improve identification of archaeological sites in transformed landscapes, achieving high precision and discovering new sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of identifying archaeological sites in landscapes that have been significantly transformed over decades, leading to the destruction of many sites.

Method: The study retrained a Bing-based convolutional neural network model using CORONA grayscale satellite imagery from the 1960s, focusing on Abu Ghraib district in the Mesopotamian floodplain.

Result: The model achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) of over 85% and a detection accuracy of 90%, while also discovering four new archaeological sites that were verified in the field.

Conclusion: The retrained AI model using CORONA imagery proved effective for identifying both existing and previously unknown archaeological sites, underscoring its potential in studying transformed landscapes with diminishing archaeological evidence.

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

### [91] [Depth3DLane: Fusing Monocular 3D Lane Detection with Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13857)
*Max van den Hoven,Kishaan Jeeveswaran,Pieter Piscaer,Thijs Wensveen,Elahe Arani,Bahram Zonooz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth3DLane introduces a self-supervised dual-pathway framework for monocular 3D lane detection, eliminating the need for ground-truth depth data or expensive sensors, while adapting to scenarios without camera calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in monocular 3D lane detection caused by the absence of explicit spatial information and the limitations of relying on ground-truth depth data, expensive sensors, or pre-known camera parameters.

Method: Depth3DLane integrates a self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework combining a bird's-eye view pathway for spatial information extraction and a front-view pathway for semantic information. It employs 3D lane anchors and predicts per-frame camera parameters.

Result: Experiments on the OpenLane benchmark dataset demonstrate that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance and successfully operates in situations where camera calibration is not available.

Conclusion: Depth3DLane offers a practical solution for monocular 3D lane detection that is scalable and adaptable to real-world scenarios, removing the dependency on ground-truth depth data, costly sensors, or fixed camera calibration parameters.

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaSTFormer, a model for predicting driving intention by leveraging causal interactions and spatio-temporal dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Brain4Cars dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the safety and efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems by accurately predicting driving intentions, addressing the limitations in current methods in capturing complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and human behavior variability.

Method: The authors propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer, which includes three key components: Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) for precise temporal alignment, Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) for removing spurious correlations, and a Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) for synthesizing spatio-temporal inferences.

Result: The paper demonstrates that CaSTFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Brain4Cars dataset, effectively modeling and capturing causal spatio-temporal dependencies in driving behavior.

Conclusion: CaSTFormer improves the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction, establishing itself as a robust tool for advancing human-machine co-driving systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

TL;DR: PhyWorldBench is a new benchmark to evaluate video generation models on their adherence to real-world physics, including scenarios like object motion and energy conservation, as well as 'Anti-Physics' prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the ability of video generation models to accurately simulate physical phenomena, which remains an unresolved issue.

Method: Introduced a benchmark called PhyWorldBench covering multiple physical phenomena scenarios, along with a zero-shot evaluation method using current MLLM.

Result: Evaluated 12 state-of-the-art models across 1,050 curated prompts, identifying challenges in simulating real-world physics and deriving recommendations for improving prompt design.

Conclusion: Video generation models still face significant hurdles in maintaining physics realism, but systematic benchmarking and refined prompt design can address these issues.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

### [94] [Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Aerial and UAV Photogrammetry through Error Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13486)
*Debao Huang,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for accurately quantifying uncertainties in photogrammetric point clouds, specifically addressing the challenging Multi-View Stereo (MVS) stage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds varies with the scene and lacks a standardized method for uncertainty estimation in the MVS stage, unlike the more consistent accuracy seen in airborne LiDAR.

Method: A self-calibrating approach is proposed, leveraging reliable n-view points (n>=6) per-view to regress disparity uncertainty during the MVS stage using cues like matching cost values. The method is self-supervised and accounts for the full photogrammetry error propagation.

Result: The framework was validated on diverse airborne and UAV imagery datasets, outperforming existing methods by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Conclusion: The study provides a robust uncertainty quantification framework that adheres to the error propagation and improves the reliability of photogrammetric point clouds across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Conclusion: The approach provides a novel, unsupervised, and scalable solution for detecting stress in sugar-beets, with potential applications across datasets spanning multiple years.

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data has proven effective for agricultural
tasks due to its rich spectral and temporal nature. In this study, we tackle
the task of stress detection in sugar-beet fields using a fully unsupervised
approach. We propose a 3D convolutional autoencoder model to extract meaningful
features from Sentinel-2 image sequences, combined with
acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream
clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress
detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering
a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that accelerates and improves the conductivity mapping of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ using sparse scans, reducing acquisition time by over 11x compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the slow data acquisition speed of atomic force microscopy techniques, such as conductive AFM (C-AFM), which hinders large-scale electrical characterization in the production of 2D materials.

Method: The authors developed SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that reconstructs high-resolution conductivity maps from sparse scan data. The method was validated across various scanning modes, substrates, and experimental conditions.

Result: The SparseC-AFM model achieved over 11x faster acquisition time than traditional manual parsing of full-resolution C-AFM images. It was also able to identify critical material parameters in MoS$_2$ with comparable accuracy to traditional techniques.

Conclusion: SparseC-AFM represents a significant advancement in applying AI to 2D material characterization, making it a promising tool for transitioning from laboratory-scale research to industrial-scale production.

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to improve existing models for denoising triangular meshes by developing a more robust formulation for handling the normal vectors of meshes as manifold-valued data.

Method: The proposed method extends discrete TGV models for scalar data and introduces a tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space tailored to the manifold setting.

Result: A novel regularizer was developed and tested in mesh denoising experiments, showcasing its effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The new formulation provides a significant improvement in handling manifold-valued data for mesh denoising applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the second-order total generalized
variation (TGV) of the normal vector on an oriented, triangular mesh embedded
in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The normal vector is considered as a manifold-valued
function, taking values on the unit sphere. Our formulation extends previous
discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a
Raviart-Thomas function space. To exctend this formulation to the manifold
setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods
in mesh denoising experiments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NABLA, a new attention mechanism for video generation transformers to improve efficiency without sacrificing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full attention mechanisms in transformer-based architectures are computationally expensive for high-resolution and long-duration video tasks.

Method: NABLA employs a Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns, reducing computational effort while maintaining generative quality.

Result: Experiments show NABLA improves training and inference speed by up to 2.7x while preserving quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Conclusion: NABLA addresses efficiency challenges in video diffusion transformers and can integrate seamlessly into existing frameworks, making it a practical solution for high-resolution video generation.

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a LoRA-enhanced framework to improve synthetic replay in vision-language models by adapting the Stable Diffusion generator for task-specific nuances, achieving better balance in continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic-replay methods often fail to account for fine-grained, domain-specific semantics in downstream applications, resulting in misaligned synthetic samples and knowledge degradation during continual learning.

Method: The method injects task-specific, low-rank adapters (LoRA) into a Stable Diffusion model and employs a two-stage, confidence-based sample selection approach for finetuning and synthetic sample generation to improve replay fidelity.

Result: The proposed method outperforms prior synthetic-replay techniques on the MTIL benchmark by better balancing plasticity, stability, and zero-shot capability.

Conclusion: LoRA-based generator adaptation significantly enhances continual learning in vision-language models by addressing the limitations of existing replay methods, thus improving knowledge retention and task adaptation.

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Motivation: Accurately reconstructing implicit surfaces from noisy point clouds collected with low-quality scanners remains a challenging task, requiring methods to handle substantial noise.

Method: The approach introduces NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, which applies the Noise2Noise framework to 3D neural fields. It minimizes MSE loss between noisy SDFs to denoise and refine the surface reconstruction.

Result: The method outperformed on several benchmarks like ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in improving surface reconstruction quality from noisy data.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF effectively denoises SDF representations, showcasing a practical solution for achieving accurate reconstructions from noisy point cloud data.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel diffusion model-based framework for unsupervised image deblurring using spatially varying texture priors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty of acquiring paired blurry-sharp images for training motivates the need for a practical deblurring solution using unpaired data, particularly for handling real-world complex blur patterns.

Method: The authors propose a diffusion model framework incorporating a Texture Prior Encoder for supervised texture recovery, a Texture Transfer Transformer for adaptive blurring removal, and a wavelet-based adversarial loss for preserving high-frequency textures.

Result: Their method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques on widely-used benchmarks, effectively recovering textures and handling temporal blurs.

Conclusion: The presented framework offers an effective unsupervised solution to image deblurring, leveraging texture priors and novel network components to outperform existing methods in terms of performance and texture preservation.

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses blurry outputs in burst super-resolution images by using an enhanced diffusion model, improving sharpness and fidelity while significantly reducing computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods for burst super-resolution often yield blurry images, which are perceptually inferior, motivating the need for sharp and high-fidelity SR reconstructions.

Method: The approach uses a diffusion model improved with a stochastic sampler employing a high-order ODE and implements one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation.

Result: Their method achieves runtime reduced to 1.6% of the baseline while preserving both image distortion and perceptual quality in the super-resolution outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed technique enhances efficiency and effectiveness in burst super-resolution using diffusion models, delivering clear, high-quality images faster than existing methods.

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoTasks, a framework for improving video large language models (VideoLLMs) by embedding structured chain-of-thought reasoning tasks in the input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fine-grained object-level video understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning in VideoLLMs, beyond high-level video-text pairs.

Method: CoTasks decomposes complex video questions into four foundational tasks—frame localization, entity tracking, and spatial/temporal relation extraction—and embeds these reasoning steps into the input.

Result: Using CoTasks, models like LLaVA-video-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-3B experience significant improvements on the NeXT-QA benchmark across various reasoning categories.

Conclusion: CoTasks is an effective structured supervision framework for enhancing compositional video reasoning abilities in VideoLLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

*Masahiro Ogawa,Qi An,Atsushi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the separation of moving and static objects from a moving camera using a novel method called FoELS, which integrates optical flow and texture information for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to accurately discern moving objects in dynamic environments for applications such as 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and robotics due to limitations in traditional optical flow approaches.

Method: The proposed FoELS method computes the focus of expansion from optical flow, derives motion likelihood from outliers, and combines this with segmentation-based priors to estimate the moving probability.

Result: FoELS effectively handles complex scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance as validated on both DAVIS 2016 dataset and real-world traffic datasets.

Conclusion: By integrating optical flow with texture-based analysis, FoELS provides an efficient solution to the challenges of detecting moving objects in structured and dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

### [105] [EPSilon: Efficient Point Sampling for Lightening of Hybrid-based 3D Avatar Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13648)
*Seungjun Moon,Sangjoon Yu,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPSilon introduces an efficient hybrid-based 3D avatar generation method using novel point sampling strategies, improving both speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and computational costs in generating animatable human avatars with NeRF-based hybrid models.

Method: Proposing EPSilon, which employs Empty Ray Omission (ERO) to remove unnecessary rays and Empty Interval Omission (EIO) to refine sampling intervals, reducing computational costs significantly.

Result: EPSilon achieves high computational efficiency, maintaining quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points, with inference 20 times faster and training 4 times faster.

Conclusion: EPSilon demonstrates that effective sampling techniques can substantially improve the speed and efficiency of human avatar generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

### [106] [When Person Re-Identification Meets Event Camera: A Benchmark Dataset and An Attribute-guided Re-Identification Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13659)
*Xiao Wang,Qian Zhu,Shujuan Wu,Bo Jiang,Shiliang Zhang,Yaowei Wang,Yonghong Tian,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the limitations of small-scale event camera datasets in person re-identification (ReID) by introducing a large-scale dataset called EvReID and proposing a Pedestrian Attribute-Guided Contrastive Learning framework named TriPro-ReID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current person ReID methods using event cameras lack large-scale datasets and generalization capabilities, which limits real-world application and performance evaluation.

Method: The authors introduce EvReID, a large-scale RGB-event dataset, and propose TriPro-ReID, a learning framework that integrates RGB frames, event streams, and pedestrian attribute features to improve ReID performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on EvReID and MARS datasets show improved ReID performance and validate the proposed framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: EvReID and TriPro-ReID provide a solid foundation for advancing RGB-event person ReID research by addressing data scarcity and enhancing feature learning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.
The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on

### [107] [Global Modeling Matters: A Fast, Lightweight and Effective Baseline for Efficient Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13663)
*Xingyu Jiang,Ning Gao,Hongkun Dou,Xiuhui Zhang,Xiaoqing Zhong,Yue Deng,Hongjue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet), combining wavelet decomposition and Fourier transforms for efficient and high-quality image restoration in adverse weather conditions, surpassing existing methods in performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the degradation of natural image quality caused by adverse weather, which impairs downstream tasks, and to overcome the challenges of high computational complexity in current transformer-based image restoration methods.

Method: PW-FNet introduces a pyramid wavelet-based multi-scale decomposition at the inter-block level and uses Fourier transforms at the intra-block level to reduce complexity while maintaining global modeling capability, departing from traditional self-attention mechanisms.

Result: PW-FNet achieves superior restoration performance across various tasks like deraining, dehazing, and super-resolution. It reduces parameter size, computational cost, and inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PW-FNet sets a new benchmark for efficient and effective image restoration, emphasizing the potential of wavelet and Fourier processing while balancing quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

### [108] [MaskHOI: Robust 3D Hand-Object Interaction Estimation via Masked Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13673)
*Yuechen Xie,Haobo Jiang,Jian Yang,Yigong Zhang,Jin Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MaskHOI, a Masked Autoencoder-based pretraining framework for more accurate 3D hand and object pose estimation from monocular RGB input. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of geometric ambiguity and mutual occlusion in monocular RGB-based hand-object interaction pose estimation tasks.

Method: The method involves a Masked Autoencoder-driven approach leveraging geometric-aware and occlusion-robust representation learning. Key techniques include Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation to improve learning balance and Masked Signed Distance Field-driven multimodal learning to enhance global geometric structure perception.

Result: The proposed framework demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MaskHOI effectively uses masking strategies and multimodal mechanisms to improve 3D hand-object interaction pose estimation, addressing longstanding issues in RGB-based methods.

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Chuheng Wei,Ziye Qin,Walter Zimmer,Guoyuan Wu,Matthew J. Barth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HeCoFuse, a novel framework for cooperative perception in heterogeneous V2X sensor systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in managing diverse sensor setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in feature fusion and perception reliability in V2X systems with mixed sensor setups due to cost constraints and deployment variability.

Method: HeCoFuse incorporates a hierarchical fusion mechanism with adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention, spatial resolution adjustments, and a cooperative learning strategy for dynamic modality-based fusion.

Result: HeCoFuse outperforms the CoopDet3D baseline on the TUMTraf-V2X dataset, achieving 43.22% 3D mAP in full sensor setups and robust results across nine configurations.

Conclusion: HeCoFuse establishes state-of-the-art performance in cooperative V2X perception, managing diverse sensor configurations effectively and robustly.

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

### [110] [Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13693)
*Hongyi Liu,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method for sub-pixel-level accuracy in vision-based structural health monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve vision-based motion measurement methods, addressing issues of insufficient accuracy and the need for extensive manual parameter tuning.

Method: The paper proposes using Gaussian kernel tracking, supplemented by motion consistency and super-resolution constraints, to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Result: The proposed method achieves high accuracy across various test samples without needing customized parameter setups.

Conclusion: The presented method offers a robust, accurate, and user-friendly solution for motion measurement in structural health monitoring.

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

### [111] [GOSPA and T-GOSPA quasi-metrics for evaluation of multi-object tracking algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13706)
*Ángel F. García-Fernández,Jinhao Gu,Lennart Svensson,Yuxuan Xia,Jan Krejčí,Oliver Kost,Ondřej Straka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study proposes two quasi-metrics extending GOSPA metrics to evaluate multi-object tracking based on discrepancy measures, offering flexible penalty costs and asymmetric localization costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for multi-object tracking performance assessment, such as GOSPA-based metrics, lack flexibility in penalizing false and missed objects differently or asymmetric localization cost adjustments.

Method: Two quasi-metrics are developed: an extended GOSPA quasi-metric to measure object discrepancies and a T-GOSPA quasi-metric for trajectory discrepancies. These quasi-metrics are defined to allow varied penalty costs and asymmetric localization measures, enhancing evaluation adaptability.

Result: Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the T-GOSPA quasi-metric in assessing performance for several Bayesian MOT algorithms, illustrating its applicability for nuanced evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed quasi-metrics address limitations in current MOT evaluation tools by introducing flexible penalization and asymmetric localization components, making them valuable for certain application-specific MOT assessments.

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

*Sofia Jamil,Bollampalli Areen Reddy,Raghvendra Kumar,Sriparna Saha,Koustava Goswami,K. J. Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a training-free framework called PoemTale Diffusion for better converting poetic language into images by refining prompts and adapting diffusion model mechanisms, evaluated via a newly introduced P4I dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle to interpret complex or abstract language forms, such as poetic verses, which limit their creative applications.

Method: The authors propose PoemTale Diffusion, a training-free approach that uses a multi-stage prompt refinement loop, modifies self-attention in diffusion models to ensure consistent image generation, and utilizes the newly created P4I dataset.

Result: The method showed both quantitative and qualitative success in enhancing image generation from poetic texts, validated by human experts and evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach enhances the interpretability and representational fidelity of poetic text-to-image conversions, contributing a valuable tool and dataset for further research in the field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Conclusion: The solution is effective and robust, offering museums a valuable tool to elevate visitor experiences through AR-based interactive digital content.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative augmented reality pipeline tailored for
museum environments, aimed at recognizing artworks and generating accurate 3D
models from single images. By integrating two complementary pre-trained depth
estimation models, i.e., GLPN for capturing global scene structure and
Depth-Anything for detailed local reconstruction, the proposed approach
produces optimized depth maps that effectively represent complex artistic
features. These maps are then converted into high-quality point clouds and

leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures and advanced computer
vision techniques to overcome challenges posed by irregular contours and

*Julia Laubmann,Johannes Reschke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper examines StyleGAN's generator to better understand its methods for creating realistic synthetic faces. Key topics include architectural elements, weight pruning, and manipulation of latent vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to analyze StyleGAN's generator to understand the workings of AI-generated images, which present both technological opportunities and ethical risks.

Method: StyleGAN was trained in PyTorch, enabling the inspection and pruning of weights for computational efficiency. Latent vectors were studied to observe their global and targeted influence on generated images.

Result: The latent vectors significantly affect the output, with global changes altering color tones and targeted changes manipulating specific facial features. Weight pruning results in reduced computational load without drastic output changes.

Conclusion: While the technical insights into StyleGAN are valuable, the paper underscores ethical concerns about identity fabrication and the misuse of generative technology for cybercrime.

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-FSCIL, a technique for few-shot class-incremental learning that uses a frozen text-to-image diffusion model, achieving superior results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of few-shot class-incremental learning, including limited data, catastrophic forgetting, and learning new information effectively.

Method: The approach uses a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone and extracts diverse diffusion features for latent replay alongside minimal feature distillation.

Result: Diffusion-FSCIL demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 datasets, maintaining previous knowledge and adapting to new classes.

Conclusion: The use of a frozen diffusion model backbone along with complementary features and minimal trainable components effectively addresses FSCIL challenges.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EVS, a training-free text-to-video model that combines diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models and T2V backbones for enhanced video quality and motion smoothness, addressing challenges like flickering and artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in achieving both high video quality and smooth motion representation in text-to-video synthesis models without introducing frame inconsistencies such as flickering and artifacts.

Method: The EVS method composes pre-trained T2I and T2V models: T2I models are used to refine low-quality frames via noising and denoising, and T2V backbones ensure consistent motion dynamics. This fusion encapsulates T2V temporal priors into T2I processes.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that EVS significantly improves video fidelity and motion quality over previous methods, with an inference speedup of 1.6x-4.5x.

Conclusion: EVS effectively combines the strengths of T2I and T2V models, offering high-quality and smooth-motion video generation with faster inference times. Its implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

*Mingyang Yu,Zhijian Wu,Dingjiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) and Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to enhance hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based HSI reconstruction methods struggle with capturing high-frequency details accurately. The paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The authors propose using a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) learned via a diffusion model, along with a Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) for dynamic guidance during HSI reconstruction.

Result: Experimental evaluations on MST and BISRNet show that the proposed method improves reconstruction performance by 0.5 dB compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The incorporation of SDP and SPIM enhances the recovery of details in HSI reconstruction, demonstrating significant performance improvement.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the

*Abhijit Sen,Giridas Maiti,Bikram K. Parida,Bhanu P. Mishra,Mahima Arya,Denys I. Bondar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel entropy-based feature extraction method for image classification, combining Permutation Entropy (PE), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Local Binary Patterns (LBP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative to deep learning models, which often require significant computational resources and lack interpretability.

Method: The method involves extending Permutation Entropy (PE) to 2D images, extracting features across multiple scales and orientations, and integrating these features with HOG and LBP. These handcrafted features are trained with Support Vector Machines (SVM) optimized via grid search.

Result: The approach achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets such as Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, without relying on deep learning architectures.

Conclusion: Fusion of entropy-based features with HOG and LBP provides a compact, effective, and interpretable solution for image classification, serving as an alternative to computationally expensive and less interpretable deep models.

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

*Pu Jian,Donglei Yu,Wen Yang,Shuo Ren,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ClearVQA, a benchmark addressing ambiguities in visual question answering (VQA) by focusing on interactive user clarification, rather than solely on rephrasing questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based VQA systems struggle with ambiguous user questions due to differences in user expression habits. Current methods fail to consider the value of interactive feedback in resolving ambiguities.

Method: The authors propose ClearVQA, a benchmark designed to assess VLMs' abilities to resolve VQA ambiguities through interactive clarification. It targets three common categories of ambiguity across various VQA scenarios.

Result: ClearVQA provides a standardized way to evaluate how well VLMs interact with users to understand ambiguous queries.

Conclusion: ClearVQA addresses the limitations in existing VQA approaches by emphasizing interactive clarification, paving the way for more user-centric and effective VLM applications.

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a differentiable clustering module explicitly enforcing the clustering assumption, enhancing end-to-end training for SSL and UDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SSL and UDA by explicitly enforcing the clustering assumption using a differentiable clustering mechanism.

Method: The approach involves integrating an explicit differentiable clustering module extended to use supervised data for centroid computation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method performs well in low supervision regimes and complements existing models as a regularizer.

Conclusion: The proposed technique is effective in boosting SSL and UDA, especially under limited supervision, and can enhance existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces LoFNO, a novel 3D architecture to improve resolution and accuracy of aneurysm hemodynamic analysis from clinical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low spatiotemporal resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio in magnetic resonance flow imaging limit its use in diagnosing aneurysms and predicting rupture.

Method: The study develops LoFNO, which combines geometric priors, Laplacian eigenvectors, and a deep super-resolution network for enhanced flow data processing.

Result: LoFNO achieves superior velocity and wall shear stress (WSS) predictions compared to traditional methods, offering improved cerebrovascular diagnostics.

Conclusion: LoFNO advances aneurysm diagnosis by accurately enhancing spatial and temporal resolution and predicting WSS directly from clinical imaging data.

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

*Huu-Phu Do,Yu-Wei Chen,Yi-Cheng Liao,Chi-Wei Hsiao,Han-Yang Wang,Wei-Chen Chiu,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DynFaceRestore, a novel technique for blind face restoration, addressing challenges in balancing fidelity and detail preservation using dynamic adjustments during diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the performance of blind face restoration, which struggles with balancing identity fidelity and detail preservation, especially under non-uniform degradation assumptions.

Method: It proposes a dynamic system using blurry image mapping, Gaussian kernel extraction, and localized guidance adjustments during diffusion sampling to balance fidelity and detail generation.

Result: DynFaceRestore achieved state-of-the-art results in both quantitative and qualitative tests, showcasing robust blind face restoration capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, offering a refined balance between fidelity and quality through adaptive modeling and control mechanisms.

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel framework for 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) using pseudo-future frame prediction for better handling of occlusions and limited camera fields of view.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular SSC methods struggle with occlusions and the limited field of view in real-world traffic scenarios during autonomous driving.

Method: The method uses pseudo-future frame prediction and geometrically-consistent fusion of past, present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. A 3D-aware architecture is employed to model spatial-temporal relationships.

Result: CF-SSC achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360, improving occlusion reasoning and 3D scene completion accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed temporal SSC framework expands perceptual capabilities and sets a new standard for handling occlusions and improving scene completion in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAM-MAMBA enhances IoT multimodal fusion for efficient perception. It employs linear-complexity processing, optimized modality alignment, and adaptive strategies for missing sensor data. Tests show substantial accuracy gains while minimally training parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoT multimodal fusion systems face deployment struggles due to high complexity, weak inter-modal alignment, and vulnerability to missing data.

Method: The proposed GRAM-MAMBA combines linear complexity models for time-series handling, GRAM matrix-based inter-modal alignment, and LoRA-inspired adaptive low-rank layers to manage missing modalities.

Result: Experiments showed improved performance metrics: a 24.5% boost in SPAWC2021 dataset and 93.55% F1 score on USC-HAD dataset, by training fewer than 0.3% of model parameters.

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA provides efficient, robust multimodal perception, addressing complexity and missing-data issues in IoT environments effectively.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkySense V2 introduces a multi-modal remote sensing model that uses a single transformer backbone and novel pre-training strategies to address inefficiencies in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address redundancy and inefficiency caused by separate backbone models per modality in current remote sensing tasks and inadequacy of general self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for RS data.

Method: SkySense V2 employs a single transformer backbone with an adaptive patch merging module, learnable modality prompt tokens, a novel SSL approach tailored to remote-sensing data, and incorporates a mixture of experts (MoE) module.

Result: SkySense V2 showed significant improvements, outperforming its predecessor by an average of 1.8 points across 16 datasets and 7 tasks.

Conclusion: SkySense V2 unifies multi-modal processing for remote sensing, demonstrating superior generalization and efficiency over existing methods.

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline to automate the generation of high-quality triplets for image editing assistants, introduces a novel dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results using fine-tuned generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the scarcity of pixel-accurate annotated datasets for training generative image editing models, a process hindered by the lack of automated tools to validate edit quality at scale.

Method: The authors introduce an automated pipeline that uses generative models and a task-tuned Gemini validator to mine high-quality image-inscription-edited image triplets. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping further amplify the dataset.

Result: The pipeline produces NHR-Edit, an open dataset of 358k triplets. Cross-dataset evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing datasets and showcases the performance of Bagel-NHR-Edit, a fine-tuned model achieving state-of-the-art metrics.

Conclusion: The approach eliminates manual labeling effort, democratizes access to high-quality generative training data, and advances the state-of-the-art in natural language image editing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that
enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for
future Video-LMM development.

Motivation: Fine-grained spatial control in subject-driven image customization remains elusive, blocking broader real-world applications. There's a lack of scalable datasets binding identity with spatial cues.

Method: The authors propose PositionIC, including a data synthesis pipeline using bidirectional generation to reduce subject drift, and a positional modulation layer for spatial embedding decoupling.

Result: Experiments show that PositionIC achieves precise spatial control and identity consistency, while ensuring high visual fidelity in multi-subject image customization.

Conclusion: PositionIC provides controllable, high-fidelity image customization in multi-entity contexts, opening avenues for extensive applications and further research.

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in

TL;DR: The paper examines how vision-language models address conflicts between internal and external knowledge using a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries, and identifies mechanisms for resolving such conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vision-language models manage interactions between their internal knowledge and external inputs, particularly when contradictions arise.

Method: Developed a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries and analyzed model mechanisms using logit inspection, focusing on specific heads controlling cross-modal conflict resolution.

Result: Identified key heads controlling conflict resolution, modified these to bias the model towards internal knowledge or external inputs, and showcased their ability to locate image regions driving responses.

Conclusion: Local inspection and targeted modification of vision-language model heads can enhance understanding and control of their resolution of cross-modal knowledge conflicts, revealing finer insights into decision-making processes.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Result: Experimental results show superior localization and association accuracy in real-world maritime settings compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a significant improvement in marine vision by robustly fusing visual data with chart information for dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in

TL;DR: This paper presents PCR-GS, an advanced COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting method, to enhance 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation under challenging camera motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with scenes having complex camera movements, leading to difficulties in pose estimation and joint optimization.

Method: PCR-GS introduces two regularization techniques: feature reprojection regularization aligning semantic information using DINO features, and wavelet-based frequency regularization optimizing rotation matrices in camera poses.

Result: PCR-GS demonstrates superior performance in 3D scene modeling and pose estimation, especially with complex camera trajectories, through extensive experiments on real-world scenes.

Conclusion: PCR-GS effectively overcomes the limitations of COLMAP-free 3D-GS in handling drastic camera motion, enabling more robust and high-quality 3D scene reconstructions.

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Motivation: To address the limitations of raw LiDAR point features, such as weak discriminative capabilities.

Method: The method fuses depth priors from DepthAnything with LiDAR attributes, involving a point-wise feature extraction module and a Dual-Path RoI framework with a bidirectional gated fusion module.

Result: Experiments on the KITTI benchmark show improved detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating visual foundation model priors with LiDAR data enhances expressiveness and detection performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

*Hsiang-Hui Hung,Huu-Phu Do,Yung-Hui Li,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF proposes a neural rendering approach capable of synthesizing novel views at arbitrary times and angles, even with limited input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene modeling techniques are limited in temporal aspects and rely on expensive multi-view inputs, leaving gaps in creating immersive environments for applications like the metaverse.

Method: TimeNeRF integrates multi-view stereo, neural radiance fields, and disentanglement strategies to create a generalizable radiance field and model temporal changes.

Result: The approach enables realistic rendering of novel 3D views that transition seamlessly across time periods, all without needing scene-specific optimization.

Conclusion: TimeNeRF represents a significant advancement in the field by addressing temporal 3D scene changes and improving efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications like immersive metaverse experiences.

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

### [135] [DiViD: Disentangled Video Diffusion for Static-Dynamic Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13934)
*Marzieh Gheisari,Auguste Genovesio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiViD, a video diffusion framework for disentangling static appearance and dynamic motion in video. It improves upon existing methods in accuracy, fidelity, and reduces cross-leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video is challenging, as existing methods suffer from information leakage and blurry reconstructions.

Method: DiViD uses a sequence encoder to separate static and dynamic tokens, a conditional DDPM decoder with inductive biases for consistency and compression, and an orthogonality regularizer to reduce leakage.

Result: DiViD achieves high swap-based accuracy, preserves static fidelity, enhances dynamic transfer, and minimizes static-dynamic cross-leakage, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DiViD is an effective solution to disentangle static and dynamic aspects in videos, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the correlation between vision model perceptual abilities and forecasting performance, utilizing a novel framework based on latent diffusion models for temporally grounded video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to enhance forecasting abilities of general-purpose systems by leveraging correlations between vision model perceptual skills and short-term generalist forecasting performance.

Method: A novel framework is used, which trains latent diffusion models to forecast future features in frozen representation space, decoded via lightweight task-specific readouts.

Result: The framework successfully evaluates various models and tasks using distributional metrics, showing improvements in forecasting performance through the integration of representation learning and generative modeling.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that linking representation learning with generative modeling improves forecasting in video understanding across diverse levels of abstraction.

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CSD-VAR, a method for disentangling content and style from a single image using Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR), offering improved content and style separation for creative visual synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability to separate content and style from a single image, enabling flexible creative applications in recontextualization and stylization, with a focus on utilizing the emerging potential of Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR).

Method: The authors introduce a method called CSD-VAR, which includes three innovations: a scale-aware alternating optimization strategy for better scale-level representation alignment, an SVD-based rectification to reduce content leakage into style representations, and an Augmented Key-Value (K-V) memory to enhance content identity preservation.

Result: CSD-VAR outperforms previous methods in the content-style decomposition task, delivering superior content preservation and fidelity of stylization, as shown through experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed CSD-VAR method demonstrates the potential of VAR for generative tasks, particularly in separating content and style effectively, paving the way for advanced creative applications.

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control in generating 3D scenes from natural language, which has broad applications in entertainment and design.

Method: DreamScene starts with a scene planning module using GPT-4 for object semantics and spatial arrangements, followed by a graph-based placement strategy. It uses Formation Pattern Sampling for geometry synthesis and employs a progressive camera sampling strategy for consistency. It also supports detailed scene editing features.

Result: Experiments show that DreamScene outperforms previous methods in creating consistent, high-quality, and flexible 3D scenes.

Conclusion: DreamScene provides a practical, superior solution for open-domain 3D content creation with broad editing and application capabilities.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of tunnel crack classification and segmentation for assessing tunnel safety.

Method: The proposed method uses DenseNet-169 for tunnel image classification and DeepLabV3+ for crack segmentation, with visual explanations to unravel the model's internal logic.

Result: The method achieved classification accuracy of 92.23%, FPS of 39.80, IoU of 57.01%, and F1 score of 67.44%, outperforming other CNN and Transformer-based models.

Conclusion: The two-step method with integrated visual explanations provides a fast and accurate solution for assessing tunnel health and understanding deep learning model behavior.

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise manipulation of emotions in visual content remains difficult due to their abstract nature and varied contextual representations. Bridging these aspects is crucial for creative industries.

Method: The paper introduces three components: MoodArchive (an annotated image dataset), MoodifyCLIP (a fine-tuned vision-language model), and Moodifier (a training-free editing model leveraging MoodifyCLIP and multimodal language models).

Result: The Moodifier system was tested across domains, achieving superior performance in emotional accuracy and content preservation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By integrating data, modeling, and editing, the approach connects abstract emotions with specific visual transformations, paving the way for more effective emotional content creation and offering tools for public accessibility.

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: Current EIT image reconstruction methods face challenges due to the ill-posed inverse problem, and deep learning approaches often involve heavy computational costs due to numerous parameters.

Result: QuantEIT achieves superior reconstruction accuracy and robustness with only 0.2% of conventional model parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness on simulated and real-world lung imaging data.

Conclusion: QuantEIT successfully integrates quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction, offering a lightweight, efficient, and unsupervised solution with minimal parameters and improved performance.

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTR, a training-free token reduction framework to improve the efficiency of Vision Mamba, a model competing with Vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Token reduction techniques are effective in Vision Transformers but have not been explored adequately in Vision Mamba, which lacks attention mechanisms for importance measurement.

Method: The authors propose a Mamba structure-aware importance score to rank token importance and utilize this to create MTR, a training-free framework for token reduction.

Result: Extensive experiments indicate a substantial computational workload reduction using MTR, with minimal performance loss across tasks and models.

Conclusion: MTR is an effective, training-free token reduction framework that can integrate easily with Vision Mamba models to achieve significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming methods like regularization, replay, and architecture-based models. Prototype variants also showed competitive results.

Conclusion: Frozen FMs showcase strong potential for continual learning in dermatology and their broader adoption in medical applications is encouraged.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLA-Mark, a new watermarking framework for vision-language models that ensures intellectual property protection without disrupting multimodal alignment. It outperforms existing methods in semantic preservation, detection accuracy, and attack resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text watermarking methods struggle with maintaining both semantic fidelity and visual-textual alignment, leaving critical concepts vulnerable.

Method: The authors propose a vision-aligned framework (VLA-Mark) that integrates multiscale alignment metrics and an entropy-sensitive mechanism to dynamically balance watermark strength and semantic fidelity without requiring model retraining.

Result: Experimental results show VLA-Mark achieves a 7.4% lower perplexity (PPL) and 26.6% higher BLEU score compared to traditional methods. It also excels with a 98.8% detection AUC and demonstrates 96.1% resilience to various attacks, including paraphrasing and synonym substitution.

Conclusion: VLA-Mark sets new standards for quality-preserving and robust watermarking in multimodal systems, ensuring effective watermark embedding while retaining text-visual consistency.

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study analyzes the impact of four anonymization techniques on anomaly detection performance using the UCF-Crime dataset and various detection methods, finding algorithm-specific sensitivities and trade-offs between privacy preservation and detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address urgent privacy concerns in surveillance video anomaly detection, as sensitive human data is collected for deep learning applications.

Method: The paper employs four human anonymization techniques—blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement—and evaluates their effects on four anomaly detection methods: MGFN, UR-DMU, BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD using the UCF-Crime dataset.

Result: Experimental findings reveal that anomaly detection remains feasible under anonymized conditions, with some methods performing better with certain anonymization strategies, highlighting algorithm-specific sensitivities.

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining anomaly detection performance, and the study provides a benchmark for balancing these demands.

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

*Šimon Kubov,Simon Klíčník,Jakub Dandár,Zdeněk Straka,Karolína Kvaková,Daniel Kvak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates an AI-based software for automated Cobb angle measurement, achieving metrics comparable to expert radiologists and indicating its clinical potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address scoliosis diagnosis challenges by using AI to reduce manual workloads and inter-observer variability in Cobb angle measurements.

Method: A retrospective study was conducted across ten hospitals with 103 spine radiographs, comparing AI-generated measurements to those by expert radiologists using statistical methods like MAE, RMSE, and Cohen kappa.

Result: The AI demonstrated high accuracy with MAEs around 3.9 degrees, Pearson correlation above 0.880, and moderate Cohen kappa agreement for severity grading, validating expert-level performance.

Conclusion: The AI software shows promise for improving efficiency and accuracy in scoliosis diagnosis, supporting its integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

### [149] [C-DOG: Training-Free Multi-View Multi-Object Association in Dense Scenes Without Visual Feature via Connected δ-Overlap Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14095)
*Yung-Hong Sun,Ting-Hung Lin,Jiangang Chen,Hongrui Jiang,Yu Hen Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-DOG, a framework for multi-view multi-object association in 3D reconstruction that uses graph modeling and epipolar geometry rather than visual features for robustness under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view multi-object association struggle under challenging scenarios, such as visually indistinguishable objects or noisy data. The paper aims to solve this gap by developing a robust and scalable alternative.

Method: The framework, called C-DOG, models associations with connected delta-overlap graphs and uses epipolar geometry, along with clustering and filtering techniques like IQR-based filtering and 3D back-projection error criteria.

Result: Experiments on synthetic benchmarks show that C-DOG outperforms baseline methods, remaining reliable even under high object density, noise, and limited camera overlap.

Conclusion: C-DOG enables scalable and robust 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios, eliminating the reliance on visual features and ensuring consistency in challenging multi-view settings.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Franca is a fully open-source vision foundation model that outperforms proprietary models while addressing clustering and positional bias limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a transparent, high-performance, and open-source vision foundation model, addressing limitations in state-of-the-art clustering methods and positional biases.

Method: Franca applies a nested multi-head clustering projector for fine-grained feature refinement and positional disentanglement strategy to remove positional biases.

Result: Franca achieves consistent improvements on downstream benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Franca sets a new standard for open, transparent, and reproducible vision foundation models, advancing the AI community's ability to create generalizable models.

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

### [151] [Checkmate: Zero-Overhead Model Checkpointing via Network Gradient Replication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13522)
*Ankit Bhardwaj,Weiyang Wang,Jeremy Carin,Adam Belay,Manya Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Checkmate is a system for per-iteration checkpointing in DNN training that eliminates training slowdowns by leveraging gradients from data-parallel training to maintain checkpoints in a shadow cluster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiencies and tradeoffs in traditional DNN training checkpointing, which pauses training and balances between checkpointing frequency and recovery cost.

Method: Introduces a multicast abstraction to simultaneously deliver gradients to a shadow cluster, which applies them to a model copy to maintain checkpoints without halting training.

Result: Achieves 5 to 34.5x more frequent checkpointing, reducing repeated work by 80% to 97.1% per failure, and boosts training throughput by 1.3x to 6.5x compared to other systems.

Conclusion: Checkmate offers a significant improvement in DNN training checkpointing, enabling more frequent and efficient recovery mechanisms without compromising training throughput.

Abstract: This paper presents Checkmate, a system that enables per-iteration
checkpointing in DNN training without any training slowdown. The traditional
approach to checkpointing requires a pause in training to copy model states to
a separate location, allowing the state to be restored in the event of failure.
This approach fundamentally has a tradeoff between the frequency of checkpoints
and the cost of a failure. We avoid this tradeoff; our key insight is that in
data-parallel training, all information necessary to create a checkpoint
already exists in the network as gradients. Our core contribution is a new
multicast abstraction that simultaneously delivers gradients to a separate
CPU-based shadow cluster. The shadow maintains a checkpoint by applying those
gradients to a copy of the model. Our evaluation shows that Checkmate performs
per-iteration checkpointing with training throughput comparable to an ideal
no-checkpoint baseline. Checkmate achieves 5 to 34.5x more frequent
checkpointing compared to state-of-the-art checkpointing systems, resulting in
80% to 97.1% reduction in repeated work per failure. At the same checkpointing
frequency, Checkmate delivers 1.3x to 6.5x throughput compared to other
systems.

*Jorge Villarrubia,Luis Costero,Francisco D. Igual,Katzalin Olcoz*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new task scheduling algorithm (FAR) for Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, achieving substantial performance improvements through dynamic GPU reconfiguration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to exploit the untapped potential of NVIDIA MIG technology for optimizing multi-task execution via dynamic GPU partitioning to minimize makespan under MIG constraints.

Method: The authors introduce FAR, a 3-phase offline algorithm combining classical task moldability, a novel heuristic for partitioning tasks, and local search mechanisms to optimize task scheduling for MIG technology.

Result: FAR achieves an approximation factor of 2 on NVIDIA A100/H100 models and shows experimental results outperforming state-of-the-art methods, achieving makespans no worse than 1.22x optimum for benchmarks and 1.10x for synthetic inputs.

Conclusion: The research highlights the effective utilization of MIG through dynamic reconfigurations, achieving better scheduling results and encouraging further exploration in MIG-related technologies and methodologies.

Abstract: NVIDIA MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) allows partitioning a physical GPU into
multiple logical instances with fully-isolated resources, which can be
dynamically reconfigured. This work highlights the untapped potential of MIG
through moldable task scheduling with dynamic reconfigurations. Specifically,
we propose a makespan minimization problem for multi-task execution under MIG
constraints. Our profiling shows that assuming monotonicity in task work with
respect to resources is not viable, as is usual in multicore scheduling.
Relying on a state-of-the-art proposal that does not require such an
assumption, we present FAR, a 3-phase algorithm to solve the problem. Phase 1
of FAR builds on a classical task moldability method, phase 2 combines Longest
Processing Time First and List Scheduling with a novel repartitioning tree
heuristic tailored to MIG constraints, and phase 3 employs local search via
task moves and swaps. FAR schedules tasks in batches offline, concatenating
their schedules on the fly in an improved way that favors resource reuse.
Excluding reconfiguration costs, the List Scheduling proof shows an
approximation factor of 7/4 on the NVIDIA A30 model. We adapt the technique to
the particular constraints of an NVIDIA A100/H100 to obtain an approximation
factor of 2. Including the reconfiguration cost, our real-world experiments
reveal a makespan with respect to the optimum no worse than 1.22x for a
well-known suite of benchmarks, and 1.10x for synthetic inputs inspired by real
kernels. We obtain good experimental results for each batch of tasks, but also
in the concatenation of batches, with large improvements over the
state-of-the-art and proposals without GPU reconfiguration. Beyond the
algorithm, the paper demonstrates the research potential of the MIG technology
and suggests useful metrics, workload characterizations and evaluation
techniques for future work in this field.

*Zhixin Wang,Tianyi Zhou,Liming Liu,Ao Li,Jiarui Hu,Dian Yang,Jinlong Hou,Siyuan Feng,Yuan Cheng,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces DistFlow, a fully distributed RL framework that eliminates the centralized controller, achieving near-linear scalability and up to 7x throughput improvement over SOTA frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for large-scale RL suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to minor load imbalances in hybrid-controller architectures.

Method: DistFlow employs a multi-controller paradigm where data transfer and execution tasks are distributed across all workers, eliminating centralized nodes and decoupling resource configuration from execution logic.

Result: Extensive experiments show linear scalability and a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement compared to SOTA frameworks.

Conclusion: DistFlow resolves scalability limitations in reinforcement learning, achieving dramatic efficiency and flexibility for algorithmic experimentation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the pivotal post-training technique
for large language model. Effectively scaling reinforcement learning is now the
key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities and ensuring safe,
goal-aligned behavior in the most powerful LLMs. Mainstream frameworks usually
employ a hybrid-controller architecture where a single-controller dispatches
the overall execution logic and manages overall data transfer and the
multi-controller executes distributed computation. For large-scale
reinforcement learning, minor load imbalances can introduce significant
bottlenecks, ultimately constraining the scalability of the system. To address
this limitation, we introduce DistFlow, a novel, fully distributed RL framework
designed to break scaling barrier. We adopt a multi-controller paradigm that
dispatches data transfer and execution tasks to all workers, which eliminates
the centralized node. This allows each worker to operate independently, leading
to near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency
gains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from
execution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering
significant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic
experimentation. Extensive experiments show that DistFlow achieves excellent
linear scalability and up to a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement over
state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitations of cloud-centric AI, such as high latency, bandwidth issues, and privacy concerns, by bringing intelligent computation directly to edge devices using neuromorphic principles.

Method: The study systematically categorizes EdgeSNN foundations, including neuron models, learning algorithms, and hardware, alongside discussing practical considerations such as on-device inference, resource-aware training, and privacy-preserving mechanisms.

Result: The paper identifies challenges in evaluating EdgeSNNs on traditional hardware and proposes a dual-track benchmarking strategy for fair assessment and optimization.

Conclusion: This survey bridges the gap between biological brain-inspired learning and practical edge computing deployment, offering a foundational reference for ongoing and future research in EdgeSNNs.

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred
growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on
resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require
significant computational resources and centralized data management, the
resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed
critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing,
particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by
emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven
computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence
based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges
of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a
systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models,
learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative
practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference
using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under
non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues.
Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on
conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to
support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study,
we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge
deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and
future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first

*Derek Leung,Nickolai Zeldovich,Frans Kaashoek*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Shipwright provides a verification framework enabling the formal validation of liveness and correctness for decentralized systems, specifically executable implementations of PBFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liveness in decentralized systems like PBFT is critical to maintain forward progress despite malicious participants and without centralized control for suspensions. Existing approaches have not been able to verify liveness for PBFT effectively.

Method: Shipwright introduces modular sub-protocol and sub-proof decomposition, formal reasoning techniques for systems with malicious participants, and sound approaches for cryptographic signature validation.

Result: An initial prototype of PBFT log agreement was verified and implemented in Go with Shipwright, demonstrating its liveness and operation in normal and failure scenarios.

Conclusion: Shipwright represents a significant step forward in formally proving liveness and correctness for decentralized systems, particularly PBFT, with modularity and cryptographic reasoning.

Abstract: Ensuring liveness in a decentralized system, such as PBFT, is critical,
because there may not be any single administrator that can restart the system
if it encounters a liveness bug. At the same time, liveness is challenging to
achieve because any single participant could be malicious, and yet the overall
system must make forward progress. While verification is a promising approach
for ensuring the absence of bugs, no prior work has been able to verify
liveness for an executable implementation of PBFT.
  Shipwright is a verification framework for proving correctness and liveness
of distributed systems where some participants might be malicious. Shipwright
introduces three techniques that enable formal reasoning about decentralized
settings with malicious participants, allow developers to decompose their
system and proof in a modular fashion into sub-protocols and sub-proofs, and
support sound reasoning about cryptographic signatures that may be embedded in
messages. We used Shipwright to implement and verify an initial prototype of
agreement on a single log entry in PBFT (with a few limitations) and translate
it to an executable implementation in Go. We experimentally demonstrate its
operation and liveness both in the common case and in several failure
scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a physical model to better understand the transformer architecture used in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the physical principles behind the success of transformer models in NLP.

Method: The paper constructs physical models employing concepts from quantum mechanics, specifically using Fock and Hilbert spaces, to interpret transformers as open quantum systems.

Result: The proposed physical models provide insight into the underlying principles of transformers in large language models.

Conclusion: The study bridges theoretical gaps in the understanding of transformers by grounding them in physical quantum systems.

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the misalignment of T2I models with diverse human experiences and values, fostering an AI system that understands and adapts to pluralistic perspectives.

Method: The researchers developed the DIVE dataset, a multimodal resource with intersectional human rater feedback on safety perceptions for T2I prompts, and examined demographic influence on harm perception.

Result: The study found significant demographic-based differences in harm perception, emphasizing the need for pluralistic alignment in AI and highlighting shortcomings in conventional evaluations.

Conclusion: The work lays the groundwork for more equitable T2I systems by introducing tools, strategies, and approaches for integrating diverse human perspectives, though the content may include sensitive material.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

*Jakub Strawa,Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the use of copula theory-based CDF normalization to enhance data processing in machine learning applications, specifically targeting Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most machine learning methods normalize data through standard processes like subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation or rescaling to [0,1]. However, these approaches might lead to overfitting or overly complex models. Copula theory's CDF normalization is underexplored in machine learning and possibly offers superior simplicity and performance.

Method: The authors propose switching from traditional rescaling to CDF normalization using cumulative distribution function transformations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). They demonstrate its advantages specifically on Legendre-KAN.

Result: Replacing rescaling with CDF normalization improves prediction accuracy in Legendre-KAN models. Moreover, HCR interpretations enable neuron weights to act as mixed moments, allowing local joint distribution modeling, better probability distribution propagation, and dynamic directional changes.

Conclusion: CDF normalization simplifies representations and enhances machine learning frameworks like KANs, showcasing better prediction performance and enriched probabilistic interpretations.

Abstract: Data normalization is crucial in machine learning, usually performed by
subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, or by rescaling to a
fixed range. In copula theory, popular in finance, there is used normalization
to approximately quantiles by transforming x to CDF(x) with estimated CDF
(cumulative distribution function) to nearly uniform distribution in [0,1],
allowing for simpler representations which are less likely to overfit. It seems
nearly unknown in machine learning, therefore, we would like to present some
its advantages on example of recently popular Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs), improving predictions from Legendre-KAN by just switching rescaling to
CDF normalization. Additionally, in HCR interpretation, weights of such neurons
are mixed moments providing local joint distribution models, allow to propagate
also probability distributions, and change propagation direction.

TL;DR: The study presents 'selective embedding,' a data-loading strategy for deep learning that merges data from multiple sources in one channel, enhancing model generalization, reducing overfitting, and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of deep learning's sensitivity to input data, especially in nonstationary conditions and across varied domains, particularly in time-domain data.

Method: Selective embedding alternates short data segments from multiple sources within a single input channel, inspired by cognitive psychology.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates consistent high classification accuracy across six time-domain datasets, reduced training times, and improved adaptability in diverse domains.

Conclusion: Selective embedding offers a scalable, efficient solution for improving deep learning performance, particularly in domains requiring robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to
automatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on
manual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to
input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions
and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data.
Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies
either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study
introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates
short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel.
Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics
human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance
generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted
using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method
consistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning
architectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves
particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering
a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in
healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness
and adaptability are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the empirical advantages of Pareto-based multi-objective optimization techniques over scalarized alternatives in molecular optimization.

Method: The study uses a controlled experimental setup with identical Gaussian Process surrogates and molecular representations to compare EHVI (Pareto-based) and EI (scalarized baseline).

Result: EHVI outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity across three molecular optimization tasks.

advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a
simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) --
against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement
(EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process
surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization
tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front
coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization
encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our
results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in
low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical
advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization,
especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.

### [164] [FedSkipTwin: Digital-Twin-Guided Client Skipping for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13624)
*Daniel Commey,Kamel Abbad,Garth V. Crosby,Lyes Khoukhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes FedSkipTwin, a technique using digital twin models to predict which clients can skip communication rounds in federated learning, reducing bandwidth use while improving model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the communication overhead faced in federated learning, particularly for mobile and IoT devices with limited bandwidth.

Method: FedSkipTwin uses lightweight server-side LSTM digital twins to predict gradient norm magnitude and uncertainty, enabling selective communication rounds with clients.

Result: FedSkipTwin decreased communication overhead by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while boosting model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points using UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets.

Conclusion: FedSkipTwin is a practical and effective method for reducing communication costs and improving accuracy in bandwidth-constrained federated learning environments.

Abstract: Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning
(FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with
constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel
client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins.
Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical
sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic
uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions,
requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold;
otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth.
Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients
under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin
reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously
improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the
standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided
skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in
bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

*Jiaxiang Yi,Bernardo P. Ferreira,Miguel A. Bessa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized data-driven method that combines history-dependent multi-fidelity data and disentangles epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a versatile methodology that addresses challenges in data-driven learning, particularly to work with multi-fidelity data under uncertainty and improve predictions in complex scenarios.

Method: The authors propose hierarchical adaptations ranging from single-fidelity deterministic neural networks to multi-fidelity Bayesian recurrent neural networks for variance estimation.

Result: The method is applied successfully to various constitutive modeling scenarios, accurately predicting responses, quantifying model errors, and discovering noise distributions where present.

Conclusion: This approach opens possibilities for tackling real-world applications in scientific and engineering areas, especially under uncertainty-driven conditions.

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent
multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling
it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical
and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest
single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity
variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and
generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to
different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple
fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method
accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also
discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for
future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains;
especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under
uncertainty.

*Jianhong Chen,Meng Zhao,Mostafa Reisi Gahrooei,Xubo Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework (CaRTeD) that combines temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition to analyze high-dimensional, irregular tensor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of analyzing high-dimensional data with varying lengths and irregular formats, specifically for extracting meaningful clusters and causal information.

Method: The authors propose CaRTeD, a framework that integrates temporal causal representation with irregular tensor decomposition, offering theoretical guarantees and flexibility for downstream tasks.

Result: CaRTeD outperformed state-of-the-art methods in experiments using synthetic data and real-world electronic health records (MIMIC-III), especially in tasks such as phenotyping and network recovery.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the explainability of causal representations, provides theoretical guarantees for tensor decomposition, and opens pathways for better downstream task modeling in high-dimensional irregular data.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering
complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as
low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are
high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of
irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is
critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.
In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the
transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set
of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that
integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor
decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks
using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and
extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design
to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm
converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor
decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic
health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both
phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability
of causal representations.

*Armel Soubeiga,Thomas Guyet,Violaine Antoine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Soft-ECM," a new clustering algorithm capable of handling complex data types, including mixed and non-tabular data like time series, overcoming the limitations of traditional belief function-based clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the inability of existing belief function-based clustering algorithms to handle complex data types like mixed numerical and categorical data or non-tabular formats such as time series.

Method: The authors reformulated the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem and proposed Soft-ECM, an algorithm that positions centroids using a semi-metric, thus enabling it to handle imprecise clusters effectively.

Result: Soft-ECM achieves comparable performance to traditional fuzzy clustering methods on numerical data, while demonstrating superior ability to manage mixed data and leveraging semi-metrics such as DTW for time series.

Conclusion: Soft-ECM extends the framework of belief function-based clustering to complex data types, validating its effectiveness and expanding its practical applicability.

Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in
the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent
uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be
applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or
non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general,
not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use
of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of
barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem
for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which
consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a
semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to
conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate
its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy
clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

*Edward Henderson,Dewi Gould,Richard Everson,George De Ath,Nick Pepper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that predicts air traffic control task demand, offering interpretable results linked to specific aircraft in static traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the increasing complexity of air traffic control due to crowded airspace, aiming to improve existing metrics that fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond simple aircraft counts.

Method: An interpretable attention-based GNN is used to predict air traffic controller instructions by analyzing static traffic situations. Aircraft-specific task demand scores are derived by systematically removing aircraft and observing the model's prediction changes.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and established baselines in accurately estimating scenario complexity, making it a robust tool for task demand assessment.

Conclusion: This approach provides a reliable method to assess air traffic control task demand and understand scenario complexity, with potential applications in controller training and airspace redesign.

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand
is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing
complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond
simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts
the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by
ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive
an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating
aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework
significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable
estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool
can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse
and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller
training and airspace redesign.

*Seyyed Saeid Cheshmi,Buyao Lyu,Thomas Lisko,Rajesh Rajamani,Robert A. McGovern,Yogatheesan Varatharajah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to improve Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable inertial sensors, achieving better generalization on out-of-distribution data, including for Parkinson's patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of generalizability in existing HAR models that rely on application-specific labels and fail in new environments or populations.

Method: The authors designed a cross-modal self-supervised pretraining technique using large-scale unlabeled data combining IMU and video inputs, improving feature learning across diverse distributions.

Result: The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art IMU-video and IMU-only pretraining approaches, especially in zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on diverse datasets, including Parkinson's disease patient data.

Conclusion: Cross-modal pretraining is shown to enhance generalizability in dynamic data modalities like IMU signals, making it a promising tool for HAR and related applications. Code for implementation is publicly available.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

*Thomas Banker,Ali Mesbah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper examines the advantages of model-based agents for reinforcement learning (RL), highlighting their safety, efficiency, and interpretability compared to traditional model-free RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations like sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited interpretability associated with model-free reinforcement learning that relies heavily on neural networks.

Method: Presenting model-based agents that incorporate adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and constraints. This approach leverages prior knowledge to improve safety, interpretability, and decision-making, and integrates methods such as Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies.

Result: The paper underscores the unexplored potential of combining model-based agents and model-free reinforcement learning to achieve sample-efficient learning and safe, interpretable decision-making.

Conclusion: Model-based agents represent a promising framework for addressing the limitations of model-free RL, offering a pathway to more effective autonomous decision-making systems when combined innovatively.

Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty
has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across
fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled
decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system
interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL
has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function
approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's
policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify
the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited
interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces
model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy
approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and
constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system
knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,
while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We
outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents --
exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning
approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies,
along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been
established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored,
motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient
learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The competition aims to explore and address real-life AI security issues linked to data poisoning and overreliance on LLMs, which lack sufficient research.

Method: Participants are tasked to create or adapt techniques to distinguish between genuine LLM output and maliciously manipulated results.

Result: The competition serves as a platform to develop innovative approaches to AI assurance in security-critical domains such as space applications.

Conclusion: This effort contributes to advancing the understanding and mitigation of AI vulnerabilities, especially in sensitive and high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The "Fake or Real" competition hosted on Kaggle
(\href{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt}{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt})

to the "Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the
European Space Agency
(\href{https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/}{https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/}).
The competition idea is based on two real-life AI security threats identified
within the project -- data poisoning and overreliance in Large Language Models.
The task is to distinguish between the proper output from LLM and the output
generated under malicious modification of the LLM. As this problem was not
extensively researched, participants are required to develop new techniques to
address this issue or adjust already existing ones to this problem's statement.

*Yongyi Yang,Hidenori Tanaka,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework, called double convergence, to explain how in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) works, providing insights into its mechanisms and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to understand how LLMs achieve in-context learning, particularly why they can internalize data generation processes and display structured hidden representations without parameter updates.

Method: The authors propose a unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge over both context and across layers, leading to biases towards smooth, low-frequency representations. They verify the framework with analytical proofs and empirical experiments.

Result: The authors found that the double convergence framework explains phenomena such as globally structured but locally distorted geometry of representations, non-vanishing energy decay, and intrinsic robustness against high-frequency noise in ICL.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a theoretical foundation for studying in-context learning in large language models, providing explanations for observed phenomena and insights into its robustness and mechanisms.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new
behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent
studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in
pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating
process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the
mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we
present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a
unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge
both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to
an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove
analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical
observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured
but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without
vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness
towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results
provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical
foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data
distributions and settings.

*Beka Begiashvili,Carlos J. Fernandez-Candel,Matías Pérez Paredes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel AI-derived echocardiographic parameter, Acoustic Index, quantifies cardiac dysfunction using ultrasound sequences and clinical data, exhibiting high accuracy (AUC of 0.89).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cardiac dysfunction remains challenging due to limitations in traditional echocardiographic parameters like EF and GLS.

Method: The paper introduces the Acoustic Index, combining EDMD and a hybrid neural network to process spatiotemporal echocardiographic data and clinical metadata into a continuous 0-1 risk score.

Result: Acoustic Index demonstrates strong predictive performance (AUC 0.89) in a cohort of 736 patients, with consistent sensitivity and specificity above 0.8 during cross-validation.

Conclusion: The Acoustic Index is an interpretable and scalable AI biomarker with potential for widespread clinical use to detect and monitor cardiac dysfunction, requiring further external validation and disease-specific adaptations.

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and
global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of
cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and
GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing
need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that
capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic
parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound
views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on
Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical
metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic
sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via
attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,
resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac
pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five
folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and
specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based
analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,
with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker
for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool
for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions
include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to
disease-specific classifiers.

### [174] [Time Series Forecastability Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13556)
*Rui Wang,Steven Klee,Alexis Roos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two metrics—the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent—for evaluating the forecastability of time series before model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify inherent forecastability in time series data prior to forecast modeling, helping practitioners focus on more predictable data.

Method: Utilizes the spectral predictability score to measure frequency regularity and Lyapunov exponents to assess chaos and stability. Tested these metrics on synthetic and real-world data, including the M5 competition dataset.

Result: Demonstrated a strong correlation between the proposed metrics and actual forecast performance of various models.

Conclusion: The metrics allow pre-modeling evaluation of time series data, enabling better planning and expectation management for forecasting tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time
series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these
measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before
any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength
and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov
exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data.
We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and
real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent
forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual
forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent
forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus
their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more
forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative
strategies for products with limited forecastability.

*Mrinal Mathur,Mike Doan,Barak Pearlmutter,Sergey Plis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SELF-Transformer, an encoder that iteratively refines attention weights to overcome the expressive limitations of standard Transformers, showing significant accuracy gains without altering parameter count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers evaluated in a single pass are limited by their expressive power, and while autoregression boosts this, it introduces token-level external feedback loops resembling language processing. The authors sought a method to enhance encoder-transformers' capability without token-level autoregression.

Method: The SELF-Transformer refines attention weights iteratively to reach a fixed point, enabling adaptivity to input difficulty during test time and avoiding token-level externalization.

Result: Tests demonstrated up to 20% accuracy improvement on benchmarks for encoder architectures without added parameters, enabled by adaptive computation based on input complexity.

Conclusion: SELF-Transformers achieve a balance between enhanced expressive power and the simplicity of encoder architectures, leveraging input-adaptive alignment for improved performance.

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in
expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer
autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,
more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback
loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in
subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning,
biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as
language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without
resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an
encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed
point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes
the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix
internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This
adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without
increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test
time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.
Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative
reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that
power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a
3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural
innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and

### [177] [Learning Pluralistic User Preferences through Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuned Summaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13579)
*Hyunji Nam,Yanming Wan,Mickel Liu,Jianxun Lian,Natasha Jaques*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), which personalizes large language model responses by summarizing individual user preferences and characteristics for better alignment with user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) improves language models' helpfulness and fluency, it does not account for individual variability and preferences among users, creating a need for more personalized approaches.

Method: The authors propose PLUS, which generates textual summaries of individual users' preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition a reward model to enable personalized response predictions. The system uses reinforcement learning for training and incorporates a co-adaptation loop to simultaneously update the user summarization model and the reward model.

Result: PLUS is shown to produce meaningful summaries that capture individual user preferences better than prior personalized RLHF or in-context learning techniques. Summaries are robust across diverse users and conversation topics and enable zero-shot personalization on proprietary models like GPT-4.

Conclusion: The PLUS framework allows for interpretable, concise, and transferable user summaries, facilitating more transparent and user-controllable personalization in large language models.

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have
expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to
align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more
helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it
models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a
novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns
text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past
conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make
personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We
train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the
reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show
that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context
learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful
aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we
show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users
can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary
models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and
portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more
transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

### [178] [Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for Matching Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13608)
*Yudai Hayashi,Shuhei Goda,Yuta Saito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes new Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) estimators, DiPS and DPR, designed for matching markets to better handle bias, variance, and reward sparsity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OPE methods in matching platforms are unreliable due to high variance and reward sparsity issues, which hinder effective policy evaluation and frequent updates.

Method: The authors introduce two novel estimators, DiPS and DPR, which combine elements of Direct Method, Inverse Propensity Score, and Doubly Robust estimators while utilizing intermediate engagement signals to improve bias-variance control.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows advantages in bias and variance, and empirical tests on synthetic and real job-matching data demonstrate superior performance of the proposed estimators over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed estimators effectively address challenges in matching markets, enhancing OPE reliability and enabling better policy learning for improved reciprocal recommendations.

Abstract: Matching users based on mutual preferences is a fundamental aspect of
services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search and dating
applications. Although A/B tests remain the gold standard for evaluating new
policies in recommender systems for matching markets, it is costly and
impractical for frequent policy updates. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays
a crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only
offline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike
conventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature
of user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and
exacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address
these challenges and facilitate effective offline evaluation, we propose novel
OPE estimators, \textit{DiPS} and \textit{DPR}, specifically designed for
matching markets. Our methods combine elements of the Direct Method (DM),
Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators while
incorporating intermediate labels, such as initial engagement signals, to
achieve better bias-variance control in matching markets. Theoretically, we
derive the bias and variance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their
advantages over conventional methods. Furthermore, we show that these
estimators can be seamlessly extended to offline policy learning methods for
improving recommendation policies for making more matches. We empirically
evaluate our methods through experiments on both synthetic data and A/B testing
logs from a real job-matching platform. The empirical results highlight the
superiority of our approach over existing methods in off-policy evaluation and
learning tasks for a variety of configurations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tri-GFN, a novel framework combining GCN, Autoencoder, and Graph Transformer for improved graph clustering, showcasing significant accuracy boosts across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to overcome persistent challenges in graph data analysis, such as over-smoothing and performance limitations when dealing with heterogeneous graph data, which undermine clustering quality.

Method: The Tri-GFN framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer through a triple-channel enhancement module and employs a tri-learning mechanism with a feature fusion strategy to extract and unify node attributes and topological features.

Result: Tri-GFN achieves significant accuracy improvements: 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14% on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58% on the USPS dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Tri-GFN framework efficiently addresses clustering challenges in graph data, showcasing strong potential for applications such as automatic news classification and topic retrieval.

Abstract: In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made
significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges
such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale
and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality.
Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues,
its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To
address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework
that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the
Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the
differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a
unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The
framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components
are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes
the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust
clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning
among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to
capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations
for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the
Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding
performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news
classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity in bimanual robotic manipulation, which limits further scaling up in complex tasks.

Method: The proposed approach, VIDAR, involves a two-stage framework. First, a large-scale video diffusion model is pre-trained on 750K multi-view videos from bimanual robot platforms. Second, a masked inverse dynamics model is trained to predict actions by extracting relevant information without pixel-level labels.

Result: VIDAR demonstrates strong performance on unseen robot platforms and tasks with just 20 minutes of human demonstrations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and generalizing to diverse tasks and backgrounds.

Conclusion: The study showcases the practicality of using video foundation models and masked action prediction to enable scalable, generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world applications.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

*Yue Yang,Zihan Su,Ying Zhang,Chang Chuan Goh,Yuxiang Lin,Anthony Graham Bellotti,Boon Giin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces two novel architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, for early and accurate loan default prediction by effectively combining KAN with GRU and LSTM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current loan default models struggle with early predictions and reliance on same-year data, which limits their practicality in detecting potential risks in advance.

Method: The study merges Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with GRU and LSTM to create new architectures, and evaluates their performance against baseline models through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUC.

Result: The proposed models show significant performance improvements, with over 92% accuracy for three-month advance predictions and over 88% for eight-month advance predictions, outperforming standard architectures.

Conclusion: GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN present a robust step forward in early loan default prediction, addressing key limitations in legacy methods and offering substantial advantages for financial risk management.

Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in time series anomaly detection:
enhancing the predictive capability of loan default models more than three
months in advance to enable early identification of default events, helping
financial institutions implement preventive measures before risk events
materialize. Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of
accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing
within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their
practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study
introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against
the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms
of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature
window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months
in advance and over 88% eight months in advance, significantly outperforming
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-Inspired Graph Neural Networks (PI-GNNs) show limitations in handling dense combinatorial problem graphs, and the paper proposes new methods inspired by fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combinatorial optimization problems encoded as graphs are crucial in many domains, but PI-GNNs perform poorly with dense graphs, necessitating further improvements.

Method: Identified performance issues in PI-GNNs for dense graphs, analyzed training dynamics, and introduced strategies from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks to enhance the framework.

Result: Proposed methods overcame performance degradation of PI-GNNs in high-density graph settings, demonstrating significant improvement.

Conclusion: The enhanced strategies enable PI-GNNs to better handle dense combinatorial problems, bridging the gap between model outputs and problem solutions.

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an
efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization
problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting
dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded
promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the
performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of
the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase
transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate
solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the
relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To
address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive
strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized
neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed
methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense
settings.

### [184] [Learning Deformable Body Interactions With Adaptive Spatial Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13707)
*Hao Wang,Yu Liu,Daniel Biggs,Haoru Wang,Jiandong Yu,Ping Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST) method to tackle scalability issues in simulating deformable body interactions using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving accuracy and scalability even for large-scale meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulations of deformable bodies are crucial in various fields, but learning-based methods like Graph Neural Networks face computational challenges when scaling to large multi-node meshes due to the need for dynamically created pairwise global edges.

Method: The authors propose Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST), which maps unstructured meshes to grid-based representations. Sparse grid cells are summarized into fixed-length embeddings via cross-attention modules, and self-attention is then used to predict physical states in latent space. This tokenization lessens computational demands while maintaining expressiveness.

Result: Experiments show the AST method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy for simulating deformable body interactions. It excels in handling large meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where current methods often fail.

Conclusion: The AST framework enables scalable and efficient simulations of deformable body interactions, advancing the field. In addition, the authors provide a novel dataset to promote further research on large-scale deformable body simulations.

Abstract: Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like
material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods
with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical
systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body
interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have
to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical
for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from
geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)
method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the
simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this
structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then
apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,
fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.
Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens
in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and
the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable
simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable
body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations
with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by
computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale
dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support
future research in this area.

Conclusion: The framework and models improve efficiency and reliability in failure analysis for autonomous cargo ships, supporting advanced fault diagnosis and decision-making systems.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component
failures in autonomous cargo ships (ACS) and the uncertainties in emergency

for constructing a graph-structured dataset of failure modes. By employing an
improved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency
is significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to
the NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature
fusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode
subsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and
Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and
emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,
and 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model
achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.
Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are
highly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based
Meteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high

Motivation: To investigate the unexplored impact of adversarial training on generalization performance in audio classification with substantial data distribution shifts.

Method: The study evaluates two adversarial training strategies—output-space attacks and embedding-space attacks—on ConvNeXt and AudioProtoPNet using a bird sound classification benchmark.

Result: Adversarial training, especially using output-space attacks, improved clean test data performance by 10.5% on average and enhanced adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: Adversarial training can effectively improve model robustness against both distribution shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification tasks.

Abstract: Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness
against adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under
substantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different
adversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and
adversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model
architectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an
inherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach
is evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This
benchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training
and test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a
common real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial
training strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the
classification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks
designed to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used
for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses
the stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.
Results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space
attacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative
and simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These
findings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial
training holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution
shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.

*Shangyou Wang,Zezhong Ding,Xike Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SamGoG, a framework addressing class and graph size imbalances in graph classification using efficient sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in graph classification caused by class imbalance and graph size imbalance in real-world applications, which negatively impact learning and model performance.

Method: The authors propose SamGoG, which employs an importance-based sampling mechanism to construct multiple Graph-of-Graphs (GoGs) and train them sequentially. The sampling enhances edge homophily by incorporating learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive node degree.

Result: SamGoG yields a significant performance boost, achieving up to a 15.66% improvement in accuracy and 6.7x acceleration in training compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SamGoG effectively addresses imbalance issues in graph classification tasks and integrates seamlessly with various downstream GNNs, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph
classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based
representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of
imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias
the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically
address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this
work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning
framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance.
SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling
mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates
the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge
homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly
integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for
graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a
15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of deploying AI models in resource-constrained environments by introducing optimization techniques using transformer-based models and multiple optimization tools, achieving significant speed and memory improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to optimize large AI models for deployment on edge devices and resource-constrained environments, addressing issues like energy consumption, memory usage, and latency.

Method: The researchers use supervised transformer-based models for ontology alignment, employ the ONNX Runtime backend with Microsoft Olive for optimization, and apply dynamic quantization using Intel Neural Compressor and Intel Extension for PyTorch.

Result: Experiments on DEFT 2020 tasks showed a 20x inference speed-up and approximately 70% memory usage reduction, all while retaining performance metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization techniques effectively improve model efficiency, make them deployable in limited-resource environments, and set a new state-of-the-art in performance for the chosen tasks.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more
advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational
demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained
environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory
usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the
future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by
employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research
introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based
semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to
search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using
the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic
quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for
PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on
the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new
state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining
an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately
70%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian Flow Networks face constraints in designing flexible distribution transformation pathways and adapting to diverse data distributions, necessitating exploration of simpler and efficient parameter-space-based models.

Method: The authors introduce Parameter Interpolation Flow (PIF), with a detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures, and specifically adapt it as MolPIF for drug design tasks.

Result: MolPIF demonstrates superior performance in structure-based drug design across diverse metrics, surpassing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study establishes the effectiveness of parameter-space-driven models like MolPIF, providing novel directions in molecular generative model design for drug discovery.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in
accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown
impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often
ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space.
However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing
more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to
adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore,
the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is
unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow
model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference
procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design,
demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to
baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based
generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for
model design.

*Enhao Cheng,Shoujia Zhang,Jianhua Yin,Li Jin,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) method that leverages neighbor distribution and dual-center optimization for more effective graph clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph clustering is challenging due to its unsupervised nature and limitations of pseudo-label-based methods that rely on single-target distributions.

Method: The proposed DCGC involves representation learning using neighbor distribution and integrates dual-target distribution with dual-center optimization, which includes both feature and neighbor distribution centers.

Result: Experiments highlight improved performance and robustness of the proposed DCGC technique compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The DCGC method provides reliable supervision signals and enhanced clustering capabilities, establishing it as an effective approach for graph clustering tasks.

Abstract: Graph clustering is crucial for unraveling intricate data structures, yet it
presents significant challenges due to its unsupervised nature. Recently,
goal-directed clustering techniques have yielded impressive results, with
contrastive learning methods leveraging pseudo-label garnering considerable
attention. Nonetheless, pseudo-label as a supervision signal is unreliable and
existing goal-directed approaches utilize only features to construct a
single-target distribution for single-center optimization, which lead to
incomplete and less dependable guidance. In our work, we propose a novel
Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) approach based on neighbor distribution
properties, which includes representation learning with neighbor distribution
and dual-center optimization. Specifically, we utilize neighbor distribution as
a supervision signal to mine hard negative samples in contrastive learning,
which is reliable and enhances the effectiveness of representation learning.
Furthermore, neighbor distribution center is introduced alongside feature
center to jointly construct a dual-target distribution for dual-center
optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate superior
performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

*Tim Rensmeyer,Denis Kramer,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel fine-tuning approach for interatomic force fields using Bayesian neural networks and on-the-fly learning to address the challenge of assessing uncertainty and detecting rare events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the computational burden of creating diverse training datasets for interatomic machine learning force fields and the difficulties for end-users without ML expertise. The study aims to tackle these issues by fine-tuning foundation models with reduced data requirements and automated on-the-fly learning.

Method: The authors employ Bayesian neural network methods to quantify uncertainty during fine-tuning and integrate an on-the-fly workflow. This workflow automates dataset creation, ensuring desired accuracy while detecting and sampling rare events effectively.

Result: The proposed approach successfully automates the fine-tuning process, enabling efficient training with minimal data while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, it highlights the ability to detect rare events like transition states and sample them at an enhanced rate.

Conclusion: The study provides a significant advancement in interatomic machine learning force fields by combining uncertainty-aware fine-tuning with automated on-the-fly learning, addressing both computational and accessibility challenges in the field.

Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from
first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has
become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training
datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a
computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare
events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation
models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular
databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data
necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach
requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can
still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events
and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.
In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely
automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the
model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with
classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying
this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to
assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even
though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In
this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach
based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow
that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified
accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them
at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

*Aditi Anand,Suman Banerjee,Dildar Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on solving a Reinforcement Learning problem where the reward function follows a submodular nature, by proposing a pruned submodularity graph-based method that outperforms baseline approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Reinforcement Learning assumes additive reward functions, but many real-world problems like path planning involve submodular reward functions, necessitating a new approach.

Method: The authors introduce a pruned submodularity graph-based algorithm, which is designed to maximize submodular reward functions with feasible time and space complexity, providing provably approximate solutions.

Result: The proposed method, applied to a benchmark agent-environment setup, showed improved rewards compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in solving RL problems with submodular reward functions, offering better performance guarantees and practical efficiency.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the
environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some
unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such
that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional
setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in
reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control,
etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled
as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem
where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an
optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed
a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably
approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has
been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a
performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment
setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are
reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed
approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional supervised machine learning, which requires large labeled datasets for phenotype prediction in gene expression data, by using self-supervised learning to leverage unlabeled data effectively.

Method: The study applied three state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data, assessing their ability to capture data structure and improve downstream predictive tasks using several publicly available datasets.

Result: The results indicate that self-supervised learning methods outperform traditional supervised models in phenotype prediction accuracy and reduce reliance on annotated data. The study also provides a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of each method.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning is a promising tool for analyzing gene expression data, offering significant benefits over traditional methods. The paper includes recommendations for method selection and identifies future research directions, marking this as the first study focusing on self-supervised learning in bulk RNA-Seq data.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in
biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,
and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely
on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that
are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.
Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the
structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data
for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on
different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure
of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for
downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene
expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively
capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The
results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform
traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by
reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis
of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and
limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending
on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to
enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene
expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk
RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

### [196] [Reframing attention as a reinforcement learning problem for causal discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13920)
*Turan Orujlu,Christian Gumbsch,Martin V. Butz,Charley M Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework and model for representing and inferring dynamic causal hypotheses in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, outperforming current methods and enabling recovery of dynamic causal graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural network models struggle to effectively account for dynamic causal interactions, and static causal graph assumptions limit progress in causal representation learning.

Method: The authors propose a novel Causal Process framework for dynamic causal structures and implement it through the Causal Process Model, integrating it with Transformer-style attention mechanisms for RL tasks.

Result: The approach outperforms existing methods in RL environments, improving causal representation learning, agent performance, and uniquely recovering dynamic causal graphs.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new direction by combining causal inference with RL, enabling interpretable causal processes and improving task performance through dynamic hypothesis construction.

Abstract: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern
trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival
of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural
networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality
assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal
interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel
theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,
we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This
allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer
networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal
processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to
constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested
within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we
employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the
original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in
causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover
graphs of dynamic causal processes.

*Jingbo Liang,Bruna Jacobson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces MoDyGAN, a pipeline that combines molecular dynamics simulations and GANs to explore protein conformational spaces efficiently by transforming 3D structures into 2D data for advanced deep learning applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently exploring protein conformations is computationally challenging with traditional physics-based dynamic simulations, necessitating innovative solutions.

Method: MoDyGAN employs MD simulations alongside GANs, using a generator for protein trajectories derived from Gaussian distributions, a refinement module with ensemble learning and dual-discriminators, and a reversible 2D representation of 3D structures for advanced GAN architectures.

Result: MoDyGAN successfully generated plausible conformations for rigid proteins and demonstrated alignment of latent space interpolations with steered MD simulations for deca-alanine.

Conclusion: MoDyGAN provides an innovative and efficient approach to sampling protein conformational states, showcasing the viability of 2D protein representations for advanced deep learning and potential applications to other 3D structures.

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major
challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved
in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel
pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational
spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into
MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble
learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of
generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative
representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into
2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use
three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new
conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that
interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained
from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that
representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying
advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an
efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed
framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores integrating average controllability into graph-based machine learning models to enhance anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection faces challenges due to data imbalance and limited anomalous samples, especially in complex graph-based domains.

Method: The study incorporates average controllability via two strategies: using it as an edge weight and encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector in graph-based learning frameworks.

Result: Experimental evaluations across real and synthetic networks show improved anomaly detection performance when average controllability is utilized.

Conclusion: Incorporating average controllability into graph models enhances anomaly detection, especially in sparse and imbalanced datasets, offering new insights for graph machine learning advancements.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the
need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of
anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have
emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to
uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates
the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning
with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation
of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can
significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two
novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based
frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2)
encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on
real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our
proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies,
highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the
performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the
potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to
address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the classification of cuneiform signs using machine learning, employing ResNet50 to analyze Old Babylonian texts, achieving high classification accuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge posed by variability in cuneiform signs and establish standards for data acquisition and future classification tasks.

Method: ResNet50 was used as the ML model, trained on handwritten Old Babylonian texts originating from three Mesopotamian cities.

Result: ResNet50 achieved a top-1 accuracy of 87.1% and top-5 accuracy of 96.5% for signs with at least 20 instances.

Conclusion: The study offers foundational results for cuneiform sign classification and aims to influence data acquisition processes and future research directions.

Abstract: The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine
learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a
lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for
what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This
variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will
perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such
differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim
to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation
for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained
and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary
texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities
(Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is
ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for
signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are
the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses biases in multi-site structural connectome studies due to scanner differences and proposes a deep learning framework for harmonization without requiring metadata or traveling subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural connectome studies are hindered by small sample sizes, scanner heterogeneity, and limited generalizability in neurological disorder research. This paper aims to improve SC reliability across multi-site studies.

Method: The authors propose a site-conditioned deep harmonization framework and benchmark three architectures (fully connected AE, convolutional AE, graph convolutional AE) against linear regression in simulated Human Connectome data.

Result: Non-graph models performed well in prediction tasks, but graph convolutional architectures excelled at preserving topological structure and individuality. Linear regression performed well numerically but lacks practical applicability due to metadata requirements.

Conclusion: Graph-based deep architectures are promising for domain-general SC harmonization, preserving graph-topology and individuality, especially for multi-site studies where metadata is unavailable.

Abstract: Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome
(SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for
neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and
generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have
acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging
consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -
such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate
these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or
overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a
site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across
diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a
simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this
framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected
autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a
top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight
prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior
preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as
reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although
the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly
modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world
multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our
results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization
performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly
well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in
large-scale multi-site SC studies.

*Itay Katav,Aryeh Kontorovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ParallelTime, an architecture that improves multivariate time series forecasting by employing a dynamic weighting mechanism for long- and short-term dependencies instead of equal weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of equal weighting in capturing long- and short-term dependencies in multivariate time series forecasting.

Method: The authors propose the ParallelTime Weighter, which dynamically assigns weights to long-term and short-term dependencies based on input and model knowledge, integrated into the ParallelTime architecture.

Result: The model delivers state-of-the-art performance, reducing FLOPs, using fewer parameters, scaling to longer horizons, and outperforming existing frameworks on diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: ParallelTime showcases an effective approach for enhancing time series forecasting, offering robustness, efficiency, and scalability, paving the way for future parallel Attention-Mamba developments.

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two
architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural
language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window
attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing
long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to
both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to
long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we
propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates
interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token
based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the
ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter
mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.
Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer
parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly
outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for
future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The
implementation is readily available at:

### [202] [On the Fundamental Limitations of Dual Static CVaR Decompositions in Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14005)
*Mathieu Godbout,Audrey Durand*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores issues in using dynamic programming for evaluating CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes, identifying a root cause tied to inconsistent constraints in risk assignments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic programming methods for static CVaR-optimal policies have shown to fail under the dual formulation, yet the underlying reasons remain unclear.

Method: The authors shift focus from policy optimization to policy evaluation, framing it as minimization problems and introducing 'risk-assignment consistency constraints' to quantify errors.

Result: The work demonstrates that errors previously observed are due to inconsistent risk assignments. It also identifies fundamental limitations in finding uniformly optimal policies across initial risk levels.

Conclusion: Searching for a single uniformly optimal policy using dual CVaR decomposition is inherently restricted due to mismatch across risk assignment conditions.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods for finding
static CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can fail when
based on the dual formulation, yet the root cause for the failure has remained
unclear. We expand on these findings by shifting focus from policy optimization
to the seemingly simpler task of policy evaluation. We show that evaluating the
static CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization
problems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency
constraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of
the constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation
errors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then
demonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR
DP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap.
We then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the
search for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR
decomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single
policy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.

Motivation: To construct a robust federated Gaussian process regression capable of handling Byzantine failures, which compromise learning in collaborative systems.

Method: Proposes a cloud-agent setup where local GPR sends predictions to the cloud, which aggregates models using a resilient method and broadcasts it back for fusion with agents' GPR models.

Result: The method improves learning accuracy, demonstrated experimentally on toy and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The algorithm facilitates collaborative learning while countering potential adversarial behaviors among agents, enhancing global learning performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for
Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated
GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively
learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents
exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial
behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local
predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global
model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the
cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused
GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of
the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy
improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR.
Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

*Aileen Luo,Tao Zhou,Ming Du,Martin V. Holt,Andrej Singer,Mathew J. Cherukara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DONUT, a physics-aware neural network, for real-time automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data, outperforming conventional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time analysis of coherent X-ray scattering experiments faces significant bottlenecks due to artifacts, computational demands, and inherent data complexities.

Method: The authors developed DONUT, incorporating a differentiable geometric diffraction model within its neural network architecture, enabling unsupervised, real-time analysis without pre-labeled datasets.

Result: Experimental results show that DONUT is over 200 times more efficient than traditional fitting methods, accurately extracting crystal lattice strain and orientation.

Conclusion: DONUT provides a transformative tool for nanoscale structural analysis, addressing prevailing computational challenges and enabling rapid, accurate data interpretation.

Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are critical for investigating the
fundamental structural properties of materials at the nanoscale. While
advancements have made these experiments more accessible, real-time analysis
remains a significant bottleneck, often hindered by artifacts and computational
demands. In scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy, which is widely used to
spatially resolve structural heterogeneities, this challenge is compounded by
the convolution of the divergent beam with the sample's local structure. To
address this, we introduce DONUT (Diffraction with Optics for Nanobeam by
Unsupervised Training), a physics-aware neural network designed for the rapid
and automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data. By incorporating a
differentiable geometric diffraction model directly into its architecture,
DONUT learns to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation in real-time.
Crucially, this is achieved without reliance on labeled datasets or
pre-training, overcoming a fundamental limitation for supervised machine
learning in X-ray science. We demonstrate experimentally that DONUT accurately
extracts all features within the data over 200 times more efficiently than
conventional fitting methods.

### [205] [Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056)
*Alejandro Rodriguez-Garcia,Anindya Ghosh,Srikanth Ramaswamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a stability gap in continual learning and proposes uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics inspired by biological processes to mitigate this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the stability gap in continual learning, where performance drops occur on mastered tasks upon learning new ones, even under ideal settings.

Method: The authors propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics, inspired by neuromodulatory signals in the brain, to approximate a two-timescale optimizer for balancing adaptation and retention of knowledge.

Result: The proposed mechanism significantly reduces the stability gap in domain and class-incremental learning for MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks during joint training.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics provide a biologically inspired solution to minimize stability gaps in continual learning, improving task performance and retention.

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in
performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the
stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,
revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,
persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within
this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other
sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid
adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to
investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual
learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating
concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to
modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native
multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam
introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.
Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently
enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we
propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that
approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of
knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We
evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of
the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that
uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.
Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic
functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing
stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

*Ni Mu,Yao Luan,Qing-Shan Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces preference-based multi-objective reinforcement learning (Pb-MORL), integrating preferences into MORL to optimize policies across Pareto frontiers effectively, outperforming traditional methods in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complexities in designing reward functions for balancing competing objectives in multi-objective tasks and to leverage preferences as a more intuitive alternative.

Method: The method involves formalizing preferences into the MORL framework, constructing a multi-objective reward model aligned with preferences, and optimizing this model theoretically equivalent to finding Pareto optimal policies.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated competitive results, outperforming methods relying on ground truth reward functions across benchmark tasks, multi-energy management, and autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Preference-based MORL is effective for real-world applications, proving its ability to derive optimal policies across Pareto frontiers, surpassing traditional approaches in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for
optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on
pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing
conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as
more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for
complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL
(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL
framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across
the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our
method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given
preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this
reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive
experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,
and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method
performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground
truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications
in complex real-world systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents the DPMT framework, which improves human-AI collaboration by employing cognitive science-based dual process theory and multi-scale theory of mind.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to address limitations in AI agents, particularly large language models, that fail to accurately model complex human mental characteristics and adapt effectively to diverse behaviors in dynamic scenarios.

Method: The proposed method is the DPMT framework, which uses dual process theory from cognitive science and incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM) module for better mental characteristic reasoning and human partner modeling.

Result: Experimental results show that the DPMT framework significantly improves collaboration between humans and AI agents. Ablation studies also support the effectiveness of the multi-scale ToM component.

Conclusion: The DPMT framework represents a meaningful advancement in enhancing human-AI interaction by leveraging cognitive science principles for better adaptation and understanding of human behaviors.

Abstract: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet
challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human
behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents
often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as
domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of
mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process
theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)
module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental
characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT
significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further
validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

*Pankaj Yadav,Vivek Vijay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in class-imbalanced classification, finding that they perform well on raw imbalanced datasets but face computational challenges and are incompatible with conventional imbalance strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the practicality and limitations of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) compared to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in addressing imbalanced classification problems.

Method: An empirical study was conducted using KANs and MLPs on ten benchmark datasets, comparing their performance on raw imbalanced data and with resampling strategies or focal loss.

Result: KANs showed strong performance on raw imbalanced data compared to MLPs but deteriorated with imbalance strategies. MLPs achieved similar performance to KANs with lower resource requirements when imbalance techniques were applied.

Conclusion: KANs excel in raw imbalanced data but are resource-intensive and incompatible with conventional resampling techniques, highlighting the need for architectural and efficiency improvements for broader practical use.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in
neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard
neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context
of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe
that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively
than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,
conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical
structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade
KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from
prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.
Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve
equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.
These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw
imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource
tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently
limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as
developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,
optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict
with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next
generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes that neural networks using layer-specific bio-inspired learning rules, discovered via neural-architecture search (NAS), achieve better accuracy and scalability while maintaining robustness advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bio-inspired neural networks offer benefits like robustness and energy efficiency, but their performance and scalability often lag compared to back-propagation (BP)-based models.

Method: A tailored neural-architecture search (NAS) is used to identify optimal bio-inspired learning rules for different layers. The search space is expanded to accommodate these rules, and the best architecture is determined layer by layer.

Result: Neural networks using mixed bio-inspired learning rules set new performance records across datasets such as CIFAR-10 (95.16%), CIFAR-100 (76.48%), ImageNet16-120 (43.42%), and ImageNet (60.51% top-1). Some even outperform BP-based models.

Conclusion: Layer-specific diversity in bio-inspired learning rules enhances neural network performance and scalability, motivating further exploration of mixed learning rule approaches.

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.

Motivation: To create adaptive and high-performing racing controllers in a complex space simulation with challenging physics and flexible circuit designs.

Method: The controllers were optimized using NEAT to evolve both neural network structures and weights, tested under Xpilot-AI's physics and parallel evaluation setups.

Result: Evolved controllers achieved up to 32% faster lap times and developed human-like racing strategies, such as optimal cornering.

Conclusion: The NEAT algorithm proves effective for evolving robust control strategies in challenging simulation environments, and Xpilot-AI is validated as a strong AI testbed.

Abstract: This paper investigates the development of high-performance racing
controllers for a newly implemented racing mode within the Xpilot-AI platform,
utilizing the Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. By
leveraging NEAT's capability to evolve both the structure and weights of neural
networks, we develop adaptive controllers that can navigate complex circuits
under the challenging space simulation physics of Xpilot-AI, which includes
elements such as inertia, friction, and gravity. The racing mode we introduce
supports flexible circuit designs and allows for the evaluation of multiple
agents in parallel, enabling efficient controller optimization across
generations. Experimental results demonstrate that our evolved controllers
achieve up to 32% improvement in lap time compared to the controller's initial
performance and develop effective racing strategies, such as optimal cornering
and speed modulation, comparable to human-like techniques. This work
illustrates NEAT's effectiveness in producing robust control strategies within
demanding game environments and highlights Xpilot-AI's potential as a rigorous
testbed for competitive AI controller evolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional neural architecture search methods require significant manual effort. The authors aim to create a more autonomous and biologically-inspired approach to efficiently grow complex neural networks.

Method: The authors developed MorphoNAS, a system based on morphogenetic self-organization principles like the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene regulatory networks. Simple genomes define morphogen dynamics and rules to grow neural networks via local interactions.

Result: MorphoNAS demonstrated its success in two tasks: structural targeting, generating predefined graph configurations (8-31 nodes), and functional performance on CartPole, producing minimal complexity solutions (6-7 neurons). The system balanced solution quality and search efficiency throughout evolution.

Conclusion: MorphoNAS effectively grows biologically-inspired, adaptive neural architectures with simple developmental rules, showcasing its potential for efficient and autonomous neural architecture search methods.

Abstract: While biological neural networks develop from compact genomes using
relatively simple rules, modern artificial neural architecture search methods
mostly involve explicit and routine manual work. In this paper, we introduce
MorphoNAS (Morphogenetic Neural Architecture Search), a system able to
deterministically grow neural networks through morphogenetic self-organization
inspired by the Free Energy Principle, reaction-diffusion systems, and gene
regulatory networks. In MorphoNAS, simple genomes encode just morphogens
dynamics and threshold-based rules of cellular development. Nevertheless, this
leads to self-organization of a single progenitor cell into complex neural
networks, while the entire process is built on local chemical interactions. Our
evolutionary experiments focused on two different domains: structural
targeting, in which MorphoNAS system was able to find fully successful genomes
able to generate predefined random graph configurations (8-31 nodes); and
functional performance on the CartPole control task achieving low complexity
6-7 neuron solutions when target network size minimization evolutionary
pressure was applied. The evolutionary process successfully balanced between
quality of of the final solutions and neural architecture search effectiveness.
Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed MorphoNAS method is able to
grow complex specific neural architectures, using simple developmental rules,
which suggests a feasible biological route to adaptive and efficient neural
architecture search.

Motivation: To model cognitive processes based on the perspective of a living system preserving vital equilibria, rather than external observation.

Method: Developed an algorithmic schema (EGO) with a self-referential language (E-language), simulating cognitive processes according to Hebbian operations.

Result: Implemented and tested a prototype of EGO (EGO-P) successfully.

Conclusion: EGO provides a foundational method to simulate experiential and cognitive processes through the living system's perspective.

Abstract: This article proposes a method to formalise models of cognitive processes
grounded in experience, considering experience from the perspective of a living
system and not from that of an observer of the living system. The perspective
of a living system is defined by the need of the system to preserve the vital
equilibria. The method is based on an algorithmic schema that we call
Environment Generative Operator (EGO) and uses a self-referential language
developed for this purpose which we call E-language. EGO simulates cognitive
processes as operations on neuron assemblies as understood by Hebb. In this
article we present an EGO prototype (EGO-P) which has already been implemented

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI accelerators face limitations due to fixed memory-to-compute ratios, hindering scalability and efficiency in distributed AI training and inference.

Method: The paper integrates HBM3E memory, photonic switches, and external DDR5 into a 2.5D electro-optical package. It uses the CelestiSim simulator to evaluate NVIDIA GPU performance with these innovations.

Result: The proposed system achieves up to 7.04x throughput, 1.41x latency improvements, and 60-90% energy savings during large language model (LLM) training and inference simulations.

Conclusion: The Photonic FabricTM successfully enhances scalability, bandwidth, and efficiency in AI processing, addressing silicon constraints and benefiting various accelerators.

Abstract: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM
(PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low
latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth
HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D
electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory
alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM
enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies
more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint
that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current
XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet
that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and
correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling
well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a
lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It
is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA,
without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the
simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency
improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and
1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data
movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While
these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other
AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of
fixed memory to compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current random variate generation methods often lack precision, overflow problems, dependency on arbitrary-precision arithmetic, or inconsistent APIs. There is a need for a universal method that guarantees accuracy and operational efficiency.

Method: The proposed method uses finite-precision numerical programs to specify CDFs and synthesizes random variate generators. It employs a novel implementation that achieves the optimal Knuth and Yao entropy rate while maintaining precision and avoiding overflows.

Result: The introduced approach demonstrates competitive runtime, higher accuracy, and better entropy efficiency compared to the GNU Scientific Library. It supports various number formats and distributions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a universal and automated method for random variate generation with formal guarantees, optimal entropy efficiency, and high practical utility, addressing precision and operational constraints.

Abstract: This article introduces a new approach to principled and practical random
variate generation with formal guarantees. The key idea is to first specify the
desired probability distribution in terms of a finite-precision numerical
program that defines its cumulative distribution function (CDF), and then
generate exact random variates according to this CDF. We present a universal
and fully automated method to synthesize exact random variate generators given
any numerical CDF implemented in any binary number format, such as
floating-point, fixed-point, and posits. The method is guaranteed to operate
with the same precision used to specify the CDF, does not overflow, avoids
expensive arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and exposes a consistent API. The
method rests on a novel space-time optimal implementation for the class of
generators that attain the information-theoretically optimal Knuth and Yao
entropy rate, consuming the least possible number of input random bits per
output variate. We develop a random variate generation library using our method
in C and evaluate it on a diverse set of ``continuous'' and ``discrete''
distributions, showing competitive runtime with the state-of-the-art GNU
Scientific Library while delivering higher accuracy, entropy efficiency, and
automation.

TL;DR: This paper extends the Gradual C0 verifier with unfolding expressions to improve its ability to handle recursive heap data structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static verification guarantees code correctness but involves substantial effort to fully specify programs. Gradual verification simplifies this process but current tools lack specification expressiveness.

Method: The authors enhance Gradual C0 by introducing unfolding expressions into the specification language to enable more intuitive treatment of recursive heap data structures.

Result: The updated Gradual C0 supports intuitive specification for recursive heap structures without losing verification capabilities.

Conclusion: The extension to Gradual C0 increases the expressiveness of its specification language, simplifying the verification of recursive heap data structures while retaining gradual verification benefits.

Abstract: Static verification provides strong correctness guarantees for code; however,
fully specifying programs for static verification is a complex, burdensome
process for users. Gradual verification was introduced to make this process
easier by supporting the verification of partially specified programs. The only
currently working gradual verifier, Gradual C0, successfully verifies heap
manipulating programs, but lacks expressiveness in its specification language.
This paper describes the design and implementation of an extension to Gradual
C0 that supports unfolding expressions, which allow more intuitive
specifications of recursive heap data structures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdapTT, a type theory focusing on functorial type formers and adapters, facilitating systematic type casting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the pervasive behavior of functoriality in type formers and systematize type casting in dependent type theories.

Method: Developing AdapTT, a new type theory based on functorial type formers and abstract adapters to study type casting systematically.

Result: The paper derives structural laws for type casts on inductive type formers using AdapTT.

Conclusion: AdapTT provides a precise framework to understand and implement type casting through functorial type formers and adapters.

Abstract: The ability to cast values between related types is a leitmotiv of many
flavors of dependent type theory, such as observational type theories,
subtyping, or cast calculi for gradual typing. These casts all exhibit a common
structural behavior that boils down to the pervasive functoriality of type
formers. We propose and extensively study a type theory, called AdapTT, which
makes systematic and precise this idea of functorial type formers, with respect
to an abstract notion of adapters relating types. Leveraging descriptions for
functorial inductive types in AdapTT, we derive structural laws for type casts
on general inductive type formers.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper enhances the lambda calculus with resource-aware semantics and type systems to ensure resources are neither wasted nor exhausted in well-typed programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the need for a computation model where resource usage is explicitly tracked and managed, ensuring that well-typed programs do not face situations like resource wastage or exhaustion.

Method: The paper extends the semantics and type system of lambda calculus to track resource usage and ensure correctness. It incorporates a grade algebra to model resource usage and employs coinductive reasoning techniques to handle the complexities of the big-step semantics and prove soundness.

Result: The extended system guarantees that well-typed programs avoid both resource exhaustion and wastage.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that resource-awareness can be seamlessly integrated into lambda calculus without modifying the core language and provides formal proofs ensuring correct resource management.

Abstract: We extend the semantics and type system of a lambda calculus equipped with
common constructs to be resource-aware. That is, the semantics keep tracks of
the usage of resources, and is stuck, besides in case of type errors, if either
a needed resource is exhausted, or a provided resource would be wasted. In such
way, the type system guarantees, besides standard soundness, that for
well-typed programs there is a computation where no resource gets either
exhausted or wasted.
  The no-waste extension is parametric on an arbitrary grade algebra, modeling
an arbitrary assortment of possible usages, and does not require ad-hoc changes
to the underlying language. To this end, the semantics needs to be formalized
in big-step style; as a consequence, expressing and proving (resource-aware)
soundness is challenging, and is achieved by applying recent techniques based
on coinductive reasoning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of mechanical failure in compliant mechanisms and proposes a hard-stop design optimizing motion limits to improve safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compliant mechanisms are limited by their susceptibility to fatigue and failure in uncertain service environments, and current hard-stop designs are too restrictive in multi-DOF spaces.

Method: The study introduces a framework for designing compact coupled multi-DOF hard stops, optimizing contact surface geometry to enhance working space and stay within the elastic regime.

Result: The method was applied to a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopedic implants, with numerical and experimental validation confirming the improved protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling.

Conclusion: The findings establish a foundation for designing precision hard stops in compliant systems, enabling their use in real-world applications under uncertain load conditions.

Abstract: Compliant mechanisms have significant potential in precision applications due
to their ability to guide motion without contact. However, an inherent
vulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of
compliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly
challenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and
the cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical
to prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on
stacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to
guarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a
systematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in
compliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a
single pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a
theoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry
to maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that
the mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method
to a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and
provide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers
reliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling. This work
establishes a foundation for precision hard-stop design in compliant systems
operating under uncertain loads, which is a crucial step toward enabling the
application of compliant mechanisms in real-world systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper describes the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge, which facilitates the detection of errors in LLM-driven conversational robots using a multimodal dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical problem of detecting and addressing errors in LLM-powered conversational robots to prevent conversation breakdowns and maintain user trust.

Method: A multimodal dataset is provided for benchmarking machine learning models designed to detect robot failures. The dataset contains annotations and features including facial, speech, and head movement data.

Result: Participants are invited to create models to identify errors in robot behavior, which will be evaluated using performance metrics like detection accuracy and false positive rates.

Conclusion: The challenge contributes to advancing failure detection in human-robot interaction by leveraging social signal analysis through machine learning models.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots
has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered
conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user
intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether.
Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing
conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user
trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal
dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot
conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models
designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic
human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement
features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot
errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for
a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are
invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these
failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various
performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This
challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in
human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

### [220] [SCOPE for Hexapod Gait Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13539)
*Jim O'Connor,Jay B. Nash,Derin Gezgin,Gary B. Parker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE), which utilizes Discrete Cosine Transform to reduce input dimensionality for hexapod robot gait learning, achieving notable performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of performance degradation in evolutionary algorithms as input space complexity increases, leading to exponential growth in solution space.

Method: SCOPE leverages the Discrete Cosine Transform to compress input dimensionality by focusing on high-energy features while discarding less significant information, which is used to evolve policies for robot gait learning.

Result: By incorporating SCOPE, the input size for hexapod gait learning was reduced by 98% (from 2700 to 54), leading to a 20% improvement in performance within the evolutionary learning process.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively reduces input dimensionality while maintaining crucial information, improving the efficacy of evolutionary algorithms for complex tasks like robotic gait learning.

Abstract: Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning
method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these
algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space
becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the
solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more
complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input
matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce
the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of
the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using
SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a
matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are
then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the
addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.
SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series
pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of
compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension
is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates
that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an
evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.

Motivation: Enhance user interaction and performance in teleoperation by incorporating force feedback and force data in data collection and learning models.

Method: Implemented force feedback and data integration into the GELLO teleoperation system using a Franka Panda arm, conducted user studies, and trained policies with and without force input.

Result: Users preferred the developed system, and force inputs significantly enhanced the success rate in dexterous manipulation tasks across simulated and real settings.

Conclusion: Integrating force data into teleoperation systems improves user experience and task performance, validating the proposed system for practical use cases.

Abstract: In this work we extend the low-cost GELLO teleoperation system, initially
designed for joint position control, with additional force information. Our
first extension is to implement force feedback, allowing users to feel
resistance when interacting with the environment. Our second extension is to
add force information into the data collection process and training of
imitation learning models. We validate our additions by implementing these on a
GELLO system with a Franka Panda arm as the follower robot, performing a user
study, and comparing the performance of policies trained with and without force
information on a range of simulated and real dexterous manipulation tasks.
Qualitatively, users with robotics experience preferred our controller, and the
addition of force inputs improved task success on the majority of tasks.

*Minze Li,Wei Zhao,Ran Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces PE-PSO, an enhanced real-time trajectory planner for UAVs using improved PSO techniques with a multi-agent framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of real-time trajectory planning in UAVs, such as computational demands, premature convergence, and latency in dynamic environments.

Method: The paper presents PE-PSO with a persistent exploration strategy and entropy-based parameter adjustment. UAV trajectories are modeled with B-splines, and a multi-agent framework combines GA-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO.

Result: Simulations show that PE-PSO outperforms traditional PSO and other methods in trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PE-PSO is effective and scalable for real-time multi-UAV operations, proving its utility in complex environments.

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic
environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the
need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with
premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory
planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve
swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to
dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using
B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization
complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent
framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with
distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation.
The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized
control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining
real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across
several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle
avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and
applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex
environmental conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robotic system to perform capsule cleaning to address secondary cataract complications, focusing on improved visualization and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To manage secondary cataract complications and improve the precision and safety of capsule cleaning procedures by overcoming visualization challenges.

Method: The system integrates a transpupillary optical coherence tomography probe and robotic precision for real-time capsule mapping and tool-to-tissue distance feedback, combined with in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset.

Result: Experimental trials on an eye phantom showed reduced errors in capsule modeling, and trials on ex-vivo pig eyes demonstrated effective cleaning without tissue damage.

Conclusion: The robotic system provides a novel, safe, and accurate solution for capsule cleaning in secondary cataract treatments, offering enhanced visualization and precision.

Abstract: Secondary cataract is one of the most common complications of vision loss due
to the proliferation of residual lens materials that naturally grow on the lens
capsule after cataract surgery. A potential treatment is capsule cleaning, a
surgical procedure that requires enhanced visualization of the entire capsule
and tool manipulation on the thin membrane. This article presents a robotic
system capable of performing the capsule cleaning procedure by integrating a
standard transpupillary and an intraocular optical coherence tomography probe
on a surgical instrument for equatorial capsule visualization and real-time
tool-to-tissue distance feedback. Using robot precision, the developed system
enables complete capsule mapping in the pupillary and equatorial regions with
in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset, which are still
current challenges in obtaining an accurate capsule model. To demonstrate
effectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five
experimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square
errors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was
performed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how different control modes and scaling factors impact performance in robotic-assisted vitreoretinal surgery to improve surgical efficiency, accuracy, and reduce risks.

Method: Using the IRISS system's console adapted to a VR headset, experienced surgeons and engineers completed simulated intraocular tasks at varying control modes and scaling factors.

Result: Inside Control methods at higher scaling factors (20 or 30) yielded the best overall performance, although the optimal scaling depended on the specific task and complexity.

Conclusion: Optimizing control methods and scaling factors can significantly enhance surgical efficiency and accuracy, contributing to safer robotic-assisted intraocular procedures in the future.

Abstract: This paper examines the performance of Inside and Outside Control modes at
various scaling factors in a simulated vitreoretinal surgical setting. The
IRISS teleoperated surgical system's console (cockpit) was adapted to project a
simulated microscope view of an intraocular setup to a virtual reality (VR)
headset. Five experienced vitreoretinal surgeons and five engineers with no
surgical experience used the system to perform tasks common to vitreoretinal
surgery. Experimental results indicate that Inside Control methods at higher
scaling factors (20 or 30) achieved the best performance overall, though the
optimal scaling factor may vary by task and complexity. Optimizing control
methods and scaling factors could lead to improvements in surgical efficiency
and accuracy, as well as minimize risks in future robotic-assisted intraocular

TL;DR: This paper proposes a scalable control method for legged robots, integrating Iterative Learning Control with a torque library to improve locomotion across diverse tasks and environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in robotic locomotion include trajectory tracking under changing conditions, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances. A framework integrating learning and biological inspiration improves adaptability.

Method: The paper combines Iterative Learning Control and a torque library for accurate trajectory tracking, leveraging periodic gaits and extending learning to nonperiodic tasks. It integrates physics-based models with real-time learning.

Result: Experimental validation on robots Cassie (bipedal) and A1 (quadrupedal) shows reduced joint tracking errors up to 85%, fast adaptability, and robust locomotion in difficult terrains.

Conclusion: Integrating learning with muscle-memory-inspired controls offers efficient, adaptive solutions for robotic locomotion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and adaptive control framework for legged
robots that integrates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a biologically
inspired torque library (TL), analogous to muscle memory. The proposed method
addresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory
tracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the
repetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the
framework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion
scenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based
model derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time
learning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A
central contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned
control profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and
gravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and
significantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the
bipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations
and hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework
reduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables
reliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope
traversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body
controllers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation
during execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of
existing methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating ILC
with torque memory as a highly data-efficient and practical solution for legged
locomotion in unstructured and dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces SaWa-ML, a novel multi-robot localization method using UWB sensors and adaptive weights to mitigate long-term drift errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in multi-robot localization, particularly the drift caused by accumulated errors in odometry estimates.

Method: The method uses UWB sensor data to correct relative positions and adaptive weight design for pose correction based on individual sensor characteristics.

Result: Real-world experiments demonstrate significant improvements in performance compared to existing multi-robot localization methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging UWB sensors and geometric structure-aware corrections enhances reliability and accuracy in multi-robot localization.

Abstract: Multi-robot localization is a crucial task for implementing multi-robot
systems. Numerous researchers have proposed optimization-based multi-robot
localization methods that use camera, IMU, and UWB sensors. Nevertheless,
characteristics of individual robot odometry estimates and distance
measurements between robots used in the optimization are not sufficiently
considered. In addition, previous researches were heavily influenced by the
odometry accuracy that is estimated from individual robots. Consequently,
long-term drift error caused by error accumulation is potentially inevitable.
In this paper, we propose a novel visual-inertial-range-based multi-robot
localization method, named SaWa-ML, which enables geometric structure-aware
pose correction and weight adaptation-based robust multi-robot localization.
Our contributions are twofold: (i) we leverage UWB sensor data, whose range
error does not accumulate over time, to first estimate the relative positions
between robots and then correct the positions of each robot, thus reducing
long-term drift errors, (ii) we design adaptive weights for robot pose
correction by considering the characteristics of the sensor data and
visual-inertial odometry estimates. The proposed method has been validated in
real-world experiments, showing a substantial performance increase compared
with state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to augment traffic scenarios for autonomous driving using natural language descriptions, utilizing a cost-effective LLM-agent design, and addressing scalability and fine-grained control issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Testing autonomous driving systems for rare scenarios is challenging because collecting real-world data or manually creating scenarios involves significant effort and resources.

Method: The authors developed an LLM-agent based framework that augments real-world traffic scenarios using natural language input, while allowing fine-grained control and performing well even with smaller LLM models.

Result: The proposed framework, evaluated by human experts, generates augmented traffic scenarios that align with user intent and achieve quality comparable to manually created scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, cost-effective, and high-quality approach to creating challenging traffic scenarios for autonomous driving evaluation, surpassing traditional manual methods.

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and
evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving
scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While
automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models
require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the
output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a
distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the
validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep
this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting
original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual
augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet
the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,
this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting
real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing
the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic
design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high
performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert
evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user
intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created
manually.

Conclusion: This framework offers a data-efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing safe visuomotor policies, alleviating the dependence on extensive supervised labeling.

Abstract: Synthesising safe controllers from visual data typically requires extensive

Motivation: Autonomous aerial systems encounter challenges like abrupt control mode switching, system delays, and errors during airdrop missions, requiring innovative solutions.

Method: The paper introduces an aerial manipulator with additional actuated degrees of freedom for tracking error compensation, smooth trajectory design for payload release, and a hierarchical disturbance compensation in NMPC.

Result: Through simulations and real-world experiments, the system demonstrated enhanced agility, precision, and robustness in airdrop operations.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively improves the performance of autonomous airdrop missions by mitigating control errors and optimizing trajectory execution.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems play an increasingly vital role in a wide range of
applications, particularly for transport and delivery tasks in complex
environments. In airdrop missions, these platforms face the dual challenges of
abrupt control mode switching and inherent system delays along with control
errors. To address these issues, this paper presents an autonomous airdrop
system based on an aerial manipulator (AM). The introduction of additional
actuated degrees of freedom enables active compensation for UAV tracking
errors. By imposing smooth and continuous constraints on the parabolic landing
point, the proposed approach generates aerial throwing trajectories that are
less sensitive to the timing of payload release. A hierarchical disturbance
compensation strategy is incorporated into the Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (NMPC) framework to mitigate the effects of sudden changes in system
parameters, while the predictive capabilities of NMPC are further exploited to
improve the precision of aerial throwing. Both simulation and real-world
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves greater
agility and precision in airdrop missions.

Conclusion: Neural HJR shows promise in solving decentralized MAMP tasks, offering scalability, safety, and real-time capabilities across complex conditions and systems.

Abstract: Safe Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is a significant challenge in
robotics. Despite substantial advancements, existing methods often face a
dilemma. Decentralized algorithms typically rely on predicting the behavior of
other agents, sharing contracts, or maintaining communication for safety, while
centralized approaches struggle with scalability and real-time decision-making.
To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability
Learning (HJR) for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning. Our method
provides scalable neural HJR modeling to tackle high-dimensional configuration
spaces and capture worst-case collision and safety constraints between agents.
We further propose a decentralized trajectory optimization framework that
incorporates the learned HJR solutions to solve MAMP tasks in real-time. We
demonstrate that our method is both scalable and data-efficient, enabling the
solution of MAMP problems in higher-dimensional scenarios with complex
collision constraints. Our approach generalizes across various dynamical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies revealed challenges in multitask self-aggregation, such as non-compact circular formations and limited autonomy.

Method: The authors developed a behavior for homogeneous robots utilizing a line-of-sight sensor to autonomously form compact clusters in multitask environments.

Result: Simulation trials demonstrated scalability across different configurations, achieving compact formations while maintaining clustering efficiency.

Conclusion: Their approach enhances multitask self-aggregation performance, proving both scalable and effective in enhancing cluster compactness.

Abstract: The deployment of simple emergent behaviors in swarm robotics has been
well-rehearsed in the literature. A recent study has shown how self-aggregation
is possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task
instances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach
poses new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the
performance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of
robots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully
compact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask
self-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into
different compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our
multitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a
compact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation
trials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of
robots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation
behavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the
proportion of clustered robots found in other studies.

is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO
suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local
optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy
Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random
disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting
trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight
strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with
flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the
local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a
position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,
effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.
Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test
functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms
across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its
advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path
planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are
still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we
apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design
problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental
results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of
solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for
application.

TL;DR: Edge VLA (EVLA) improves inference speed and memory efficiency of Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) on edge devices, while maintaining comparable training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in robotics hinders the development of generalizable visuomotor policies, necessitating efficient Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

Method: EVLA eliminates autoregressive position predictions for faster inference and uses Small Language Models (SLMs) for reduced computational costs.

Result: EVLA demonstrates a 7x speedup in inference with training comparable to OpenVLA, while being more memory and computational efficient.

Conclusion: EVLA offers a practical solution for deploying Vision-Language-Action models on resource-constrained systems, promoting real-time edge device performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while
enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

*Tianyuan Wang,Mark A Post,Mathieu Deremetz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of the STARFAB Mobile Inspection Module (MIM), an autonomous robotic unit for inspecting and maintaining orbital warehouses in the commercial space ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fully autonomous systems in managing and maintaining orbital warehouses as part of the "New Space" ecosystem.

Method: The MIM is designed to be a modular, independently-mobile robot equipped with high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, thermal imaging sensors, and other inspection tools. It can be carried and operated by Walking Manipulators.

Result: The system design, including the mechanical, electronic, and sensor components, is detailed, though implementation and testing are still ongoing.

Conclusion: The MIM represents a significant step forward in achieving autonomous orbital inspection and maintenance, demonstrating the feasibility of such systems.

Abstract: The use of autonomous robots in space is an essential part of the "New Space"
commercial ecosystem of assembly and re-use of space hardware components in
Earth orbit and beyond. The STARFAB project aims to create a ground
demonstration of an orbital automated warehouse as a hub for sustainable
commercial operations and servicing. A critical part of this fully-autonomous
robotic facility will be the capability to monitor, inspect, and assess the
condition of both the components stored in the warehouse, and the STARFAB
facility itself. This paper introduces ongoing work on the STARFAB Mobile
Inspection Module (MIM). The MIM uses Standard Interconnects (SI) so that it
can be carried by Walking Manipulators (WM) as an independently-mobile robot,
and multiple MIMs can be stored and retrieved as needed for operations on
STARFAB. The MIM carries high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, and a
thermal imaging sensor, with the capability to add other modular sensors. A
grasping tool and torque wrench are stored within the modular body for use by
an attached WM for maintenance operations. Implementation and testing is still
ongoing at the time of writing. This paper details the concept of operations
for the MIM as an on-orbit autonomous inspection and maintenance system, the
mechanical and electronic design of the MIM, and the sensors package used for
non-destructive testing.

*Nataliya Nechyporenko,Yutong Zhang,Sean Campbell,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MorphIt is an algorithm that allows robots to adapt their physical form for various tasks by using spherical primitives, enhancing functionality while balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most robotic systems treat their physical geometry as a fixed parameter, which limits their adaptability across diverse tasks.

Method: MorphIt uses an automatic gradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters to approximate robot morphology using spherical primitives.

Result: MorphIt outperformed existing methods in mesh approximation, sphere efficiency, and computational cost reduction, improving capabilities for collision detection, interaction simulation, and navigation.

Conclusion: By allowing adaptive morphological representation, MorphIt enables robots to exploit their physical form as an active resource, enhancing performance and adaptability in various environments.

Abstract: What if a robot could rethink its own morphological representation to better
meet the demands of diverse tasks? Most robotic systems today treat their
physical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing
the same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly
different computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a
novel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives
that balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or
inflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic
gradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides
explicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline
approaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis
Approximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation
with fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show
enhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich
interaction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces. By dynamically
adapting geometric representations to task requirements, robots can now exploit
their physical embodiment as an active resource rather than an inflexible
parameter, opening new frontiers for manipulation in environments where
physical form must continuously balance precision with computational
tractability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner that combines heuristic motion space and Bayesian Networks to optimize underwater robot motion planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of current motion planning methods in underwater environments, specifically their inability to efficiently utilize prior experiences and adapt to real-time uncertainties.

Method: The framework integrates Heuristic Motion Space (HMS) using the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) algorithm and employs Bayesian Networks for dynamic uncertainty updates.

Result: The proposed method demonstrated enhanced performance, computational efficiency, and robustness in simulations and real-world underwater scenarios.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach improves autonomous underwater robots' motion planning capabilities, optimizing performance in dynamic marine environments.

Abstract: Autonomous motion planning is critical for efficient and safe underwater
manipulation in dynamic marine environments. Current motion planning methods
often fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to
real-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we
introduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a
Heuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning
for autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic
Roadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite
cost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and
execution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the
search space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time
planning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update
uncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental
conditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through
extensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages
of our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness. This
probabilistic approach significantly advances the capability of autonomous
underwater robots, ensuring optimized motion planning in the face of dynamic
marine challenges.

### [239] [Socio-Technical Smell Dynamics in Code Samples: A Multivocal Review on Emergence, Evolution, and Co-Occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13481)
*Arthur Bueno,Bruno Cafeo,Maria Cagnin,Awdren Fontão*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code samples in open-source ecosystems often face socio-technical degradation due to informal governance and lack of review, with community dysfunctions preceding technical anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the underexplored interplay between community and code smells in open-source code samples, which affects maintainability and usability.

Method: A Multivocal Literature Review protocol was used, analyzing 30 peer-reviewed and 17 practitioner-oriented sources to synthesize socio-technical patterns.

Result: Nine socio-technical patterns were identified, showing that community smells like 'radio silence' and centralized ownership often lead to technical issues over time.

Conclusion: Community dysfunctions in OSSECO code samples often signal more profound technical decay, emphasizing the need for better governance and socio-technical quality indicators.

Abstract: Code samples play a pivotal role in open-source ecosystems (OSSECO), serving
as lightweight artifacts that support knowledge transfer, onboarding, and
framework adoption. Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are
often governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which
increases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the
co-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,
poor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented
communication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been
studied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions
anticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This
study investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve
within code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review
protocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17
practitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to
identify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine
patterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or
reinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as "radio
silence" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent
structural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of
continuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring
conditions for smell accumulation. Conclusion: In OSSECOs, particularly within
code samples, community-level dysfunctions not only correlate with but often
signal maintainability decay. These findings underscore the need for
socio-technical quality indicators and lightweight governance mechanisms
tailored to shared instructional artifacts.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Meta developed MetaMateCR, an AI tool for code review, to provide fixes for reviewer comments using fine-tuned Llama models. Production trials ensured the tool doesn’t delay reviews, ultimately improving patch adoption rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of processing tens of thousands of code review comments weekly at Meta, an AI-assisted system was developed to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The paper fine-tuned Llama models on a large dataset of 64k code review instances. It tested their performance offline and used randomized trials and production experiments to ensure the system’s reliability and minimal disruption.

Result: The LargeLSFT model achieved a 68% exact match rate, outperforming GPT-4o by 9pp offline. Production trials showed a 19.7% ActionableToApplied rate, a 9.2pp enhancement over GPT-4o.

Conclusion: MetaMateCR successfully assists code reviews without negatively impacting review time, emphasizing the importance of safety trials and optimization for deploying AI at scale.

Abstract: Aim. There are 10s of thousands of code review comments each week at Meta. We
developed Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes
for reviewer comments in production at scale.
  Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k <review comment, patch>
data points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable
offline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted
fixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct
randomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.
  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large
Llama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match
patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The
internal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP
functions suggested by GPT-4o.
  Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that
compares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression
with reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews. After investigation,
we modify the UX to only show authors the AI patches, and see no regressions in
the time for reviews.
  Production. When we roll LargeLSFT into production, we see an
ActionableToApplied rate of 19.7%, which is a 9.2pp improvement over GPT-4o.
Our results illustrate the importance of safety trials in ensuring that AI does
not inadvertently slow down engineers, and a successful review comment to AI
patch product running at scale.

### [241] [Towards Better Requirements from the Crowd: Developer Engagement with Feature Requests in Open Source Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13553)
*Pragyan K C,Rambod Ghandiparsi,Thomas Herron,John Heaps,Mitra Bokaei Hosseini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper examines how developers handle ambiguous and incomplete feature requests in open-source software (OSS) development, finding that clarification processes are rare and typically focus on user intent rather than technical details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity and incomplete information in natural-language feature requests can lead to misinterpretation, faulty implementations, and reduced software quality. The goal is to study how developers handle clarification to address these issues.

Method: The study investigates feature requests on open-source software platforms, analyzing their ambiguity or incompleteness and studying the conversational dynamics of clarification between users and developers.

Result: It finds that feature requests on OSS platforms are often ambiguous or incomplete. Clarification is rare, and when it happens, it prioritizes understanding user intent and feasibility rather than resolving unclear text or technical details.

Conclusion: This work highlights the need for better user-developer collaboration and offers insights into practices that could improve the handling of feature requests in open-source projects.

Abstract: As user demands evolve, effectively incorporating feature requests is crucial
for maintaining software relevance and user satisfaction. Feature requests,
typically expressed in natural language, often suffer from ambiguity or
incomplete information due to communication gaps or the requester's limited
technical expertise. These issues can lead to misinterpretation, faulty
implementation, and reduced software quality. While seeking clarification from
requesters is a common strategy to mitigate these risks, little is known about
how developers engage in this clarification process in practice-how they
formulate clarifying questions, seek technical or contextual details, align on
goals and use cases, or decide to close requests without attempting
clarification. This study investigates how feature requests are prone to NL
defects (i.e. ambiguous or incomplete) and the conversational dynamics of
clarification in open-source software (OSS) development, aiming to understand
how developers handle ambiguous or incomplete feature requests. Our findings
suggest that feature requests published on the OSS platforms do possess
ambiguity and incompleteness, and in some cases, both. We also find that
explicit clarification for the resolution of these defects is uncommon;
developers usually focus on aligning with project goals rather than resolving
unclear text. When clarification occurs, it emphasizes understanding user
intent/goal and feasibility, rather than technical details. By characterizing
the dynamics of clarification in open-source issue trackers, this work
identifies patterns that can improve user-developer collaboration and inform
best practices for handling feature requests effectively.

*Pragyan K C,Rambod Ghandiparsi,Thomas Herron,John Heaps,Mitra Bokaei Hosseini*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study introduces a method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and refine defects in user-provided feature requests written in natural language, with a focus on open-source software platforms like GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of the software industry and evolving requirements, driven by user feature requests, often suffer from defects like ambiguity and incompleteness, requiring solutions for better handling, especially in decentralized OSS environments.

Method: The paper uses LLMs to automate defect detection in feature requests, generate clarification questions, and evaluates their effectiveness through real-world OSS applications and comparison against human annotations. Additionally, developer interviews were conducted to examine perceptions and strategies related to NL defects.

Result: The proposed LLM-based approach successfully detects defects in NL feature requests and generates clarification questions, showing promising results when compared with human annotations. Insights from developer interviews provided additional understanding of handling defects in OSS environments.

Conclusion: The method enhances the quality and usefulness of user feature requests for developers in decentralized OSS settings by detecting NL defects and generating clarifications, contributing to better downstream SE tasks.

Abstract: The growing popularity and widespread use of software applications (apps)
across various domains have driven rapid industry growth. Along with this
growth, fast-paced market changes have led to constantly evolving software
requirements. Such requirements are often grounded in feature requests and
enhancement suggestions, typically provided by users in natural language (NL).
However, these requests often suffer from defects such as ambiguity and
incompleteness, making them challenging to interpret. Traditional validation
methods (e.g., interviews and workshops) help clarify such defects but are
impractical in decentralized environments like open-source software (OSS),
where change requests originate from diverse users on platforms like GitHub.
This paper proposes a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to
detect and refine NL defects in feature requests. Our approach automates the
identification of ambiguous and incomplete requests and generates clarification
questions (CQs) to enhance their usefulness for developers. To evaluate its
effectiveness, we apply our method to real-world OSS feature requests and
compare its performance against human annotations. In addition, we conduct
interviews with GitHub developers to gain deeper insights into their
perceptions of NL defects, the strategies they use to address these defects,
and the impact of defects on downstream software engineering (SE) tasks.

### [243] [Testing Autonomous Driving Systems -- What Really Matters and What Doesn't](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13661)
*Changwen Li,Joseph Sifakis,Rongjie Yan,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper identifies critical flaws in current autonomous driving systems (ADS) testing methods and proposes a comparison framework, highlighting the necessity for rationality and determinacy in autopilot design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified approach to testing ADS hinders a clear technical assessment of existing methods' effectiveness and validity.

Method: The paper presents a comparative framework for evaluating test methods' effectiveness and investigates autopilot properties like rationality and determinacy.

Result: Findings reveal that many test methods fail to assess ADS properly because they are either inefficient or invalid, producing unrealistic scenarios or relying on unfounded assumptions.

Conclusion: Current ADS testing cannot reliably ensure autopilot safety and functionality; thus, future designs should prioritize rationality and determinacy in order to create effective testing mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite extensive research, the testing of autonomous driving systems (ADS)
landscape remains fragmented, and there is currently no basis for an informed
technical assessment of the importance and contribution of the current state of
the art. This paper attempts to address this problem by exploring two
complementary aspects.
  First, it proposes a framework for comparing existing test methods in terms
of their intrinsic effectiveness and validity. It shows that many methods do
not meet both of these requirements. Either because they are based on criteria
that do not allow for rapid, inexpensive, and comprehensive detection of
failures, or because the degree of validity of the properties tested cannot be
accurately estimated. In particular, it is shown that most critical test
methods do not take into account the nominal operational capabilities of
autopilots and generate scenarios that are impossible for the tested vehicles
to handle, resulting in unjustified rejections.
  Secondly, the paper shows that test effectiveness and validity are highly
dependent on how autopilots are designed: how they choose between different
control policies to perform maneuvers, as well as on the reproducibility of the
results. In fact, most test methods take for granted two principles underlying
traditional methods, but do not generally apply to ADS. We maintain that the
absence of rationality and determinacy significantly impairs the effectiveness
and validity of test methods, and provide test results on eight open
autopilots, in which most do not satisfy these properties, thereby illustrating
this fact.
  We conclude that under the current state of the art, it is impossible to
obtain strong enough guarantees for essential autopilot properties and
recommend that autopilots be developed with a view to both rationality and
determinacy.

*Sen Lu,Xiaoyu Zhang,Mingtao Hu,Eric Yeu-Jer Lee,Soohyeon Kim,Wei D. Lu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper introduces State-Space Models (SSMs) as a framework to bridge microscale neural circuits with cognitive functions, demonstrating their potential in tasks requiring temporal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between neuronal connectivity/biophysics and their role in producing flexible, learned cognitive behaviors.

Method: Using the S5 model variant of SSMs trained on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement learning to analyze emergent neural behaviors.

Result: The neural representations developed in the model mimic biological 'time cells' and reproduce phenomena like ramping activity, oscillations/traveling waves, and event counting.

Conclusion: SSMs provide a computationally tractable and unifying framework linking neuron dynamics with cognitive phenomena, enabling better understanding of temporal learning mechanisms in the brain.

Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the
detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and a mechanistic understanding
of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal
connectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements
combine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a
framework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep
learning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential
equations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the
biophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead
to emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this
framework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal
state transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement
learning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural
representations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that
these cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational
dynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism
unifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and
oscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we
show that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative
tasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for
performing complex cognitive tasks. Our findings position SSMs as a compelling
framework that connects single-neuron dynamics to cognitive phenomena, offering
a unifying and computationally tractable theoretical ground for temporal
learning in the brain.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores how visual perception is shaped by investigating the shared principles governing neural responses to stimuli across humans and deep neural networks (DNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand whether visual perception is shaped more by external environmental structures or by the brain's internal organization, particularly focusing on the shared principles in representational transformations.

Method: The study combines inter-subject similarity and alignment with model hierarchies through a unified framework, analyzing three independent fMRI datasets on visual scene perception.

Result: Researchers identified a cortex-wide network conserved across individuals, divided into two pathways (medial-ventral for scene structure and lateral-dorsal for social/biological content), aligned with the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that both humans and artificial vision systems converge on a computationally similar solution for visual encoding, influenced primarily by the structure of the external world.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

*Nikola Pavlovic,Sudeep Salgia,Qing Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentially private algorithm for contextual kernel bandits with stochastic contexts, achieving state-of-the-art cumulative regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of ensuring differential privacy in contextual kernel bandits while preserving performance in terms of cumulative regret.

Method: A novel algorithm is developed using a private kernel-ridge regression estimator. This combines private covariance estimation and private random projections to reduce sensitivity while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Result: The algorithm achieves cumulative regret of approximately $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_T T} + \frac{\gamma_T}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_T T} + \frac{\gamma_T \sqrt{T}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$ in joint and local privacy models, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers theoretical guarantees for achieving differential privacy in contextual kernel bandits without compromising on performance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual kernel bandits with stochastic
contexts, where the underlying reward function belongs to a known Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space. We study this problem under an additional constraint of
Differential Privacy, where the agent needs to ensure that the sequence of
query points is differentially private with respect to both the sequence of
contexts and rewards. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves the
state-of-the-art cumulative regret of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$
and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T\sqrt{T}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$
over a time horizon of $T$ in the joint and local models of differential
privacy, respectively, where $\gamma_T$ is the effective dimension of the
kernel and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}} > 0$ is the privacy parameter. The key
ingredient of the proposed algorithm is a novel private kernel-ridge regression
estimator which is based on a combination of private covariance estimation and
private random projections. It offers a significantly reduced sensitivity
compared to its classical counterpart while maintaining a high prediction
accuracy, allowing our algorithm to achieve the state-of-the-art performance
guarantees.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for data sharing in machine learning that identifies quality external data agents without relying on prior assumptions, using conformal data contamination tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of quality local data in machine learning motivates sourcing from external agents. Ensuring the quality of this external data is a critical concern.

Method: Proposed distribution-free testing procedures, termed conformal data contamination tests, based on conformal outlier detection. The tests facilitate false discovery rate control using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

Result: Demonstrated robustness and effectiveness across collaborative learning scenarios, with the framework reliably identifying valuable external data.

Conclusion: The conformal data contamination test provides a reliable and generic solution for aggregating external data while ensuring quality through statistically rigorous guarantees.

Abstract: The amount of quality data in many machine learning tasks is limited to what
is available locally to data owners. The set of quality data can be expanded
through trading or sharing with external data agents. However, data buyers need
quality guarantees before purchasing, as external data may be contaminated or
irrelevant to their specific learning task. Previous works primarily rely on
distributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality
checks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose
a distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies
external data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization. To
achieve this, we introduce novel two-sample testing procedures, grounded in
rigorous theoretical foundations for conformal outlier detection, to determine
whether an agent's data exceeds a contamination threshold. The proposed tests,
termed conformal data contamination tests, remain valid under arbitrary
contamination levels while enabling false discovery rate control via the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Empirical evaluations across diverse
collaborative learning scenarios demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our approach. Overall, the conformal data contamination test distinguishes
itself as a generic procedure for aggregating data with statistically rigorous
quality guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the intrinsic dimension of high-dimensional datasets is crucial for assessing their complexity and suitability for machine learning tasks.

Method: The authors categorize dimension estimation methods based on geometric information—tangential structure, parametric inference, and topological/metric invariants—and evaluate their robustness and accuracy under various conditions.

Result: Evaluation reveals varying responses of dimension estimators to curvature, noise, hyperparameter sensitivity, sample size, high dimensions, and non-linear geometries.

Conclusion: Many dimension estimators are prone to overfitting and lack generalizability beyond tested datasets, suggesting the need for better guidelines and improvements in their design.

Abstract: It is a standard assumption that datasets in high dimension have an internal
structure which means that they in fact lie on, or near, subsets of a lower
dimension. In many instances it is important to understand the real dimension
of the data, hence the complexity of the dataset at hand. A great variety of
dimension estimators have been developed to find the intrinsic dimension of the
data but there is little guidance on how to reliably use these estimators.
  This survey reviews a wide range of dimension estimation methods,
categorising them by the geometric information they exploit: tangential
estimators which detect a local affine structure; parametric estimators which
rely on dimension-dependent probability distributions; and estimators which use
topological or metric invariants.
  The paper evaluates the performance of these methods, as well as
investigating varying responses to curvature and noise. Key issues addressed
include robustness to hyperparameter selection, sample size requirements,
accuracy in high dimensions, precision, and performance on non-linear
geometries. In identifying the best hyperparameters for benchmark datasets,
overfitting is frequent, indicating that many estimators may not generalise
well beyond the datasets on which they have been tested.

### [249] [Conformalized Regression for Continuous Bounded Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14023)
*Zhanli Wu,Fabrizio Leisen,F. Javier Rubio*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes methods for creating conformal prediction intervals tailored for regression problems involving bounded continuous outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in predictive accuracy for bounded outcomes, particularly rates and proportions, in regression problems.

Method: Develop conformal prediction intervals using transformation models and beta regression while introducing specific non-conformity measures to handle heteroscedasticity and model mis-specifications.

Result: Simulation studies and empirical tests validate the predictive coverage of the methods, including under scenarios of model misspecification.

Conclusion: The methods show reliability compared to alternatives, such as bootstrap-based approaches, and offer robust predictive accuracy for bounded outcomes.

Abstract: Regression problems with bounded continuous outcomes frequently arise in
real-world statistical and machine learning applications, such as the analysis
of rates and proportions. A central challenge in this setting is predicting a
response associated with a new covariate value. Most of the existing
statistical and machine learning literature has focused either on point
prediction of bounded outcomes or on interval prediction based on asymptotic
approximations. We develop conformal prediction intervals for bounded outcomes
based on transformation models and beta regression. We introduce tailored
non-conformity measures based on residuals that are aligned with the underlying
models, and account for the inherent heteroscedasticity in regression settings
with bounded outcomes. We present a theoretical result on asymptotic marginal
and conditional validity in the context of full conformal prediction, which
remains valid under model misspecification. For split conformal prediction, we
provide an empirical coverage analysis based on a comprehensive simulation
study. The simulation study demonstrates that both methods provide valid
finite-sample predictive coverage, including settings with model
misspecification. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of the
proposed conformal prediction intervals on real data and compare them with
bootstrap-based alternatives.

*Marcel Hedman,Desi R. Ivanova,Cong Guan,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stepwise Deep Adaptive Design (Step-DAD), a semi-amortized Bayesian experimental design method that outperforms existing methods by adapting design policies during experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in fully amortized policy-based approaches in Bayesian experimental design, which lack flexibility and robustness due to fixed pre-trained policies.

Method: The authors propose Step-DAD, which trains a design policy initially and then adapts and updates it during experimental data collection, improving its alignment with the specific experiment.

Result: Step-DAD shows consistent superiority in decision-making and robustness compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian experimental design methods in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: Step-DAD's adaptive approach leads to improved flexibility, robustness, and performance in Bayesian experimental design.

Abstract: We develop a semi-amortized, policy-based, approach to Bayesian experimental
design (BED) called Stepwise Deep Adaptive Design (Step-DAD). Like existing,
fully amortized, policy-based BED approaches, Step-DAD trains a design policy
upfront before the experiment. However, rather than keeping this policy fixed,
Step-DAD periodically updates it as data is gathered, refining it to the
particular experimental instance. This test-time adaptation improves both the
flexibility and the robustness of the design strategy compared with existing
approaches. Empirically, Step-DAD consistently demonstrates superior
decision-making and robustness compared with current state-of-the-art BED
methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hybrid framework combining physics-based modeling with machine learning to accurately localize impacts and estimate forces on composite plates, enabling robust analysis even with limited experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve impact monitoring and structural health management in composite aerostructures, especially when experimental data is sparse.

Method: The framework integrates First-Order Shear Deformation Theory with supervised learning and uncertainty quantification, allowing for physics-informed data augmentation and adaptive regularization.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrated accuracy, reduced dependence on extensive training datasets, robustness, and efficiency in impact localization and force estimation.

Conclusion: This scalable and transferable framework effectively integrates physics-based modeling and machine learning for impact monitoring in composite structures, offering a robust solution for structural health management.

Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and
generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when
experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact
localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven
implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine
learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and
material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary
conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity
but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data
augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning.
Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model
improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also
accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the
force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on
composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed
method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and
structural health management in composite aerostructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if AI can transcend human limitations to discover universal ethical foundations.

Method: Developing a theoretical framework based on processing and synthesizing diverse ethical contexts.

Result: AI systems could identify moral meta-patterns beyond cultural and individual biases.

Conclusion: AI might enhance our understanding of ethics, simultaneously deepening insight into human moral reflection.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for the AI ethical resonance
hypothesis, which proposes that advanced AI systems with purposefully designed
cognitive structures ("ethical resonators") may emerge with the ability to
identify subtle moral patterns that are invisible to the human mind. The paper
explores the possibility that by processing and synthesizing large amounts of
ethical contexts, AI systems may discover moral meta-patterns that transcend
cultural, historical, and individual biases, potentially leading to a deeper
understanding of universal ethical foundations. The paper also examines a
paradoxical aspect of the hypothesis, in which AI systems could potentially
deepen our understanding of what we traditionally consider essentially human -
our capacity for ethical reflection.

TL;DR: The CHEFS database consolidates extensive EU food safety monitoring data into a unified format, enabling easier accessibility and analysis to support policy, research, and regulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the challenges posed by scattered and inaccessible EU food safety monitoring data, hindering effective analysis and policy-making.

Method: They created the CHEFS database by integrating and structuring monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal products, and chemical contaminants collected by EFSA, covering 15.2 million samples over 24 years.

Result: The unified CHEFS database revealed trends in food safety monitoring, including non-compliance rates, common contaminants, frequently tested products, and differences in monitoring efforts across countries.

Conclusion: The CHEFS database serves as an essential centralized resource to improve food safety monitoring, guide research, and inform EU-wide food safety regulations.

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by
member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and
published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived
from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food
products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze
trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the
current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling
several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this,
we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which
consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal
product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured
dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and
demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety
monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring
activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often
non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences
across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a
centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy,
research, and regulation.

### [254] [Deep Micro Solvers for Rough-Wall Stokes Flow in a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13902)
*Emanuel Ström,Anna-Karin Tornberg,Ozan Öktem*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Fourier neural operator-based method to efficiently compute effective slip lengths in rough-wall Stokes flow using learned precomputation within the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of solving microscopic flow problems repetitively in heterogeneous multiscale methods (HMM) for rough-wall Stokes flow.

Method: The authors utilize a Fourier neural operator to approximate local averages of microscopic flow, correlating the local wall geometry with Riesz representors, enabling geometry-dependent training independent of boundary conditions.

Result: The proposed approach achieves reduced computational costs for solving micro-level flow problems while maintaining accuracy comparable to classical methods. A theoretical analysis confirms bounded error propagation based on the training loss.

Conclusion: The technique provides an efficient and accurate way to simulate macroscopic flow for rough surfaces, demonstrating computational scalability and effectiveness in HMM applications.

Abstract: We propose a learned precomputation for the heterogeneous multiscale method
(HMM) for rough-wall Stokes flow. A Fourier neural operator is used to
approximate local averages over microscopic subsets of the flow, which allows
to compute an effective slip length of the fluid away from the roughness. The
network is designed to map from the local wall geometry to the Riesz
representors for the corresponding local flow averages. With such a
parameterisation, the network only depends on the local wall geometry and as
such can be trained independent of boundary conditions. We perform a detailed
theoretical analysis of the statistical error propagation, and prove that under
suitable regularity and scaling assumptions, a bounded training loss leads to a
bounded error in the resulting macroscopic flow. We then demonstrate on a
family of test problems that the learned precomputation performs stably with
respect to the scale of the roughness. The accuracy in the HMM solution for the
macroscopic flow is comparable to when the local (micro) problems are solved
using a classical approach, while the computational cost of solving the micro
problems is significantly reduced.

*Sara Avesani,Gianluca Giacchi,Michael Multerer*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper introduces a fast linear-time algorithm using samplet transform to detect local regularity in scattered multivariate data, outperforming traditional wavelet approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of traditional wavelet transforms in analyzing higher dimensional and scattered data necessitate development of robust methods for local regularity detection.

Method: The proposed method utilizes the fast samplet transform, a tailored wavelet transform for scattered data, to relate coefficient decay to signal regularity within microlocal spaces.

Result: The algorithm successfully detects regularity across diverse data types including non-uniform time series, image segmentation, and edge detection in point clouds, supported by theoretical and numerical validations.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that samplets are powerful tools for regularity analysis in both structured and unstructured high-dimensional data, offering better scalability and performance.

Abstract: Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet
coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the
local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach
quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: TexGS-VolVis enhances volume visualization with textured Gaussian splatting and enables advanced editing capabilities using 2D and pretrained large models to allow superior stylization and rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional volume visualization techniques lack flexibility in style transfer and rely on complex predefined rules, which limits their adaptability and quality.

Method: TexGS-VolVis introduces textured 2D Gaussian primitives paired with pretrained models for arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. It enables image- and text-driven scene editing and improved stylization using a segmentation method called 2D-lift-3D.

Result: This framework achieves improved visual quality, efficient rendering, and advanced editing capabilities, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: TexGS-VolVis represents a significant improvement in volume visualization by offering higher-quality stylization, better lighting control, and detailed scene editing.

Abstract: Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PHASE, a machine learning framework that distinguishes human from non-human activity in cybersecurity simulations with over 90% accuracy using network logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersecurity simulation environments lack a quantitative method to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user personas.

Method: PHASE uses passive machine learning analysis of network logs collected via Zeek appliances, combined with a DNS-based labeling approach. SHAP analysis is employed to identify human-like behavioral signatures.

Result: PHASE accurately classified human versus synthetic activity, identified non-human patterns, and informed improvements for synthetic user configurations.

Conclusion: PHASE enhances the realism of synthetic user personas in cybersecurity simulations, supporting improved simulation effectiveness and reliability.

Abstract: Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and
sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no
quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user
personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation
Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs
and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE
operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any
user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network
activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to
avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt
the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel
labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic,
thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures
indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic
user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral
realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration
that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a
more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing safety mechanisms and concept erasure methods that fail under adversarial fine-tuning attacks.

Method: GIFT formulates immunization as a bi-level optimization problem, utilizing representation noising and maximization in the upper level and preserving performance on safe data in the lower level.

Result: GIFT successfully hinders the model's ability to relearn harmful concepts while maintaining its performance on safe content.

Conclusion: The method offers a robust approach to building safer generative models resistant to adversarial fine-tuning and malicious reprogramming.

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend
diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their
ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety
checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under
adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a
bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's
ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and
maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe
data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while
maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method
significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while
maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for
creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning approaches face challenges such as high overhead and lack of confidentiality for the global model, limiting their efficacy in privacy-sensitive applications.

Method: FuSeFL employs decentralized training using lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC) and restricts the server's role to secure aggregation.

Result: The framework reduces communication latency by up to 95%, decreases server memory usage by 50%, and improves accuracy while providing robust security against inference threats.

Conclusion: FuSeFL offers a scalable and secure solution for federated learning in cross-silo deployments, addressing key limitations in existing approaches with strong efficiency and privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without
centralizing client data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains.
While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic
encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate
inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient
leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory
overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global
model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit
the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving
large datasets and strict compliance requirements.
  We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for
cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using
lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's
role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids
data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates
throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to
95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves
accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and

TL;DR: The study improves steganography by integrating Adaptive Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) with pseudorandom pixel selection, enhancing image security, capacity, and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APVD steganography faces challenges with unused blocks, which reduce security and image quality.

Method: The paper proposes combining APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to overcome unused block issues and enhance performance.

Result: The approach improves image metrics such as PSNR, UIQ, and SSIM, achieving better security and aesthetic quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances steganographic embedding across diverse images, ensuring secure data transmission without loss of visual quality.

Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly
within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive
Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,
encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can
cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to
lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy
that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate
these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing
techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation
of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with
pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics
such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),
and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods
in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a
variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby
ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of
the image.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the security vulnerabilities in deep learning (DL)-based RF fingerprinting systems and finds that these can be exploited for adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore security gaps in DL-based RF fingerprinting, as current research focuses more on improving robustness rather than addressing potential vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors perform adversarial-driven experimental analysis, focusing on DL models' behavior under domain shifts and real-world data.

Result: Results indicate that DL models misclassify devices consistently under domain shifts, which can act as a backdoor for attackers. Training DL models on raw signals introduces additional vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: RF fingerprinting systems leveraging DL models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, and existing post-processing security measures are insufficient to counteract the identified threats.

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware
imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer
device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G
networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have
primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial
variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of
these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we
systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting
systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a
consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where
a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis
based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can
be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude
into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received
signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and
signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be
mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence
thresholds.

### [265] [SEER: Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning Network for Multimodal Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13415)
*Peican Zhu,Yubo Jing,Le Cheng,Bin Chen,Xiaodong Cui,Lianwei Wu,Keke Tang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes SEER, a Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning network, for multimodal fake news detection by incorporating semantic understanding and emotional features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multimodal fake news detection neglect the potential of large multimodal models for semantic enhancement and the emotional tendencies in fake news, especially their inclination towards negativity.

Method: The SEER network generates captions for image semantics, leverages large multimodal models for semantic enhancement, and utilizes an emotional reasoning module inspired by the relationship between emotional tendencies and news authenticity.

Result: Experiments on two datasets show SEER's superiority over existing state-of-the-art multimodal fake news detection methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic enhancement and emotional reasoning significantly improves the performance of multimodal fake news detection, demonstrating SEER's effectiveness.

Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application
of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement
effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional
features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to
contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel
Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake
news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic
understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic
enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity
and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that
simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the
authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.

### [266] [A Collaborative Framework Integrating Large Language Model and Chemical Fragment Space: Mutual Inspiration for Lead Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13580)
*Hao Tuo,Yan Li,Xuanning Hu,Haishi Zhao,Xueyan Liu,Bo Yang*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: AutoLeadDesign is a framework that integrates domain knowledge with large language models and chemical fragments to explore chemical space for drug design, outperforming baseline methods and showing expert-competitive efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in combinatorial optimization for drug design struggle to integrate domain knowledge, hindering their ability to identify innovative and valid binding modes for lead compounds.

Method: AutoLeadDesign leverages chemical fragments combined with domain knowledge encoded in large language models to optimize exploration of chemical space and aid in lead compound design.

Result: Comprehensive experiments and empirical design campaigns targeting PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro confirm that AutoLeadDesign surpasses baseline methods in efficacy and generates structurally validated lead compounds.

Conclusion: AutoLeadDesign provides an efficient and expert-level solution for lead compound design, with demonstrated utility in drug discovery and mechanisms analogous to fragment-based drug design processes.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug
design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with
high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent
challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in
identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose
AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive
domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to
progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The
comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline
methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two
clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate
AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving
expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their
mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we
find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug
design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further
revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach
for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.

### [267] [Scalable Attribute-Missing Graph Clustering via Neighborhood Differentiatio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13368)
*Yaowen Hu,Wenxuan Tu,Yue Liu,Xinhang Wan,Junyi Yan,Taichun Zhou,Xinwang Liu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMV-ND, a deep graph clustering method that processes large, attribute-missing graphs by generating complementary, non-redundant views from graph structures, resulting in improved clustering outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs, like social networks, are often large-scale and have missing attributes, which limits the effectiveness of clustering methods. The authors aim to address these challenges.

Method: The proposed method, CMV-ND, preprocesses graph structural information by first recursively exploring local structures to ensure completeness and then applying a neighborhood differential strategy to eliminate redundancy. Complementary views are constructed from these representations, which are then used by existing clustering methods.

Result: Experimental results on six well-known graph datasets show that CMV-ND significantly enhances the performance of existing clustering methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: CMV-ND efficiently addresses the challenges of large-scale and attribute-missing graphs by creating comprehensive, non-overlapping views of graph structures, leading to better clustering results.

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes
in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential
in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation.
However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions,
are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we
propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary
\underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew
\underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation
(\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into
multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure
completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood
search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely
expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to
eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce
a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between
the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary
views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the
target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to
the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate
that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

### [268] [H-NeiFi: Non-Invasive and Consensus-Efficient Multi-Agent Opinion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13370)
*Shijun Guo,Haoran Xu,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Xinyi Zhang,Yishan Song,Jiwei Chen*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper introduces H-NeiFi, a non-intrusive framework leveraging hierarchical modeling and multi-agent reinforcement learning to promote quicker and more efficient consensus formation in social media while preserving user autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for social media opinion guidance face challenges such as provoking psychological resistance and aggravating divisions at the macro level due to their intrusive nature.

Method: The paper developed a hierarchical model based on social roles, employed neighbor filtering for adaptive user communication control, and optimized information propagation paths using multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that H-NeiFi improves consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and achieves global convergence even without expert involvement.

Conclusion: H-NeiFi offers a non-intrusive and autonomous solution for social network governance by efficiently guiding opinion evolution without direct interference, representing a transformative paradigm.

Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it
also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus.
Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group
connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke
psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus.
Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local
consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these
issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework,
H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles,
considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts.
Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that
adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths
through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user
interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0%
to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This
approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user
interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

### [269] [Leveraging the Spatial Hierarchy: Coarse-to-fine Trajectory Generation via Cascaded Hybrid Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13366)
*Baoshen Guo,Zhiqing Hong,Junyi Li,Shenhao Wang,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Cardiff proposes a novel diffusion-based framework for synthesizing fine-grained and privacy-preserving urban mobility data, effectively addressing challenges in generating realistic human mobility trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle privacy concerns and high data collection costs that hinder the availability of fine-grained human mobility trajectories, which are essential for economic growth and smart-city applications.

Method: The proposed method uses a coarse-to-fine cascaded framework leveraging hierarchical urban mobility structure. It combines transformer-based latent denoising at the segment level and conditional denoising with noise augmentation at the GPS level.

Result: Experimental results on three large-scale datasets show that Cardiff achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in generating realistic and privacy-preserving mobility trajectories.

Conclusion: Cardiff provides a robust solution for generating fine-grained mobility data while balancing utility and privacy preservation, offering advancements both in methodology and practical applications for smart cities.

Abstract: Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and
plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to
privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human
mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large
scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing.
However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of
trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and
generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose
Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory
synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility
generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff
decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road
segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,
to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first
encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and
design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level
trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,
we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a
noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.
Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates
high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables
a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental
results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.

### [270] [Conformal Contraction for Robust Nonlinear Control with Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13613)
*Sihang Wei,Melkior Ornik,Hiroyasu Tsukamoto*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robust control framework for nonlinear dynamical systems with state and input-dependent uncertainty, using data-driven approaches to ensure probabilistic trajectory stability without knowing the uncertainty model explicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of controlling nonlinear systems under uncertainties without relying on structural assumptions about the uncertainty models.

Method: The framework combines contraction-based robust control with data-driven uncertainty predictions and uses conformal prediction for probabilistic guarantees on stability.

Result: The framework offers a finite-time probabilistic guarantee for trajectory tracking error and proposes a robust control invariant tube for safe motion planning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves robustness and reliability in uncertain dynamical systems, as validated through numerical simulations.

Abstract: We present a novel robust control framework for continuous-time, perturbed
nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty that depends nonlinearly on both
the state and control inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that impose
structural assumptions on the uncertainty, our framework enhances
contraction-based robust control with data-driven uncertainty prediction,
remaining agnostic to the models of the uncertainty and predictor. We
statistically quantify how reliably the contraction conditions are satisfied
under dynamics with uncertainty via conformal prediction, thereby obtaining a
distribution-free and finite-time probabilistic guarantee for exponential
boundedness of the trajectory tracking error. We further propose the
probabilistically robust control invariant (PRCI) tube for distributionally
robust motion planning, within which the perturbed system trajectories are
guaranteed to stay with a finite probability, without explicit knowledge of the
uncertainty model. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed robust control framework and the performance of the PRCI tube.

### [271] [Faster Multi-Source Reachability and Approximate Distances via Shortcuts, Hopsets and Matrix Multiplication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13470)
*Michael Elkin,Chhaya Trehan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper develops new algorithms for the $S \times V$ reachability problem in directed graphs, achieving improved time complexity for both centralized and parallel models, particularly in graphs with small separators or specific properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to improve upon existing algorithms for solving the $S \times V$ reachability problem, which is crucial in graph analysis and many applications, and to address the inefficiencies in both traditional and parallel approaches.

Method: The authors leverage shortcut constructions from previous works and rectangular matrix multiplication techniques to achieve better time complexity in centralized models. For parallel algorithms, they optimize work complexity for graphs with small separators or bounded treewidth, and generalize their methods to various graph families and approximate distance computations.

Result: The proposed centralized algorithm achieves running time improvements for certain parameter ranges ($\sigma$). The parallel algorithm similarly reduces work complexity in broader cases compared to existing results, and the authors extend their methods to graphs with treewidth and small separators, along with approximate distance computations.

Conclusion: The paper presents a significant improvement in the efficiency of $S \times V$ reachability computation, advancing existing bounds and extending methods to diverse graph families and approximate problems, with applications for both centralized and parallel settings.

Abstract: Given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge digraph $G = (V,E)$ and a subset $S \subseteq V$
of $|S| = n^{\sigma}$ (for some $0 \le \sigma \le 1$) designated sources, the
$S \times V$ reachability problem is to compute the sets $\mathcal V_s$ of
vertices reachable from $s$, for every $s \in S$. Naive centralized algorithms
run BFS/DFS from each source in $O(m \cdot n^{\sigma})$ time or compute $G$'s
transitive closure in $\hat O(n^{\omega})$ time, where $\omega \le
2.371552\ldots$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Thus, the best known
bound is $\hat O(n^{\min \{ 2 + \sigma, \omega\}})$. Leveraging shortcut
constructions by Kogan and Parter [SODA 2022, ICALP 2022], we develop a
centralized algorithm with running time $\hat O(n^{1 + \frac{2}{3}
\omega(\sigma)})$, where $\omega(\sigma)$ is the rectangular matrix
multiplication exponent. Using current estimates on $\omega(\sigma)$, our
exponent improves upon $\min \{2 + \sigma, \omega \}$ for $\tilde \sigma \leq
\sigma \leq 0.53$, where $1/3 < \tilde \sigma < 0.3336$ is a universal
constant.
  In a classical result, Cohen [Journal of Algorithms, 1996] devised parallel
algorithms for $S \times V$ reachability on graphs admitting balanced recursive
separators of size $n^{\rho}$ for $\rho < 1$, requiring polylogarithmic time
and work $n^{\max \{\omega \rho, 2\rho + \sigma \} + o(1)}$. We significantly
improve, extend, and generalize Cohen's result. First, our parallel algorithm
for graphs with small recursive separators has lower work complexity than
Cohen's in boraod paramater ranges. Second, we generalize our algorithm to
graphs of treewidth at most $n^{\rho}$ ($\rho < 1$) and provide a centralized
algorithm that outperforms existing bounds for $S \times V$ reachability on
such graphs. We also do this for some other graph familes with small
separators. Finally, we extend these results to $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate
distance computation.

### [272] [Weighted Matching in a Poly-Streaming Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14114)
*Ahammed Ullah,S. M. Ferdous,Alex Pothen*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper proposes the poly-streaming model for distributed data stream processing with $k$ processors. It presents a single-pass algorithm for approximating the Maximum Weight Matching (MWM) problem with high efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address real-world scenarios where large-scale data streams need to be processed concurrently by multiple processors while optimizing space, runtime, and communication.

Method: The authors develop a framework for multi-processor streaming, introducing a single-pass algorithm for (2+ε)-approximation of the Maximum Weight Matching problem under shared and hierarchical architectures.

Result: The algorithm achieves efficient space and runtime performance, supports $O(1)$ per-edge processing time, and shows scalability with $k$ processors. It dramatically reduces runtime (by ~100x) and memory usage (by ~100,000x) compared to offline algorithms.

Conclusion: The poly-streaming model is a powerful tool for parallel graph-based computations, particularly for large datasets, achieving significant improvements in speed, memory usage, and match quality in practical evaluations.

Abstract: We introduce the poly-streaming model, a generalization of streaming models
of computation in which $k$ processors process $k$ data streams containing a
total of $N$ items. The algorithm is allowed $O\left(f(k)\cdot M_1\right)$
space, where $M_1$ is either $o\left(N\right)$ or the space bound for a
sequential streaming algorithm. Processors may communicate as needed.
Algorithms are assessed by the number of passes, per-item processing time,
total runtime, space usage, communication cost, and solution quality.
  We design a single-pass algorithm in this model for approximating the maximum
weight matching (MWM) problem. Given $k$ edge streams and a parameter
$\varepsilon > 0$, the algorithm computes a
$\left(2+\epsilon\right)$-approximate MWM. We analyze its performance in a
shared-memory parallel setting: for any constant $\varepsilon > 0$, it runs in
time $\widetilde{O}\left(L_{\max}+n\right)$, where $n$ is the number of
vertices and $L_{\max}$ is the maximum stream length. It supports
$O\left(1\right)$ per-edge processing time using $\widetilde{O}\left(k\cdot
n\right)$ space. We further generalize the design to hierarchical
architectures, in which $k$ processors are partitioned into $r$ groups, each
with its own shared local memory. The total intergroup communication is
$\widetilde{O}\left(r \cdot n\right)$ bits, while all other performance
guarantees are preserved.
  We evaluate the algorithm on a shared-memory system using graphs with
trillions of edges. It achieves substantial speedups as $k$ increases and
produces matchings with weights significantly exceeding the theoretical
guarantee. On our largest test graph, it reduces runtime by nearly two orders
of magnitude and memory usage by five orders of magnitude compared to an
offline algorithm.

### [273] [Tight Bounds for Answering Adaptively Chosen Concentrated Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13700)
*Emma Rapoport,Edith Cohen,Uri Stemmer*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: This paper investigates challenges in adaptive data analysis when data samples are correlated and focuses on the framework of concentrated queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intractability of correlated data in non-adaptive settings and explore limitations in adaptive settings using the concentrated queries framework.

Method: The research establishes theoretical impossibility results under the concentrated queries framework and provides a simplified version of existing algorithms.

Result: The study confirms a gap in utility between correlated and independent data settings in adaptive data analysis for concentrated queries.

Conclusion: The inherent limitations in the concentrated queries framework, under current assumptions, restrict utility in adaptive settings compared to independent data scenarios.

Abstract: Most work on adaptive data analysis assumes that samples in the dataset are
independent. When correlations are allowed, even the non-adaptive setting can
become intractable, unless some structural constraints are imposed. To address
this, Bassily and Freund [2016] introduced the elegant framework of
concentrated queries, which requires the analyst to restrict itself to queries
that are concentrated around their expected value. While this assumption makes
the problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it
remains quite challenging. In fact, all known algorithms in this framework
support significantly fewer queries than in the independent case: At most
$O(n)$ queries for a sample of size $n$, compared to $O(n^2)$ in the
independent setting.
  In this work, we prove that this utility gap is inherent under the current
formulation of the concentrated queries framework, assuming some natural
conditions on the algorithm. Additionally, we present a simplified version of
the best-known algorithms that match our impossibility result.

*Yaomin Jiang,Levin Brinkmann,Anne-Marie Nussberger,Ivan Soraperra,Jean-François Bonnefon,Iyad Rahwan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper examines how humans select partners between humans and AI in a communication-based game, finding that bots eventually outcompete humans when their identity is disclosed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans adapt and select partners in mixed societies with humans and AI, especially under the competitive pressure from AI.

Method: The authors conducted communication-based partner selection games in hybrid mini-societies of humans and LLM-powered bots through three experiments with 975 participants.

Result: The study found that bots, being prosocial and linguistically distinct yet misattributed by humans, are not initially favored. However, revealing their identity helps them outcompete humans over time by enabling better learning about partner type behavior.

Conclusion: AI can significantly reshape social dynamics in mixed human-AI societies. Strategic disclosure of bot identity may improve cooperation and guide hybrid system designs.

Abstract: Partner selection is crucial for cooperation and hinges on communication. As
artificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs),
become more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans
for partnerships. Yet little is known about how humans select between human and
AI partners and adapt under AI-induced competition pressure. We constructed a
communication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid
mini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through
three experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than
humans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially
when their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour
to humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it
reduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually
outcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each
partner type. These findings show how AI can reshape social interaction in
mixed societies and inform the design of more effective and cooperative hybrid
systems.

### [275] [The Emotion-Memory Link: Do Memorability Annotations Matter for Intelligent Systems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14084)
*Maria Tsfasman,Ramin Ghorbani,Catholijn M. Jonker,Bernd Dudzik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study investigates the link between group emotions and group memorability during conversational interactions, finding no reliable connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if emotional annotations can predict event memorability in intelligent systems for applications like meeting support and memory augmentation.

Method: The research involved analyzing continuous, time-based annotations of emotions (Pleasure-Arousal) and memorability in dynamic group conversations, mimicking real-world scenarios.

Result: The study found no discernible relationship between emotional cues and memorability annotations, suggesting randomness.

Conclusion: The findings challenge assumptions in Affective Computing, indicating that emotional cues may not reliably predict memorability, and highlight the need for further investigation.

Abstract: Humans have a selective memory, remembering relevant episodes and forgetting
the less relevant information. Possessing awareness of event memorability for a
user could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially
for such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and
meeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since
emotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The
emotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally
been considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced
as highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This
relationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for
memorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on
third-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person
experience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,
we empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions
(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational
interactions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of
both emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,
approximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as
online meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship
between affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished
from what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of
this surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective
Computing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader
discourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for
future research efforts.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper highlights the prevalence of automatically generated web content by large language models (LLMs) and introduces a scalable pipeline for detecting such content at the website level, demonstrating high accuracy in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are producing increasingly dominant web content, but such content can be unreliable and unethical due to plagiarism and hallucinations. There is a need to reliably detect such content since it is often undisclosed and hard for humans to recognize.

Method: The proposed method involves a scalable pipeline that classifies entire websites based on an LLM text detector's outputs from multiple prose-like pages. The pipeline is trained and tested using two diverse datasets comprising 120 sites, achieving perfect accuracy on them.

Result: The pipeline demonstrates 100% accuracy across two datasets in detecting LLM-dominant sites. When applied to 10,000 search engine results and 10,000 Common Crawl sites, it found many LLM-dominant sites, highlighting their growing prevalence and high ranking in search results.

Conclusion: LLM-dominant content is becoming increasingly common and influential on the web, and the proposed detection method offers a reliable solution to classify and track such content at scale, prompting future considerations for the web's integrity and user impact.

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models
(LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs
plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and
unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers
struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for
LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient,
because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content
has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire
websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we
classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple
prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct
ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing
across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant
among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We
find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search
results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web
ecosystem.

*Aditya Singh,Aastha Mishra,Manan Tayal,Shishir Kolathaya,Pushpak Jagtap*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage framework that combines gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for scalable and safe control of autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the trade-off between performance and safety in autonomy: CBFs ensure safety but may be conservative, and dynamic programming for SC-OCPs is computationally intractable for high-dimensional systems.

Method: The proposed method employs a two-stage approach: first, relaxing safety constraints into penalties for scalable optimization using gradient-based MPC; second, refining the controller via a CBF-based quadratic program to ensure strict safety constraints.

Result: Controllers generated by the framework achieve both high performance and provable safety, demonstrated through two case studies dealing with high-dimensional autonomous systems.

Conclusion: This framework successfully co-optimizes safety and performance while addressing scalability, offering a practical solution for handling real-world autonomous systems.

Abstract: Ensuring both performance and safety is critical for autonomous systems
operating in real-world environments. While safety filters such as Control
Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce constraints by modifying nominal controllers
in real time, they can become overly conservative when the nominal policy lacks
safety awareness. Conversely, solving State-Constrained Optimal Control
Problems (SC-OCPs) via dynamic programming offers formal guarantees but is
intractable in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that combines gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC)
with CBF-based safety filtering for co-optimizing safety and performance. In
the first stage, we relax safety constraints as penalties in the cost function,
enabling fast optimization via gradient-based methods. This step improves
scalability and avoids feasibility issues associated with hard constraints. In
the second stage, we modify the resulting controller using a CBF-based
Quadratic Program (CBF-QP), which enforces hard safety constraints with minimal
deviation from the reference. Our approach yields controllers that are both
performant and provably safe. We validate the proposed framework on two case
studies, showcasing its ability to synthesize scalable, safe, and
high-performance controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack mechanisms for fixed-time convergence, which is essential for time-sensitive, safety-critical systems like autonomous navigation.

Method: The method imposes a structured differential constraint using repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial, enabling closed-form polynomial solutions for exact time-bound convergence.

Result: The method was evaluated on three robotic systems and successfully enforced convergence within the desired time, outperforming traditional HOCBF approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a robust framework for real-time control with provable finite-time safety guarantees, making it suitable for critical applications.

Abstract: We present a novel method for designing higher-order Control Barrier
Functions (CBFs) that guarantee convergence to a safe set within a
user-specified finite. Traditional Higher Order CBFs (HOCBFs) ensure asymptotic
safety but lack mechanisms for fixed-time convergence, which is critical in
time-sensitive and safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation.
In contrast, our approach imposes a structured differential constraint using
repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial, enabling closed-form
polynomial solutions with exact convergence at a prescribed time. We derive
conditions on the barrier function and its derivatives that ensure forward
invariance and fixed-time reachability, and we provide an explicit formulation
for second-order systems. Our method is evaluated on three robotic systems - a
point-mass model, a unicycle, and a bicycle model and benchmarked against
existing HOCBF approaches. Results demonstrate that our formulation reliably
enforces convergence within the desired time, even when traditional methods
fail. This work provides a tractable and robust framework for real-time control
with provable finite-time safety guarantees.

### [279] [SAQR-QC: A Logic for Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13635)
*Nengkun Yu,Jens Palsberg,Thomas Reps*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAQR-QC, a logic for scalable and approximate quantitative reasoning about quantum circuits, using local reasoning steps to manage complexity and precision loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum program verification techniques are computationally expensive and impractical, particularly for quantum circuits with many qubits.

Method: The paper presents SAQR-QC, a logic that allows scalable reasoning with controlled precision loss, using local reasoning involving a small number of qubits at each step.

Result: The SAQR-QC logic was successfully demonstrated through case studies, including the verification of GHZ circuits and analysis of quantum phase estimation.

Conclusion: SAQR-QC makes reasoning about quantum circuits scalable and practical by balancing precision and computational requirements, marking a step forward in quantum program verification.

Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless
of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research,
existing verification techniques are insufficient--even for quantum circuits, a
deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins
many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require
exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of)
assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with
many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called
SAQR-QC. The logic supports Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning
about Quantum Circuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i)
some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism
to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps
remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, all
reasoning steps are local--i.e., they each involve just a small number of
qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the
verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of
quantum phase estimation--a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.

### [280] [Quantum Boltzmann Machines using Parallel Annealing for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14116)
*Daniëlle Schuman,Mark V. Seebode,Tobias Rohe,Maximilian Balthasar Mansky,Michael Schroedl-Baumann,Jonas Stein,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien,Florian Krellner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents an improved parallel quantum annealing method for training Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) in supervised settings, achieving faster training with significant speed-up and results comparable to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training QBMs requires large amounts of QPU time, making their application costly in the current NISQ era. The authors aim to ameliorate this issue by proposing improvements to parallel quantum annealing techniques.

Method: The paper introduces an enhanced parallel quantum annealing approach to train QBMs in supervised learning tasks, particularly on medical image data from the MedMNIST dataset.

Result: Experimental results show that QBMs trained with the proposed method achieve performance comparable to CNNs, requiring fewer epochs and attaining a 70% speed-up in training time compared to conventional annealing-based approaches.

Conclusion: The improved parallel quantum annealing method by the authors significantly reduces training time and demonstrates that QBMs are viable in real-world applications like medical image analysis, making them more applicable in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently
follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research
community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage
currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to
train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea
of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating
parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper
presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to
train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the
latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the
MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world
applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our
approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of
similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller
numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique
leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM
executions.

Main category: math-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores deformed Wigner random matrices, crucial for understanding deep neural networks (DNNs) and novel pruning techniques, focusing on the case of growing rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to rigorously understand the mathematical foundation of novel pruning techniques in DNNs, where weight matrices combine random and highly correlated components.

Method: The paper employs asymptotic analysis to extend mathematical understanding of deformed Wigner matrices to scenarios where the rank of the correlated component grows.

Result: Results provide theoretical insights and mathematical tools to analyze growing-rank deformed Wigner random matrices, contributing to DNN pruning techniques.

Conclusion: The findings offer broader mathematical underpinning for studying DNN weight matrices and improving methods like pruning by addressing challenges associated with growing rank.

Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices
are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of
trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and
$S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in
rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix
Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in
practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the
case of growing rank.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of service placement in cloud-edge networks by proposing an optimization approach using Answer Set Programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for efficient service placement in distributed cloud-edge systems, especially for handling unsatisfiable instances and relaxed DevOps preferences.

Method: Answer Set Programming is leveraged with its optimization capabilities to formulate and solve the combinatorial service placement problem.

Result: Experimental results in simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on realistic networks and applications.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective solution to service placement using optimization techniques, accommodating relaxed preferences and unsatisfiable constraints.

Abstract: Novel utility computing paradigms rely upon the deployment of multi-service
applications to pervasive and highly distributed cloud-edge infrastructure
resources. Deciding onto which computational nodes to place services in
cloud-edge networks, as per their functional and non-functional constraints,
can be formulated as a combinatorial optimisation problem. Most existing
solutions in this space are not able to deal with \emph{unsatisfiable} problem
instances, nor preferences, i.e. requirements that DevOps may agree to relax to
obtain a solution. In this article, we exploit Answer Set Programming
optimisation capabilities to tackle this problem. Experimental results in
simulated settings show that our approach is effective on lifelike networks and
applications.

*Qingyun Sun,Jiaqi Yuan,Shan He,Xiao Guan,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Jianxin Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DyG-RAG framework improves temporal reasoning by introducing dynamic event-centered retrieval and generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) systems in temporal reasoning due to lack of proper modeling of evolving events and their sequence.

Method: DyG-RAG introduces Dynamic Event Units (DEUs) for precise semantic and temporal encoding. It builds event graphs to capture temporal/causal relationships, implements a time-aware event timeline retrieval system, and uses Time Chain-of-Thought for answer generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks show DyG-RAG significantly enhances accuracy and recall in temporal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: DyG-RAG sets a foundation for faithful and time-aware generation by offering an integrated pipeline addressing complex, temporally-sensitive queries.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces two architectures, RAG and GraphRAG, which integrate drug side effect knowledge into an LLM (Llama 3 8B), achieving near-perfect accuracy for drug side effect associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug side effects are a global health issue, and current LLMs lack reliability in pharmacovigilance due to limitations like hallucinations and the absence of domain-specific expertise.

Method: Two architectures, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, incorporate extensive drug side effect knowledge into the Llama 3 8B language model and undergo evaluation using 19,520 drug-side effect associations.

Result: GraphRAG demonstrated near-perfect accuracy in retrieving drug side effect associations, covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms.

Conclusion: The proposed architectures exemplify the potential for highly accurate and scalable pharmacovigilance solutions through domain-specific adaptations of LLMs.

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced
methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations,
including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to
hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability
in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose
two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which
integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language
model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations
(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that
GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This
framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a
significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance
applications.

### [285] [SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs: Measuring the Impact of Training Data Memorization and Knowledge Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13859)
*Aleksandr Gashkov,Aleksandr Perevalov,Maria Eltsova,Andreas Both*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to evaluate the SPARQL query generation capability of large language models (LLMs) for Question Answering systems via three experimental conditions: zero-shot, with knowledge injection, and anonymized knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to assess and enhance the quality, trustworthiness, and portability of natural-language-based Question Answering systems while addressing concerns over uncontrolled LLM training data that might already include benchmark or knowledge graph information.

Method: The authors introduce a method to evaluate LLM performance by generating SPARQL queries under three testing scenarios: zero-shot, with prior knowledge injection, and with anonymized knowledge injection. This is to determine the impact of training data memorization on QA performance.

Result: The results enable researchers to differentiate between model portability and performance reliance on prior exposure to benchmarks data during training, providing insights into LLM effectiveness for QA tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust, adaptable for various knowledge graphs, and offers a framework to critically analyze LLM capabilities, unveiling whether strong performance stems from memorization or genuine reasoning and understanding.

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces
cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,
generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named
Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the
central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the
rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method
to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is
still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and
trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have
no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already
included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that
evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a
natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL
generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge
injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of
the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will
help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly
be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.
LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any
knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,
s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is
possible.

*Alejandro Bellogín,Linus W. Dietz,Francesco Ricci,Pablo Sánchez*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper critically evaluates the challenges in point of interest (POI) recommendation systems and proposes a structured research agenda addressing issues like datasets, algorithms, and biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the real-world applicability of POI recommendation systems by addressing existing shortcomings and challenges in the domain.

Method: The authors analyzed the current state of POI recommendation research, identified critical issues across datasets, algorithms, and evaluations, and proposed a research agenda including areas like multistakeholder design and trustworthiness.

Result: They identified persistent issues, including lack of standardized datasets, flawed assumptions in models, and bias handling limitations. They also outlined future research directions for enhancement.

Conclusion: Current POI recommendation systems face fundamental challenges that require structured improvements in datasets, algorithms, and evaluation techniques. The proposed research agenda serves as a guide for addressing these gaps.

Abstract: Point of interest (POI) recommendation can play a pivotal role in enriching
tourists' experiences by suggesting context-dependent and preference-matching
locations and activities, such as restaurants, landmarks, itineraries, and
cultural attractions. Unlike some more common recommendation domains (e.g.,
music and video), POI recommendation is inherently high-stakes: users invest
significant time, money, and effort to search, choose, and consume these
suggested POIs. Despite the numerous research works in the area, several
fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of
the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the
POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The
first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state
of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings
across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation
methodologies. We highlight persistent issues such as the lack of standardized
benchmark datasets, flawed assumptions in the problem definition and model
design, and inadequate treatment of biases in the user behavior and system
performance. The second contribution is a structured research agenda that,
starting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future
work related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection,
trustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.

### [287] [DUALRec: A Hybrid Sequential and Language Model Framework for Context-Aware Movie Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13957)
*Yitong Li,Raoul Grasman*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DUALRec is a hybrid recommender system combining LSTM's temporal modeling with the semantic reasoning of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). It outperforms baseline models on the MovieLens-1M dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems struggle to model dynamic, context-rich user preferences. While LLMs offer semantic understanding, they lack temporal modeling capabilities, and LSTM models capture temporal dynamics but lack rich semantic reasoning.

Method: DUALRec integrates LSTM for temporal modeling and fine-tuned LLMs for semantic reasoning. The LSTM processes user viewing histories, and the LLM generates recommendations using temporal insights.

Result: Experimental validation on MovieLens-1M dataset demonstrates DUALRec's superior performance, evaluated with metrics like Hit Rate (HR@k), NDCG@k, and genre similarity.

Conclusion: DUALRec showcases the potential of combining temporal and semantic capabilities in recommender systems, pointing to promising advancements for intelligent, context-aware recommendation models.

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of
modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences.
Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to
capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their
strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently
designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On
the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which
is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user
preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for
comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec
(Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that
leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the
temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of
the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users
evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM
variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies
that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that
the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with
comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes
a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling
and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more
intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

*Osama Hardan,Omar Elshenhabi,Tamer Khattab,Mohamed Mabrok*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of patch scan order on segmentation performance in Mamba-based models for medical imaging, introducing a module to explore this factor without additional cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors seek to address the effect of patch scan order on performance in Mamba-based architectures, particularly in medical imaging where strong anatomical priors exist and this factor is intricately non-trivial.

Method: The researchers introduce the Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D) module, a parameter-free tool that facilitates exploration of various scan paths. They benchmarked 21 scan strategies across three public medical imaging datasets, analyzing over 70,000 slices.

Result: Scan order was found to be a statistically significant factor in model performance, with simple spatially contiguous paths outperforming disjointed scans, and performance variances reaching up to 27 Dice points.

Conclusion: Scan order is a critical, cost-free hyperparameter in medical imaging tasks for Mamba models. Recommendations for optimal paths are provided to aid future performance maximization.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear
computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D
sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan
order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong
anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first
systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce
Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures
that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational
cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public
datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our
analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant
factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance
varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple
horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal
scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and
provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the
performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study introduces BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation algorithm for breast MRI that identifies nine anatomical structures, achieving notable accuracy in segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing breast MRI segmentation methods are limited to a few anatomical structures, reducing their utility for quantitative analysis. This study aims to extend the range of segmentation to nine anatomical labels for better clinical and research applications.

Method: The authors developed BreastSegNet by manually annotating 1123 MRI slices with expert radiologist review. They benchmarked nine segmentation models, including nnU-Net ResEncM, for segmentation tasks.

Result: The nnU-Net ResEncM model achieved the best performance with an average Dice score of 0.694, excelling in several anatomical structures like heart (Dice score ~0.90).

Conclusion: BreastSegNet significantly expands the range of anatomical structures identified in breast MRI, advancing the field of quantitative breast imaging. The code is publicly available, with planned data release for further research.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer
screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.

TL;DR: This paper reviews a domain-randomization strategy to improve deep learning model generalization in neuroimaging using synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite deep learning's success in neuroimage analysis, its models struggle with robustness and generalization due to limited dataset diversity, particularly in MRI imaging.

Method: The strategy trains deep neural networks on synthetic images generated with randomized intensities and anatomical variations derived from segmentation maps.

Result: The approach effectively enables deep learning models to handle unseen image types across various imaging modalities, not limited to neuroimaging.

Conclusion: The synthesis-driven paradigm improves generalization and reduces overfitting but introduces computational trade-offs, providing an accessible solution for researchers with limited machine learning experience or resources.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key
benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while
discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the
article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to
accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more
accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning method to synthesize ultra-high-resolution 7T brain MRIs from 3T MRIs, achieving almost real 7T image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make ultra-high-resolution 7T MRI more accessible by synthesizing 7T images from widely available 3T MRIs, addressing cost and accessibility barriers.

Method: Two advanced deep learning models, U-Net and GAN U-Net, were trained on paired 7T and 3T images from 172 participants. The models' performance was compared to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Result: The models produced synthetic 7T images comparable to real 7T images in quality, as judged by MRI professionals. Additionally, synthetic images offered better artifact reduction and segmentation accuracy while maintaining performance in cognitive prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Synthetic 7T brain images can be effectively generated from 3T MRIs, enhancing image quality, segmentation accuracy, and potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution
and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We
present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T
brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172
participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish
BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:
a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial
network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art
3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Dynamic Image Prior (D2IP), a framework for fast and accurate 3D time-sequence tomographic imaging, improving upon the computational inefficiency of Deep Image Prior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational cost and inefficiency of unsupervised methods like Deep Image Prior in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic imaging.

Method: The paper proposes D2IP, which utilizes three strategies: Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a lightweight reconstruction backbone, 3D-FastResUNet.

Result: Experiments on simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets show that D2IP improves image quality by 24.8% (average MSSIM), reduces error by 8.1%, and is 7.1x faster compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: D2IP significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of 3D time-sequence imaging, making it promising for clinical applications such as dynamic pulmonary imaging.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),
highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.

### [297] [Blind Super Resolution with Reference Images and Implicit Degradation Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13915)
*Huu-Phu Do,Po-Chih Hu,Hao-Chien Hsueh,Che-Kai Liu,Vu-Hoang Tran,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method for blind super-resolution (BSR) by introducing scale-aware degradation kernels and HR reference images to adaptively discern the degradation process for better SR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous BSR techniques, which assumed uniform degradation kernels across different scales, making them impractical for varied super-resolution tasks.

Method: The method uses high-resolution (HR) reference images, unrelated to the target, alongside the low-resolution (LR) input, to create scale-aware degradation kernels. These references help generate LR-HR pairs, enhancing training and SR performance.

Result: The proposed approach consistently outperforms prior methods in both trained and zero-shot blind SR models, showcasing improved results across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Dual consideration of both blur kernels and scaling factors, supported by the introduction of reference images, effectively improves the BSR performance and addresses the limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.

*Jiaqi Lv,Yijie Zhu,Carmen Guadalupe Colin Tenorio,Brinder Singh Chohan,Mark Eastwood,Shan E Ahmed Raza*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a deep learning model using pathology foundation model Virchow2 for accurate segmentation of tissue types in melanoma H&E images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Melanoma diagnosis and prognosis require precise tissue morphology characterization, but manual segmentation of tissue regions is time-consuming and inconsistent.

Method: A deep learning approach combines features from pathology foundation model Virchow2 with an Efficient-UNet encoder-decoder network for tissue segmentation.

Result: The proposed model achieved first place in the PUMA Grand Challenge, showcasing high performance and generalizability in segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating foundation models like Virchow2 with segmentation networks can improve accuracy and efficiency in computational pathology workflows.

Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.

*Shravan Venkatraman,Pavan Kumar S,Rakesh Raj Madavan,Chandrakala S*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UGPL is an uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework designed to improve CT image classification by focusing on regions of diagnostic ambiguity and conducting detailed analysis. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT image classification for diagnosis and treatment planning faces limitations in detecting localized, subtle pathological features due to existing uniform processing methods.

Method: UGPL utilizes evidential deep learning to assess predictive uncertainty, identifies regions of diagnostic ambiguity, and extracts informative patches via non-maximum suppression. It employs an adaptive fusion mechanism for global-to-local analysis.

Result: UGPL outperformed state-of-the-art methods with accuracy improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% for kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-guided progressive learning pipeline in UGPL significantly enhances the precision of CT image classification by combining contextual and fine-grained information.

Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive
learning pipeline is implemented. Our code is available at:

*Vijay K. Dubey,Collin E. Haese,Osman Gültekin,David Dalton,Manuel K. Rausch,Jan N. Fuhg*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a graph neural network for modeling contact in deformable bodies, achieving a 1000x speedup during inference for tested scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surrogate models for contact mechanics lack effectiveness in cases involving soft, deformable bodies, especially with varying geometries.

Method: The study proposes a graph neural network architecture with continuous collision detection and sufficient conditions for soft body contacts, and examines its performance on benchmark scenarios, including a bioprosthetic aortic valve application.

Result: The neural network demonstrated improved generalization by adding contact terms to the loss function. It handled varying geometries effectively but came with high computational training costs, leading to a significant trade-off.

Conclusion: While the proposed method offers excellent inference speedups and flexibility, its high training cost may limit its broader applicability.

Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems
in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However,
effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of
deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an
open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact
or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact
planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that
serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions
for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture
that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time,
incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable
bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft
tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic
valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the
loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits
hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and
complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also
demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries.
However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training,
resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the
training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware
architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in
up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function, introduces a partition function and free energy functional, and analyzes information-theoretic and statistical mechanics constructs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to establish a mathematical connection between information theory and statistical mechanics to better understand model complexity, generalization, and overfitting through duality and phase transitions.

Method: The authors utilize Legendre-Fenchel duality, define a partition function and free energy functional, and analyze detailed balance and acceptance probabilities. They conduct experiments with regression models to validate theoretical predictions.

Result: The findings confirm a peak in susceptibility-like variance at loss-complexity trade-offs, identifying phase transitions and validating theoretical models with experimental results.

Conclusion: The study bridges information theory and statistical mechanics, providing insights into trade-offs in modeling and generalization while addressing overfitting thresholds effectively.

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function
$h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We
establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and
statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free
energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the
structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis
kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic
scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is
shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase
transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models
verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay
between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

*Jing Chang,Chang Liu,Jinbin Huang,Rui Mao,Jianbin Qin*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces CogniQ-H, a soft hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, for automated data preparation that shows significant improvement in pipeline quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning methods for data preparation are inefficient due to their inability to leverage the structured and hierarchical nature of the task.

Method: CogniQ-H employs a soft hierarchical reinforcement learning approach, combining strategic priors from large language models, operator scores from supervised Learning-to-Rank models, and value estimates from the agent's Q-function for balanced decision-making.

Result: CogniQ-H improves pipeline quality by up to 13.9% and achieves 2.8x faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods based on experiments with 18 diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, specifically their soft hierarchical approach in CogniQ-H, is a robust and efficient framework for automated data preparation, offering superior quality and speed compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of
the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search
space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers
a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to
capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful
in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored
framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard
hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we
introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical
paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates
action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior,
generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration
probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained
operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a
long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid
architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive,
evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse
datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to
13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence
compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.

TL;DR: LLaPipe introduces a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the efficiency of preprocessing pipeline exploration in machine learning. It achieves better quality and faster convergence than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based approaches for automated data preparation are inefficient in exploring complex preprocessing pipelines.

Method: LLaPipe incorporates an LLM Policy Advisor for semantic guidance, an Experience Distillation mechanism for knowledge transfer, and an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy for optimizing LLM usage.

Result: LLaPipe improves pipeline quality by up to 22.4%, speeds up convergence by 2.3 times, and uses LLMs in only 19% of the exploration steps, ensuring computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs as intelligent advisors in automated machine learning data preparation, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet
existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient
exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present
LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike
traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind
trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes
dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing
operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful
patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future
exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy
(Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention
is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational
cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple
domains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\% improvement in
pipeline quality and 2.3$\times$ faster convergence compared to
state-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency
through selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\% of total exploration steps).
