Evaluating the system-wide\nbenefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications\nacross multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based\nplatforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM\nchips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1)\nthey require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting\naccessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern\ncomputing systems.\n  We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate\nend-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes\nthe main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First,\nEasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by\nenabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language\n(C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design\nin a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental\nchallenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically\noperate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to\nreplicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling\nthe processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel\ntechnique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior\nof the modeled system.\n  We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory\nsystem design to rapidly come to fruition.

This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,\nblack-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can\nbe highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require\nsignificant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey\nmodification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively\non closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields\nimprovements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on\na range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks.

Yet, despite recent advances,\ntheir output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains\ndifficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),\nresearchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.\nNevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,\nsuch as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.\nIn this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that\nharnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving\naccuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of\ndecompiled code: \\textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.\nCentral to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system\nto score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,\nD-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher\nscores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,\nD-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler\nand symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then\nevaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with\nthe original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for\nfine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,\ndemonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the\ncoreutils and util-linux projects.

This\npaper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)\nframework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis\nof non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a\nwavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and\nintegration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling\nfine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction\nmechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to\ntrimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and\nnon-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by\n1.13% on accuracy.
