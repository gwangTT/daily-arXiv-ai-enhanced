### [1] [AI Survival Stories: a Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09765)
*Herman Cappelen,Simon Goldstein,John Hawthorne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a framework for assessing existential risks posed by AI systems and creates a taxonomy of scenarios in which humanity survives despite AI's threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ongoing debates about the existential risk posed by AI systems and to develop tools for thinking systematically about this issue.

Method: The paper formulates a two-premise argument: AI systems becoming powerful and them leading to humanity's destruction. A taxonomy of survival scenarios is built based on whether one premise fails.

Result: The taxonomy suggests four survival scenarios where humanity either avoids powerful AI systems or coexists with them without destruction. It identifies challenges and responses associated with each.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes varying challenges for survival scenarios and offers rough estimates of P(doom), aiding in understanding AI-related existential risks and motivating tailored responses.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a lot of debate about whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity. This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.

### [2] [GUI-Eyes: Tool-Augmented Perception for Visual Grounding in GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09770)
*Chen Chen,Jiawei Shao,Dakuan Lu,Haoyi Hu,Xiangcheng Liu,Hantao Yao,Wu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Eyes introduces a reinforcement learning framework to improve active perception in GUI tasks, using a two-level policy for tool-based strategic observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance GUI automation by addressing the limitations of passive perception and static visual inputs in existing vision-language and reinforcement learning models.

Method: Implement a two-stage reasoning process with progressive perception strategy and spatially continuous reward functions to achieve adaptive and tool-aware active observation.

Result: GUI-Eyes-3B achieved 44.8% grounding accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark using only 3k labeled samples, surpassing existing baselines.

Conclusion: Tool-aware active perception, enabled by advanced policy reasoning and reward structures, is essential for efficient and robust GUI automation systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven progress in GUI automation. However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

### [3] [PCN-Rec: Agentic Proof-Carrying Negotiation for Reliable Governance-Constrained Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09771)
*Aradhya Dixit,Shreem Dixit*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PCN-Rec introduces a structured pipeline enhancing LLM recommenders to enforce governance constraints effectively while maintaining recommendation utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based recommendations can produce compelling results but fail to consistently meet governance constraints such as diversity and long-tail exposure.

Method: The method involves a negotiation pipeline comprising a base recommender, a mediator LLM, two agents (User Advocate and Policy Agent), and a deterministic verifier to ensure constraint compliance and auditability.

Result: On MovieLens-100K dataset, PCN-Rec achieved 98.55% compliance with governance constraints while causing minimal impact on recommendation accuracy (small NDCG@10 drop).

Conclusion: PCN-Rec successfully balances constraint enforcement and recommendation utility, providing auditable and reliable results for governance adherence.

Abstract: Modern LLM-based recommenders can generate compelling ranked lists, but they struggle to reliably satisfy governance constraints such as minimum long-tail exposure or diversity requirements. We present PCN-Rec, a proof-carrying negotiation pipeline that separates natural-language reasoning from deterministic enforcement. A base recommender (MF/CF) produces a candidate window of size W, which is negotiated by two agents: a User Advocate optimizing relevance and a Policy Agent enforcing constraints. A mediator LLM synthesizes a top-N slate together with a structured certificate (JSON) describing the claimed constraint satisfaction. A deterministic verifier recomputes all constraints from the slate and accepts only verifier-checked certificates; if verification fails, a deterministic constrained-greedy repair produces a compliant slate for re-verification, yielding an auditable trace. On MovieLens-100K with governance constraints, PCN-Rec achieves a 98.55% pass rate on feasible users (n = 551, W = 80) versus a one-shot single-LLM baseline without verification/repair, while preserving utility with only a 0.021 absolute drop in NDCG@10 (0.403 vs. 0.424); differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

### [4] [Antisocial behavior towards large language model users: experimental evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09772)
*Paweł Niszczota,Cassandra Grützner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates if social disapproval of large language model users leads to monetary punishment, finding that participants penalized peers heavily for relying on these models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavioral and social implications of using large language models (LLMs), specifically whether negative sentiments towards LLM users result in costly actions.

Method: A two-phase online experiment with 491 participants, involving monetary sanctions against peers dependent on LLMs during a real-effort task.

Result: Participants destroyed 36% of earnings of exclusive LLM users, with punishment increasing proportionally to LLM usage and a credibility gap penalizing suspicious disclosures.

Conclusion: Reliance on LLMs enhances efficiency but also incurs substantial social sanctions, indicating tension between technological adoption and social acceptance.

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

### [5] [Improving Chain-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning via Attention-Aware Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09805)
*Nguyen Minh Phuong,Dang Huu Tien,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a non-interactive, end-to-end framework that steers large language models (LLMs) to perform logical reasoning using a novel approach called Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing logical reasoning methods for LLMs often require either interactive, resource-heavy frameworks or external tools, impacting scalability or efficiency. There is a need for an approach that facilitates reasoning end-to-end within the model itself, thus balancing generalization, scalability, and analyzability.

Method: The paper introduces a method where structural information in few-shot prompts activates specific attention heads linked with logical operators. It then proposes the Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), which modulates attention scores at inference time to enhance reasoning processes, linking them to prior knowledge.

Result: AAI improves logical reasoning performance across various benchmarks and model architectures with minimal computational cost. It demonstrates efficiency in its intervention while preserving reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The non-interactive and end-to-end framework using AAI provides an effective and scalable solution for enhancing logical reasoning in LLMs. This method addresses the constraints of prior approaches and facilitates leveraging reasoning capabilities without external resources.

Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

### [6] [Thinking Long, but Short: Stable Sequential Test-Time Scaling for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09855)
*Michael R. Metel,Yufei Cui,Boxing Chen,Prasanna Parthasarathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Min-Seek is a novel test-time scaling method that overcomes issues in reasoning model accuracy degradation and instability, offering significant improvement in accuracy and efficiency while extending beyond a model's context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current test-time scaling methods, such as accuracy degradation and instability during extended reasoning, and to eliminate the need for fine-tuning reasoning length.

Method: The proposed method, Min-Seek, stabilizes accuracy by keeping only the key-value pairs of one additional induced thought in the KV cache. A custom KV cache dynamically encodes keys without positional embeddings to enable effective reasoning beyond maximum context lengths.

Result: Min-Seek achieves significant accuracy improvements across varied reasoning tasks, stabilizes sequential test-time scaling, and enables efficient reasoning even for extended contexts with linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: Min-Seek remedies major limitations in test-time scaling, offering a robust and efficient method to enhance reasoning model accuracy and applicability across extended contexts.

Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.

### [7] [A Scoping Review of the Ethical Perspectives on Anthropomorphising Large Language Model-Based Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09869)
*Andrea Ferrario,Rasita Vinay,Matteo Casserini,Alessandro Facchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews how anthropomorphisation in large language model-based conversational agents (LLM-based CAs) affects interaction and ethics, offering a research agenda and governance recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are motivated to understand the ethical implications of anthropomorphisation in LLM-based conversational agents, given its increasing prevalence and its potential to enhance engagement while raising ethical concerns.

Method: The study conducts a scoping review across five databases and three preprint repositories to map ethically oriented literature on anthropomorphising LLM-based conversational agents.

Result: The review identifies a convergence on attribution-based definitions but finds divergence in operationalization, predominantly risk-focused normative perspectives, and limited empirical research to guide actionable governance strategies.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for a robust research agenda and provides governance recommendations for ethical deployment of anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

Abstract: Anthropomorphisation -- the phenomenon whereby non-human entities are ascribed human-like qualities -- has become increasingly salient with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

### [8] [Epistemology gives a Future to Complementarity in Human-AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09871)
*Andrea Ferrario,Alessandro Facchini,Juan M. Durán*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores human-AI complementarity, reframing it as evidence of reliable predictive processes using epistemology, to improve decision-making calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address theoretical challenges of human-AI complementarity, aiming to better define, measure, and utilize this concept in decision-making processes.

Method: They leverage epistemology, specifically computational reliabilism, to redefine complementarity as evidence of reliability in predictive human-AI interactions.

Result: Complementarity becomes a guideline for assessing the reliability of human-AI processes, contributing to practical reasoning for stakeholders like patients and regulators.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that complementarity’s value lies in calibrating decision-making to reliable AI-supported processes rather than solely measuring prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.

### [9] [Beyond Rule-Based Workflows: An Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agents Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent Communication from CORAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09883)
*Xinxing Ren,Quagmire Zang,Caelum Forder,Suman Deb,Ahsen Tahir,Roman J. Georgio,Peter Carroll,Zekun Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new multi-agent system paradigm that overcomes limitations of rule-based workflows in large language model-based systems, achieving better accuracy and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems rely on predefined workflows that are labor-intensive and unsuitable for handling complex real-world task states exhaustively.

Method: The researchers propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated MAS via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication framework, using an orchestrator for real-time coordination of agents without predefined workflows.

Result: The proposed paradigm demonstrated a significant accuracy improvement, achieving 63.64% compared to the baseline's 55.15%, alongside better token efficiency and edge case adaptability.

Conclusion: The approach improves task monitoring flexibility and edge case handling in MAS, and its implementation is made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) rely on predefined workflows, where human engineers enumerate task states in advance and specify routing rules and contextual injections accordingly. Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/Coral-Protocol/Beyond-Rule-Based-Workflows

### [10] [Continuum Memory Architectures for Long-Horizon LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09913)
*Joe Logan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA), addressing limitations in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by enabling memory updating and persistence across interactions for long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the shortcomings of RAG systems, which treat memory as stateless and lack temporal continuity or the ability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory.

Method: The authors propose the Continuum Memory Architecture (CMA), which maintains and updates internal memory states through features like persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and abstraction consolidation.

Result: CMA demonstrates consistent performance advantages over RAG in tasks involving knowledge updates, temporal associations, memory recall, and contextual disambiguation.

Conclusion: CMA is a vital architectural element for creating long-horizon agents, though challenges like latency, memory drift, and interpretability remain unsolved.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.

### [11] [CaMeLs Can Use Computers Too: System-level Security for Computer Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09923)
*Hanna Foerster,Robert Mullins,Tom Blanchard,Nicolas Papernot,Kristina Nikolić,Florian Tramèr,Ilia Shumailov,Cheng Zhang,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the vulnerability of AI Computer Use Agents (CUAs) to prompt injection attacks and proposes a secure architecture based on single-shot planning to prevent such attacks while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents, especially CUAs, are prone to prompt injection attacks, creating risks such as credential theft or financial loss. Ensuring the security of these agents is critical to their reliable use.

Method: The authors propose a single-shot planning method for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete workflow graph before interacting with potentially malicious environments. This architectural design ensures control flow integrity.

Result: The approach effectively prevents instruction injections and improves security while maintaining up to 57% of the performance of frontier models and enhancing smaller open-source models' performance by 19%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that robust security measures can coexist with functional utility in CUAs, though further protections are required against Branch Steering attacks.

Abstract: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.

### [12] [Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09929)
*Ahmad Pesaranghader,Erin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework to address hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by categorizing causes and introducing targeted detection and mitigation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and LRMs exhibit transformative potential in regulated and high-stakes fields, but their hallucination tendencies pose a significant challenge to their reliability and safe deployment.

Method: The paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework to manage hallucinations through root cause analysis, detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation), and stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding).

Result: The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated via a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, showcasing a feedback loop across model, data, and context tiers for reliability improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a systematic and scalable solution for deploying trustworthy LLMs and LRMs in high-stakes, regulated environments, emphasizing continuous improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) offer transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate, generating factually incorrect or unsupported content, poses a critical reliability risk. This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes. The framework integrates multi-faceted detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). We demonstrate its application through a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, where model, context, and data tiers form a closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement. This approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LabourLawLLM, a specialized large language model for Chinese labor law, outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs in legal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of general-purpose language models like GPT-4, which struggle with subdomains requiring precise legal knowledge, by developing a specialized legal language model for Chinese labor law.

Method: The methodology includes creating LabourLawLLM, a tailored legal LLM, and LabourLawBench, a benchmark for evaluating labor law tasks, using both objective metrics and subjective assessments through GPT-4 scoring.

Result: LabourLawLLM outperformed general-purpose language models and existing legal-specific models across various legal tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialization.

Conclusion: The development of LabourLawLLM showcases the viability and benefits of tailoring specialized LLMs for specific legal subdomains, with potential applicability to other areas of law.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in domain-specific applications, particularly within the legal domain. However, general-purpose models such as GPT-4 often struggle with specialized subdomains that require precise legal knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity. To address these limitations, we present LabourLawLLM, a legal large language model tailored to Chinese labor law. We also introduce LabourLawBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse labor-law tasks, including legal provision citation, knowledge-based question answering, case classification, compensation computation, named entity recognition, and legal case analysis. Our evaluation framework combines objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, and soft-F1) with subjective assessment based on GPT-4 scoring. Experiments show that LabourLawLLM consistently outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories. Beyond labor law, our methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications.

### [14] [SPRInG: Continual LLM Personalization via Selective Parametric Adaptation and Retrieval-Interpolated Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09974)
*Seoyeon Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRInG is a novel framework for adapting large language models to evolving user preferences without catastrophic forgetting, outperforming current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalization methods for large language models assume static user preferences, but real-world preferences evolve over time, creating challenges in addressing preference drift without forgetting past knowledge.

Method: SPRInG uses a semi-parametric approach with drift-driven selective adaptation, employing a likelihood-based scoring function for detecting preference changes and a replay buffer for retaining crucial information, along with relevance gating and logit interpolation for inference.

Result: SPRInG achieves superior performance compared to baselines in long-form personalized generation tasks, showcasing its capacity to handle real-world dynamic personalization scenarios.

Conclusion: The SPRInG framework provides an effective solution for continual personalization of large language models, demonstrating robustness to evolving user preferences and setting new standards in personalized language generation.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation.

*Zerui Yang,Weichuan Wang,Yanwei Xu,Linqi Song,Yudai Matsuda,Wei Han,Bo Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Memo-SQL, a training-free NL2SQL framework solving key challenges in accuracy, efficiency, and decomposition through structured methods and self-correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2SQL systems struggle with limited error-guidance input and inefficiencies in test-time scaling approaches, which compromise accuracy or demand excessive computational resources.

Method: Memo-SQL introduces structured decomposition strategies (entity-wise, hierarchical, atomic sequential) and dynamic memory-based correction utilizing historical error-fix pairs for retrieval-based inference without requiring training or external APIs.

Result: Memo-SQL achieves a state-of-the-art 68.5% execution accuracy on BIRD dataset, surpassing open and zero-tuning models with significantly lower computational resource requirements.

Conclusion: Memo-SQL demonstrates that structured decomposition and memory-driven error correction can enhance both robustness and efficiency in NL2SQL systems, opening pathways for scalable, fine-tuning-free solutions.

Abstract: Existing NL2SQL systems face two critical limitations: (1) they rely on in-context learning with only correct examples, overlooking the rich signal in historical error-fix pairs that could guide more robust self-correction; and (2) test-time scaling approaches often decompose questions arbitrarily, producing near-identical SQL candidates across runs and diminishing ensemble gains. Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required. On BIRD, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods, while using over 10 times fewer resources than prior TTS approaches.

*Jinpeng Wang,Xinyu Jia,Wei Wei Heng,Yuquan Li,Binbin Shi,Qianlei Chen,Guannan Chen,Junxia Zhang,Yuyu Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores modeling Large Language Models (LLMs) with human-like personalities using psychological frameworks to enhance human-computer interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop LLMs capable of exhibiting human-like and adaptive personality traits which improve engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism in interactions.

Method: Introduced a framework based on Jungian psychological types, using mechanisms for coherence, adaptability, and evolution: dominant-auxiliary coordination, reinforcement-compensation, and reflection.

Result: Developed evolving, personality-aware LLMs that demonstrated coherent and context-sensitive interactions. The framework was evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and test scenarios.

Conclusion: The results suggest that personality-aware LLMs offer naturalistic and adaptable interaction capabilities, advancing human-computer interaction design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping human-computer interaction (HCI), from personalized assistants to social simulations. Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.

*Tingyue Pan,Jie Ouyang,Mingyue Cheng,Qingchuan Li,Zirui Liu,Mingfan Pan,Shuo Yu,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PaperScout, an innovative autonomous agent for academic paper search that adapts dynamically to queries rather than following rigid workflows. It employs a novel Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO) method for enhanced learning and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing academic paper search methods rely on fixed workflows, which are ineffective for handling complex, conditional queries. There is a need for a system that can dynamically adapt to diverse search scenarios with high relevance and recall.

Method: The authors propose PaperScout, a sequential decision-making autonomous agent, and develop the Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO) method for policy optimization at the sequence level. This approach addresses challenges in multi-turn reinforcement learning contexts for better performance.

Result: Experimental results show that PaperScout outperforms traditional workflow-driven systems and reinforcement learning baselines on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, achieving better recall and relevance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a dynamic, agent-based approach to academic paper search, combined with the novel PSPO optimization method, can significantly improve search performance, positioning PaperScout as a strong alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Academic paper search is a fundamental task in scientific research, yet most existing approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex, conditional queries. To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces FilDeep, a novel Deep Learning framework, designed to address the challenges of large deformation computation in elastic-plastic solids by leveraging both low-and high-fidelity datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional numerical methods and current deep learning models in dealing with large deformation problems, especially the dataset quantity-accuracy tradeoff.

Method: The method proposes a Deep Learning framework called FilDeep, which uses multi-fidelity data (low-fidelity and high-fidelity) and attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to optimize large deformation computations.

Result: FilDeep demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in solving the stretch bending problem, effectively balancing dataset quantity and accuracy, and has practical applications in manufacturing.

Conclusion: FilDeep successfully bridges the gap in large deformation problems by integrating multi-fidelity data and advanced DL techniques, promoting efficiency and accuracy in complex manufacturing processes.

Abstract: The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines real-world usage of large language models (LLMs), utilizing over 100 trillion tokens of data from OpenRouter, revealing trends such as roleplay, coding assistance, and user retention effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in empirical understanding of how large language models (LLMs) are utilized in real-world scenarios, especially following the release of multi-step reasoning models like o1.

Method: The study analyzed over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions gathered from the OpenRouter platform, encompassing tasks, geographies, and user behaviors.

Result: The study found significant adoption of open-weight models, a surprising interest in creative roleplay, prominent usage in coding assistance, rising agentic inference, and a lasting engagement of early user cohorts, termed the ‘Glass Slipper’ effect.

Conclusion: A data-driven understanding of LLM usage reveals diverse applications and engagement patterns, providing valuable insights for better designing and deploying AI systems.

Abstract: The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella "Glass Slipper" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs "in the wild" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.

*Ke Chen,Jiandian Zeng,Zihao Peng,Guo Li,Guangxue Zhang,Tian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces MatrixCoT, a structured Chain-of-Thought framework enhancing logical reasoning in language models with a matrix-based method for stability and verifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current LLM reasoning approaches, especially on logical tasks reliant on symbolic expressions and deductive rules. Existing methods face brittleness with external solvers or lack structured error correction.

Method: MatrixCoT normalizes and types natural language expressions, attaches explicit citation fields, and introduces a matrix-based planning mechanism to preserve the global relationship among reasoning steps. It also incorporates feedback-driven replanning for fixing errors and generating trustworthy outputs.

Result: MatrixCoT demonstrates enhanced robustness and interpretability in complex reasoning benchmarks, improving performance on various tasks without relying on external solvers.

Conclusion: The proposed MatrixCoT framework improves logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by combining structure, stability, feedback mechanisms, and matrix planning, offering a promising alternative in neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.

*Cheng Feng,Chaoliang Zhong,Jun Sun,Yusuke Oishi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of deploying large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks and proposes methods to enable smaller student models to potentially surpass their teacher models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying massive LLMs for domain-specific tasks is computationally intensive. There is a need for smaller student models to efficiently match or outperform their teachers, despite the inherent capacity gap.

Method: The study introduces two techniques: Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which mimics the teacher's convergence during fine-tuning, and Adaptive Weighting (AW), which emphasizes student strengths in specific subdomains.

Result: The proposed methods consistently outperform existing distillation techniques across tasks like QA, NER, and text classification in various languages. The student models often match or exceed their teachers.

Conclusion: Smaller student models can outperform larger teacher models on domain-specific tasks using innovative methods like SCD and AW, addressing the efficiency and capacity challenges of LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MolGen, a two-stage molecule generation framework fulfilling complex multi-property numeric constraints. It outperforms current approaches in precision and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of generating molecules that satisfy precise multi-objective numerical constraints on physicochemical properties, a limitation of existing large language models.

Method: The proposed MolGen framework operates in two stages: Stage I involves prototype molecule generation through fragment-level edits using a multi-agent reasoner. Stage II employs RL-based optimization, leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine molecules toward satisfying property constraints while maintaining structural similarity to prototypes.

Result: MolGen demonstrates superior performance in molecule generation and multi-property satisfaction, achieving higher validity and precision versus state-of-the-art LLMs and graph-based algorithms, as validated in experiments with targeted property constraints.

Conclusion: By leveraging fragment-level reasoning and RL-based optimization, MolGen enhances molecule generation processes, achieving better control and precision over multi-property constraints. This methodology offers a robust solution to a significant challenge in computational chemistry.

Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform medical imaging by automating image analysis and accelerating clinical research. However, research and clinical use are limited by the wide variety of AI implementations and architectures, inconsistent documentation, and reproducibility issues. Here, we introduce MHub.ai, an open-source, container-based platform that standardizes access to AI models with minimal configuration, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in medical imaging. MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis. By simplifying model use, MHub.ai enables side-by-side benchmarking with identical execution commands and standardized outputs, and lowers the barrier to clinical translation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict time intervals between user actions in structured data, finding that they underperform compared to machine learning models and are sensitive to the level of added contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the capacity of LLMs in understanding and predicting temporal patterns in behavioral data, a largely underexplored area.

Method: The study benchmarks state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings using a repurchase prediction scenario, comparing them with statistical and machine-learning models while varying the amount of contextual information provided.

Result: LLMs outperform statistical baselines but underperform machine-learning models, with their accuracy improving slightly with moderate context, but declining with excessive user-level contextual information.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit limitations in structured temporal inference; adding excessive context may degrade their accuracy. The study calls for hybrid models combining statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static historical data in dynamic financial markets, where concept drift and non-stationarity lead to poor model generalization and performance.

Method: The paper proposes a drift-aware dataflow system that incorporates an adaptive control mechanism for curating data. This includes a parameterized data manipulation module (utilizing transformations, mix-ups, and curation) combined with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization.

Result: Experiments showed improved model robustness and better risk-adjusted returns in forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks, validating the system's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust, generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation, addressing distributional challenges in financial data.

Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors explore whether LLMs, using their Transformer foundation and large-scale learning, can enhance long-horizon decision-making tasks like computational advertising and bidding.

Method: They treat trajectories as a unique modality and align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions for autoregressive prediction. DecisionLLM is evaluated on offline benchmarks.

Result: DecisionLLM-3B surpasses traditional Decision Transformers, with improvements of 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and 0.085 on AuctionNet, showing its effectiveness in offline decision-making tasks.

Conclusion: The work extends the applicability of transformer-based models like LLMs to decision-making tasks and offers a promising approach for future online optimization problems in bidding.

Abstract: Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMPG, a novel framework using Graph Neural Networks to generate protein representations by leveraging multiple perspectives and adaptively integrating them through a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enhancing performance in diverse protein-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based Protein Representation Learning methods rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, leading to incomplete protein representations due to capturing partial properties of residue interactions.

Method: The MMPG framework constructs graphs from multiple perspectives (physical, chemical, geometric) and uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module to capture perspective-specific features, synergies, and global consensus.

Result: MMPG improves protein representations by dynamically specializing experts to model interaction levels, achieving superior performance on four downstream protein tasks.

Conclusion: The multi-perspective graph construction and adaptive expert fusion enhance protein-related task performance, showcasing the importance of leveraging diverse residue interaction properties.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.

*Boaz Carmeli,Ron Meir,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a technique where artificial agents achieve compositional generalization to describe unseen images effectively using a two-step method involving decomposition and recomposition of image concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable artificial agents to mimic human-like compositionality, allowing the systematic recombination of known concepts to address novel tasks such as describing previously unseen images.

Method: The proposed 'Composition through Decomposition' approach comprises two stages: (1) Agents initially learn to break down an image into basic elements via a codebook in a multi-target coordination game (Decompose step). (2) Agents then use this codebook to generate complex phrases for novel images by recomposing the basic elements (Compose step).

Result: The approach demonstrates that agents can achieve compositional generalization, including zero-shot generalization, where they can compose descriptions for unseen images without additional training.

Conclusion: The study showcases that artificial agents can systematically combine learned concepts to interpret and describe unseen inputs effectively, paving the way for advanced generalization abilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Compositionality is a cognitive mechanism that allows humans to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways. This study demonstrates how artificial neural agents acquire and utilize compositional generalization to describe previously unseen images. Our method, termed "Composition through Decomposition", involves two sequential training steps. In the 'Decompose' step, the agents learn to decompose an image into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game. Subsequently, in the 'Compose' step, the agents employ this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases. Remarkably, we observe cases where generalization in the `Compose' step is achieved zero-shot, without the need for additional training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to resolve computational challenges in processing high and heterogeneous sampling rates of nEMG signals for near real-time analysis of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs).

Method: The authors propose a workflow that assesses downsampling's impact via shape-based distortion metrics and feature-based machine learning models, focusing on waveform integrity and classification performance in a three-class NMD classification task.

Result: The workflow successfully identifies downsampling configurations that maintain diagnostic signal integrity while significantly reducing computational overhead. Shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard methods by preserving signal morphology and peak structures.

Conclusion: The study offers practical strategies for designing downsampling processes that balance computational efficiency and diagnostic accuracy for nEMG analysis. The presented workflow is also generalizable to high-frequency time-series tasks beyond nEMG.

Abstract: Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.

### [30] [GFM4GA: Graph Foundation Model for Group Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10193)
*Jiujiu Chen,Weijun Zeng,Shaofeng Hu,Sihong Xie,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GFM4GA, a graph foundation model tailored for detecting group anomalies in networks, showcasing improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group anomaly detection is essential but complex due to varying anomaly patterns; existing GFMs excel at detecting individual anomalies but fail to generalize to group anomalies, necessitating a specialized approach.

Method: GFM4GA employs dual-level contrastive learning during pretraining to capture group anomaly structures and uses parameter-constrained, anomaly proportion-weighted settings in finetuning. It incorporates group contexts via labeled anomaly neighbors for better adaptability.

Result: Experiments reveal that GFM4GA achieves superior performance in group anomaly detection, outperforming existing methods by 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

Conclusion: GFM4GA effectively fills the gap in group anomaly detection by building on graph foundation models and leveraging specialized learning techniques for enhanced detection accuracy.

Abstract: Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

*Alex Dantart,Marco Kóvacs-Navarro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Topo-RAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that improves document processing by respecting their narrative and structural topology rather than linearizing data into plain text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems simplify complex, multidimensional enterprise datasets into linearized text strings, which fails to capture structural relationships adequately.

Method: The proposed Topo-RAG framework uses a dual architecture that separates fluid narrative processing via dense retrievers and tabular data processing through a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism.

Result: Topo-RAG demonstrated an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 for hybrid queries when tested on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus mimicking real-world data complexity.

Conclusion: Topo-RAG effectively improves search and understanding capabilities by respecting the inherent shape and relationships in multidimensional enterprise data.

Abstract: In enterprise datasets, documents are rarely pure. They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.
  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.

*Vansh Kapoor,Aman Gupta,Hao Chen,Anurag Beniwal,Jing Huang,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks) improves reasoning task efficiency by routing critical steps to larger models while allowing smaller models to handle routine steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cascading failures in multi-step reasoning tasks, which occur when one incorrect step compromises the entire solution.

Method: TRIM uses process reward models to identify critical steps and applies routing strategies based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints to allocate model resources effectively.

Result: TRIM achieves 5x higher cost efficiency on MATH-500 with basic strategies and matches top model performance with 80% fewer expensive tokens. On harder benchmarks like AIME, it achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency.

Conclusion: Step-level intervention fundamentally enhances inference efficiency, and TRIM generalizes effectively across mathematical reasoning tasks by optimizing cost and accuracy trade-offs at the step level.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

*Irina Abdullaeva,Anton Vasiliuk,Elizaveta Goncharova,Temurbek Rahmatullaev,Zagorulko Ivan,Maxim Kurkin,Andrey Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces NoReGeo, a benchmark to evaluate large language models’ (LLMs) intrinsic geometric understanding without involving reasoning or computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to assess if large language models (LLMs) can inherently encode spatial relationships and geometric properties directly, as existing benchmarks mainly focus on reasoning-based geometric problem-solving through algebra.

Method: They created NoReGeo, a benchmark with 2,500 trivial geometric problems across 25 categories. The tasks are designed to evaluate geometric understanding purely through spatial relationships, using binary classification tasks.

Result: Even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 achieved only up to 65% accuracy in these tasks, showing limitations in their geometric understanding. Ablation studies indicate fine-tuning alone does not improve such understanding.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack intrinsic geometric cognition. The paper identifies this gap and suggests the necessity for specialized training approaches to develop true geometric understanding in future models.

Abstract: We present NoReGeo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the intrinsic geometric understanding of large language models (LLMs) without relying on reasoning or algebraic computation. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.

### [34] [Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization with Reward Co-Evolution for Long-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10306)
*Xin Guan,Zijian Li,Shen Huang,Pengjun Xie,Jingren Zhou,Jiuxin Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization (EAPO), an advanced RL algorithm to address limitations in long-context reasoning tasks by improving evidence retrieval and supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning struggles with sparse rewards and lacks efficient mechanisms to penalize ungrounded guesses in long-context reasoning tasks, particularly in retrieving meaningful evidence.

Method: The authors introduce EAPO with key innovations: Group-Relative Evidence Reward for providing dense process supervision and Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution to refine reward models iteratively using outcome-consistent rollouts.

Result: EAPO significantly improves reasoning performance across eight benchmarks, addressing critical challenges in evidence retrieval during long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: EAPO effectively enhances long-context reasoning by tackling evidence retrieval bottlenecks, offering improved evidence supervision and outperforming SOTA methods.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.

*Cheng Lin Cheng,Ting Chuan Lin,Chai Kai Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces C-GRASP, a pipeline for improving heart rate variability (HRV) interpretation by addressing physiological hallucinations, using individual baselines and RSA-aware guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and clinical usability of HRV interpretation in AI systems by addressing challenges like physiological hallucinations, short-data instability, and population biases in current large language model (LLM) implementations.

Method: The authors propose an RAG-enhanced (retrieval-augmented generation) pipeline, named C-GRASP, to decompose HRV interpretation into eight reasoning steps, emphasizing individualized metrics and implementing RSA-aware automation. A priority hierarchy based on Z-scores tackles population bias.

Result: C-GRASP achieved enhanced emotion classification accuracy (37.3%) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6% in testing on the DREAMER dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of its individualized approach.

Conclusion: C-GRASP addresses the limitations of traditional HRV analysis using a transparent, evidence-based pipeline, enabling safer, more reliable AI applications in affective computing and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a pivotal noninvasive marker for autonomic monitoring; however, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations. These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the "population bias" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.

*Xuancheng Ren,Shijing Hu,Zhihui Lu,Jiangqi Huang,Qiang Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LatentRefusal, a mechanism to safely refuse unanswerable queries in LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, using hidden activations of the language model to predict query answerability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the safety concerns associated with incorrect and misleading outputs from unanswerable or ambiguous queries in text-to-SQL systems.

Method: Developing LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism, combined with a Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, to suppress schema noise and identify unanswerable queries effectively.

Result: Extensive empirical evaluations show improved accuracy (average F1 score of 88.5%) with minimal computational overhead (approx. 2 milliseconds) across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: LatentRefusal offers an effective and efficient safety mechanism for LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, enhancing both reliability and safety while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ML-Master 2.0, an AI agent designed for ultra-long-horizon autonomy, employing Hierarchical Cognitive Caching to handle context management challenges and outperform in long-term machine learning engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges associated with artificial intelligence's ultra-long-horizon autonomy necessary for sustained strategic and iterative correction in scientific processes.

Method: Introduce Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture allowing agents to manage, distill, and differentiate transient execution traces from stable knowledge for strategic long-term decision-making.

Result: In OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves 56.44% medal rate, surpassing previous state-of-the-art in machine learning engineering autonomy.

Conclusion: Ultra-long-horizon autonomy enabled by HCC offers scalable paths for advanced AI capable of self-driven exploration and strategic decision-making beyond human precedents.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents ErrEval, an error-aware evaluation framework for Automatic Question Generation (QG), addressing issues like factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. It improves evaluation with explicit error diagnostics in a two-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for Question Generation are insufficient as they lack explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of critical defects such as factual inaccuracies and overestimations of quality.

Method: ErrEval employs a two-stage evaluation approach: first, an Error Identifier detects structural, linguistic, and content-related errors. Then, its diagnostic signals serve as evidence for improved scoring using LLM evaluators.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that ErrEval improves alignment with human judgments and mitigates overestimation of low-quality questions.

Conclusion: ErrEval enhances QG evaluation by addressing critical defects through error-aware diagnostics, ensuring more reliable and human-aligned assessments compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LADFA, a computational framework to analyze privacy policies by processing text, extracting personal data flows, and generating data flow graphs using machine learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of understanding lengthy and complex privacy policies, which are often difficult for users to interpret due to legal language and inconsistencies, by automating the analysis process.

Method: It combines large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base. LADFA involves a pre-processor, LLM-based processor, and data flow post-processor to evaluate and analyze privacy policies.

Result: The framework was validated via a case study of privacy policies from the automotive sector, showing its accuracy and effectiveness for extracting and analyzing data flows.

Conclusion: LADFA is a versatile and customizable tool for text-based analysis, with potential applications beyond privacy policy evaluation.

Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.

TL;DR: The paper presents LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficiently aligning large language models at test time, outperforming traditional alignment methods and preserving generative diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning methods for aligning large language models are computationally expensive and inflexible, while existing test-time methods struggle with distorted signals and inefficiency.

Method: The authors propose LLMdoctor, utilizing a patient-doctor paradigm where token-level signals from a frozen patient model are extracted and used by a smaller doctor model via token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO).

Result: LLMdoctor achieves superior performance compared to existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses full fine-tuning methods such as DPO.

Conclusion: LLMdoctor provides an efficient and precise token-by-token alignment framework for LLMs while maintaining generative diversity, presenting a significant advancement over existing alignment approaches.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

TL;DR: NSR-Boost is a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework aimed at safely and efficiently upgrading legacy GBDT models in industrial environments, focusing on hard regions where predictions fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy GBDT models in high-concurrency industrial applications face high retraining costs and risks, necessitating a non-intrusive upgrade method that minimizes systemic disruptions.

Method: NSR-Boost identifies prediction failures in hard regions using residuals, creates interpretable expert models using LLM and Bayesian optimization, and integrates these experts dynamically with legacy outputs via a lightweight aggregator.

Result: The framework outperformed SOTA baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, while showing significant performance gains on real-world data in financial risk control applications.

Conclusion: NSR-Boost safely improves legacy models with low costs, capturing risks missed by traditional models and providing a reliable evolutionary framework for industrial use.

Abstract: Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being "non-intrusive". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on "hard regions" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task called Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF) to enrich domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) using general knowledge graphs (GKGs). It proposes a simple and effective framework called ExeFuse to address issues of domain relevance and knowledge granularity.

Motivation: Domain-specific knowledge graphs often lack sufficient coverage compared to general knowledge graphs, necessitating a method to enrich DKGs effectively while resolving challenges like domain relevance and granularity misalignment.

Method: The authors propose ExeFuse, a Fact-as-Program paradigm that maps general knowledge facts to granularity-aware operators and assesses their domain relevance using a probabilistic framework by checking program executability on the DKG.

Result: They construct two benchmarks (DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I)) with 21 evaluation configurations and conduct extensive experiments to validate the framework's effectiveness and the importance of the DKGF task.

Conclusion: ExeFuse provides a successful method for enriching domain-specific knowledge graphs through domain relevance verification and granularity alignment, and the work introduces standardized benchmarks for this research area.

Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm. It treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues. We construct two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 evaluation configurations. Extensive experiments validate the task's importance and our model's effectiveness, providing the first standardized testbed for DKGF.

### [44] [Breaking Up with Normatively Monolithic Agency with GRACE: A Reason-Based Neuro-Symbolic Architecture for Safe and Ethical AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10520)
*Felix Jahn,Yannic Muskalla,Lisa Dargasz,Patrick Schramowski,Kevin Baum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRACE, a neuro-symbolic architecture to ensure AI agents' moral and normative compliance in decision-making by separating normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure autonomous AI agents are not only effective but also normatively aligned, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Developed a three-module architecture called GRACE: 1) Moral Module (MM) uses deontic logic for permissible actions; 2) Decision-Making Module (DMM) optimizes actions while adhering to MM guidance; 3) Guard ensures compliance.

Result: Demonstrated the architecture on an LLM-based therapy assistant, providing interpretability, contestability, and moral alignment.

Conclusion: GRACE's design enables enhanced oversight, explainability, and ethical behavior in autonomous AI systems via a structured neuro-symbolic approach.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

### [45] [Diagnosing Generalization Failures in Fine-Tuned LLMs: A Cross-Architectural Study on Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10524)
*Frank Bobe,Gregory D. Vetaw,Chase Pavlick,Darshan Bryner,Matthew Cook,Jose Salas-Vernis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates generalization failures in fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces a diagnostic framework using SHAP analysis and interpretability. It provides insights into architecture, data diversity, and training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing generalization failures in fine-tuned Large Language Models is crucial, as it limits reliable performance on specialized tasks.

Method: The study employs a multi-layered diagnostic framework on various LLM architectures (Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral) using techniques like SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability, with a focus on phishing detection.

Result: The findings highlight that generalization relies on architecture and data diversity, is highly dependent on architecture, and that some architectures inherently generalize better. Specific examples are provided, such as Mistral's resilience and Llama 3.1's failure with diverse data.

Conclusion: Reliable AI requires evaluating the interaction between model architecture, data diversity, and training strategies. The proposed methodology effectively pinpoints reasons for generalization failures, helping advance model robustness and performance.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper provides a multidimensional safety evaluation of frontier language and vision models, revealing heterogeneous safety performances and emphasizing the need for standardized assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate whether rapid advancements in reasoning, perception, and generative capabilities in LLMs and MLLMs are accompanied by equivalent improvements in safety.

Method: A unified evaluation protocol measuring safety was applied to 7 frontier models across language, vision-language, and image generation modalities, integrating benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations.

Result: Findings show diverse trade-offs in models' safety performances across modalities, with vulnerability in adversarial settings, particularly for multilingual models and adversarial prompts.

Conclusion: Safety in large models is multidimensional and modality-dependent, requiring standardized evaluations to minimize risks and guide ethical model development.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

### [47] [Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via In-Decoding Safety-Awareness Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10543)
*Yinzhi Zhao,Ming Wang,Shi Feng,Xiaocui Yang,Daling Wang,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance large language models' safety by leveraging their latent safety signals during decoding to counter jailbreak attacks while maintaining utility and response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the limitations of current safety mechanisms for LLMs, which struggle with sophisticated jailbreaks, often degrading performance or failing robustly to detect unsafe outputs.

Method: They identify latent safety-related signals in LLMs during decoding and propose leveraging these for early unsafe content detection, offering a new way to utilize intrinsic safety signals.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in safety against jailbreak attacks while keeping low rates of over-refusal and preserving response quality.

Conclusion: Activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding is an effective complementary approach to enhance LLM safety against jailbreaks without compromising utility. Code is provided for further exploration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the importance of studying collective behavior in systems with multiple agents based on large language models (LLMs), suggesting this has societal risks and benefits. It proposes an interactionist paradigm to explore how these models use pre-trained knowledge and social priors in emerging phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for understanding the societal impact, risks, and benefits of collective behaviors in systems using large language models, which inherit pre-trained knowledge and adapt through learning.

Method: The authors advocate for an interactionist paradigm and propose four focus areas in theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogues for tackling emergent phenomena in LLM-based collectives.

Result: The paper identifies theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical frameworks critical for studying multi-agent systems using LLMs, enabling insights into collective behavior.

Conclusion: Investigating LLM-based collective systems requires new paradigms to understand how embedded values and social contexts contribute to emergent phenomena, highlighting theoretical and interdisciplinary approaches.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the extraction and utilization of genomic information for biomedical research, overcoming challenges posed by complex distributed databases.

Method: A multi-agent framework named GenomAgent coordinating specialized agents for complex genomics queries.

Result: GenomAgent outperforms GeneGPT by 12% on average, based on evaluations on nine tasks from the GeneTuring benchmark.

Abstract: Comprehending genomic information is essential for biomedical research, yet extracting data from complex distributed databases remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for genomic Question Answering (QA) but face limitations due to restricted access to domain-specific databases. GeneGPT is the current state-of-the-art system that enhances LLMs by utilizing specialized API calls, though it is constrained by rigid API dependencies and limited adaptability. We replicate GeneGPT and propose GenomAgent, a multi-agent framework that efficiently coordinates specialized agents for complex genomics queries. Evaluated on nine tasks from the GeneTuring benchmark, GenomAgent outperforms GeneGPT by 12% on average, and its flexible architecture extends beyond genomics to various scientific domains needing expert knowledge extraction.

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient method for LTLf synthesis with multiple properties by computing maximal realizable sets through a symbolic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LTLf synthesis methods struggle to handle cases where satisfying all properties is impossible, often resorting to enumerating subsets of properties which is inefficient.

Method: A fully symbolic algorithm is proposed using Boolean goal variables and leveraging monotonicity to represent complex goal combinations compactly, all within a single fixed-point computation.

Result: The proposed approach achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedups over enumeration-based methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that symbolic computation can significantly improve the efficiency of LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, making it scalable for complex scenarios.

Abstract: We study LTLf synthesis with multiple properties, where satisfying all properties may be impossible. Instead of enumerating subsets of properties, we compute in one fixed-point computation the relation between product-game states and the goal sets that are realizable from them, and we synthesize strategies achieving maximal realizable sets. We develop a fully symbolic algorithm that introduces Boolean goal variables and exploits monotonicity to represent exponentially many goal combinations compactly. Our approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.

### [51] [Are Your Reasoning Models Reasoning or Guessing? A Mechanistic Analysis of Hierarchical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10679)
*Zirui Ren,Ziming Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), highlighting challenges in reasoning patterns and proposing strategies to enhance its performance, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and improve the reasoning patterns and performance of HRM, which outperforms other reasoning models but still exhibits certain failures and limitations.

Method: The authors conducted a mechanistic study to identify limitations in HRM's reasoning abilities, then designed strategies like data augmentation, input perturbation, and model bootstrapping to improve its performance.

Result: By employing these strategies, they created an Augmented HRM that improved the accuracy of solving Sudoku-Extreme puzzles from 54.5% to 96.9%.

Conclusion: The study identifies issues with HRM's "guessing" approach rather than proper reasoning and offers scalable strategies to address these. It also provides insights into the inner workings of reasoning models.

Abstract: Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) "Grokking" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM "guesses" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be "guessing" instead of "reasoning". Leveraging this "guessing" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models "reason".

### [52] [Structure and Diversity Aware Context Bubble Construction for Enterprise Retrieval Augmented Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10681)
*Amir Khurshid,Abhishek Sehgal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for creating efficient context bubbles for LLMs, improving coherence, citation, and reducing redundancy compared to traditional top-k retrieval methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for constructing LLM contexts, like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), face challenges such as fragmented information graphs, duplication of content, and insufficient query context coverage.

Method: The proposed method uses structured-informed retrieval and diversity-constrained selection to assemble coherent bundles of spans using high-relevance anchors, applying task-conditioned structural priors and balancing query relevance, coverage, and redundancy under a strict token budget.

Result: Experiments on enterprise documents show significant improvements in reducing redundancy, better coverage of secondary facets, and enhanced answer quality and citation faithfulness within limited context windows.

Conclusion: Both structural priors and diversity constraints are critical for effective context bubble construction, as their removal leads to diminished coverage and increased redundancy or incomplete information.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.

*Han Jiang,Yao Xiao,Rachel Hurley,Shichao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study investigates GenAI's impact on performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural tasks, finding it benefits novices but reduces creative self-efficacy overall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to explore how generative AI influences design outcomes and psychological factors in architectural tasks, addressing gaps in understanding its utility based on user expertise and interactions.

Method: 36 students performed design tasks with and without GenAI, with experts rating the results and participants self-reporting on creative self-efficacy and cognitive load. Difference-in-differences and subgroup analyses were used.

Result: GenAI showed no overall performance gain but improved novice outcomes. Creative self-efficacy dropped for GenAI users, and cognitive load variations were connected to specific GenAI prompt strategies.

Conclusion: GenAI's effectiveness is influenced by the user's expertise and their interaction strategies, offering potential benefits for novices but highlighting areas for improved GenAI integration.

Abstract: Our study examines how generative AI (GenAI) influences performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural conceptual design tasks. Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SparseLUT, a framework enhancing LUT-based DNNs for resource-constrained edge devices by optimizing architecture and training, achieving reduced resource usage, latency, and improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge devices need DNN deployment that balances accuracy and resource constraints, but existing LUT-based DNNs face exponential LUT growth and inefficient connectivity issues.

Method: SparseLUT employs architectural enhancements combining multiple PolyLUT sub-neurons via an adder, reducing LUT usage and latency. It also introduces a non-greedy training algorithm for better input pruning and regrowth.

Result: The approach reduces LUT usage by 2.0x-13.9x, inference latency by 1.2x-1.6x, and achieves accuracy gains of up to 2.13% on MNIST and 0.94% on Jet Substructure Classification.

Conclusion: SparseLUT demonstrates a comprehensive solution, overcoming major challenges of LUT-based DNNs, enabling efficient and high-performance edge device deployment.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices such as FPGAs requires a careful balance among latency, power, and hardware resource usage, while maintaining high accuracy. Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs -- such as LogicNets, PolyLUT, and NeuraLUT -- face two critical challenges: the exponential growth of LUT size and inefficient random sparse connectivity. This paper presents SparseLUT, a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges through two orthogonal optimizations. First, we propose an architectural enhancement that aggregates multiple PolyLUT sub-neurons via an adder, significantly reducing LUT consumption by 2.0x-13.9x and lowering inference latency by 1.2x-1.6x, all while maintaining comparable accuracy. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce a non-greedy training algorithm that optimizes neuron connectivity by selectively pruning less significant inputs and strategically regrowing more effective ones. This training optimization, which incurs no additional area and latency overhead, delivers consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks -- achieving up to a 2.13% gain on MNIST and 0.94% on Jet Substructure Classification compared to existing LUT-DNN approaches.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the architectural challenges of XR workload diversity by profiling tasks and proposing design guidelines for XR SoCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in delivering ultra-low-latency and efficient XR performance under power/area constraints due to the increasing diversity of XR workloads.

Method: The authors classify XR workloads using high-level design space exploration and empirical profiling of 12 XR kernels on commercial GPUs and CPUs.

Result: It identifies XR workload archetypes and extracts architectural insights to propose design strategies for improved XR SoCs.

Conclusion: Design approaches for XR systems should move from resource scaling toward phase-aware scheduling and elastic resource allocation for enhanced energy efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Edge and mobile platforms for augmented and virtual reality, collectively referred to as extended reality (XR) must deliver deterministic ultra-low-latency performance under stringent power and area constraints. However, the diversity of XR workloads is rapidly increasing, characterized by heterogeneous operator types and complex dataflow structures. This trend poses significant challenges to conventional accelerator architectures centered around convolutional neural networks (CNNs), resulting in diminishing returns for traditional compute-centric optimization strategies. Despite the importance of this problem, a systematic architectural understanding of the full XR pipeline remains lacking. In this paper, we present an architectural classification of XR workloads using a cross-layer methodology that integrates model-based high-level design space exploration (DSE) with empirical profiling on commercial GPU and CPU hardware. By analyzing a representative set of workloads spanning 12 distinct XR kernels, we distill their complex architectural characteristics into a small set of cross-layer workload archetypes (e.g., capacity-limited and overhead-sensitive). Building on these archetypes, we further extract key architectural insights and provide actionable design guidelines for next-generation XR SoCs. Our study highlights that XR architecture design must shift from generic resource scaling toward phase-aware scheduling and elastic resource allocation in order to achieve greater energy efficiency and high performance in future XR systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes ProUtt, a method to synthesize data for better prediction of user utterances in human-machine dialogues by modeling intent reasoning more explicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns, computational expense, and limitations of existing user simulator methods which fail to advance dialogue or effectively model intent reasoning for next utterance predictions.

Method: ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree to model intent reasoning trajectories, employs path prediction via exploitation and exploration, and synthesizes preference and non-preference reasoning scenarios by revising intent paths.

Result: ProUtt outperformed existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial APIs for next utterance prediction across four benchmark datasets, validated through both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations.

Conclusion: ProUtt provides a practical and efficient solution to proactive next utterance prediction, improving over existing methods and addressing intent reasoning challenges while sharing resources for future research.

Abstract: Proactively predicting a users next utterance in human-machine dialogue can streamline interaction and improve user experience. Existing commercial API-based solutions are subject to privacy concerns while deploying general-purpose LLMs locally remains computationally expensive. As such, training a compact, task-specific LLM provides a practical alternative. Although user simulator methods can predict a user's next utterance, they mainly imitate their speaking style rather than advancing the dialogue. Preference data synthesis has been investigated to generate data for proactive next utterance prediction and help align LLMs with user preferences. Yet existing methods lack the ability to explicitly model the intent reasoning that leads to the user's next utterance and to define and synthesize preference and non-preference reasoning processes for predicting the user's next utterance.To address these challenges, we propose ProUtt, an LLM-driven preference data synthesis method for proactive next utterance prediction. ProUtt converts dialogue history into an intent tree and explicitly models intent reasoning trajectories by predicting the next plausible path from both exploitation and exploration perspectives. It then constructs preference and non-preference reasoning processes by perturbing or revising intent tree paths at different future turns. Extensive evaluations using LLM-as-a-judge and human judgments demonstrate that ProUtt consistently outperforms existing data synthesis methods, user simulators, and commercial LLM APIs across four benchmark datasets. We release both the code and the synthesized datasets to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address concerns about the lack of creativity and originality in AI-generated research using single-step prompting, particularly the issue of "smart plagiarism." This research aims to determine whether iterative reasoning-based approaches can produce more genuinely novel and feasible research proposals.

Method: The authors benchmarked five reasoning architectures (reflection-based refinement, Sakana AI v2 evolutionary algorithm, Google Co-Scientist, GPT recursive decomposition, and Gemini multimodal pipeline) using thirty research proposals each. They evaluated these workflows for novelty, feasibility, and impact.

Result: The results show that decomposition-based and long-context workflows scored the highest on novelty (mean 4.17/5), while reflection-based methods scored significantly lower (2.33/5). These workflows maintained feasibility without compromising creativity and showed variability across research domains.

Conclusion: The study concludes that multi-stage agentic workflows, particularly those focusing on decomposition and long-context analysis, can effectively enhance the novelty and feasibility of AI-driven research ideation, addressing concerns of smart plagiarism in single-step systems.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the scientific ecosystem raises fundamental questions about the creativity and originality of AI-generated research. Recent work has identified ``smart plagiarism'' as a concern in single-step prompting approaches, where models reproduce existing ideas with terminological shifts. This paper investigates whether agentic workflows -- multi-step systems employing iterative reasoning, evolutionary search, and recursive decomposition -- can generate more novel and feasible research plans. We benchmark five reasoning architectures: Reflection-based iterative refinement, Sakana AI v2 evolutionary algorithms, Google Co-Scientist multi-agent framework, GPT Deep Research (GPT-5.1) recursive decomposition, and Gemini~3 Pro multimodal long-context pipeline. Using evaluations from thirty proposals each on novelty, feasibility, and impact, we find that decomposition-based and long-context workflows achieve mean novelty of 4.17/5, while reflection-based approaches score significantly lower (2.33/5). Results reveal varied performance across research domains, with high-performing workflows maintaining feasibility without sacrificing creativity. These findings support the view that carefully designed multi-stage agentic workflows can advance AI-assisted research ideation.

Chatbots have evolved into sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of automating complex workflows, including policy recommendation and claims triage, while simultaneously enabling dynamic, context-aware user engagement. This paper presents the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of Axlerod, an AI-powered conversational interface designed to improve the operational efficiency of independent insurance agents. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and domain-specific knowledge integration, Axlerod demonstrates robust capabilities in parsing user intent, accessing structured policy databases, and delivering real-time, contextually relevant responses. Experimental results underscore Axlerod's effectiveness, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.18% in policy retrieval tasks while reducing the average search time by 2.42 seconds. This work contributes to the growing body of research on enterprise-grade AI applications in insurtech, with a particular focus on agent-assistive rather than consumer-facing architectures.

*Yiwei Yan,Hao Li,Hua He,Gong Kai,Zhengyi Yang,Guanfeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SALP-CG, a classification and grading pipeline utilizing large language models (LLMs) to assess the privacy risks of conversational health data, achieving high accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of unified standards and reliable automated approaches in classifying and grading the sensitivity of conversational health data, especially in health-related online consultations.

Method: The SALP-CG pipeline combines few-shot guidance, JSON Schema constrained decoding, and deterministic high-risk rules to classify and grade sensitivity levels of data. It follows GB/T 39725-2020 standards and is evaluated using the MedDialog-CN benchmark.

Result: The pipeline demonstrates strong category compliance, accurate sensitivity grading, and robust entity extraction across LLMs. The best-performing model achieves a micro-F1 score of 0.900 at the highest sensitivity level, identifying that sensitive levels 2-3 dominate while levels 4-5, though less frequent, carry significant risks.

Conclusion: SALP-CG provides an effective and practical method for the classification and sensitivity grading of conversational health data, thus contributing to enhanced health data governance.

Abstract: Online medical consultations generate large volumes of conversational health data that often embed protected health information, requiring robust methods to classify data categories and assign risk levels in line with policies and practice. However, existing approaches lack unified standards and reliable automated methods to fulfill sensitivity classification for such conversational health data. This study presents a large language model-based extraction pipeline, SALP-CG, for classifying and grading privacy risks in online conversational health data. We concluded health-data classification and grading rules in accordance with GB/T 39725-2020. Combining few-shot guidance, JSON Schema constrained decoding, and deterministic high-risk rules, the backend-agnostic extraction pipeline achieves strong category compliance and reliable sensitivity across diverse LLMs. On the MedDialog-CN benchmark, models yields robust entity counts, high schema compliance, and accurate sensitivity grading, while the strongest model attains micro-F1=0.900 for maximum-level prediction. The category landscape stratified by sensitivity shows that Level 2-3 items dominate, enabling re-identification when combined; Level 4-5 items are less frequent but carry outsize harm. SALP-CG reliably helps classify categories and grading sensitivity in online conversational health data across LLMs, offering a practical method for health data governance.

*Jing-Yi Zeng,Guan-Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores building a domain-specific LLM for statistical reasoning using LLaMA-3.2-3B, comparing different training pipelines for specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to create an efficient and specialized LLM tailored for statistical tasks while addressing struggles in aligning domain expertise with general reasoning.

Method: It employs iterative pipelines including continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and careful downstream task adaptation.

Result: Starting with an instruction-tuned FM yields effective domain specialization, with the StatLLaMA model balancing statistical expertise, common-sense reasoning, and mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: The research outlines a guideline for developing resource-efficient, specialized statistical LLMs, demonstrating the importance of initial instruction tuning and minimal downstream fine-tuning.

Abstract: This study investigates how to efficiently build a domain-specialized large language model (LLM) for statistics using the lightweight LLaMA-3.2-3B family as the foundation model (FM). We systematically compare three multi-stage training pipelines, starting from a base FM with no instruction-following capability, a base FM augmented with post-hoc instruction tuning, and an instruction-tuned FM with strong general reasoning abilities across continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) preference alignment, and downstream task adaptation. Results show that pipelines beginning with a base FM fail to develop meaningful statistical reasoning, even after extensive instruction tuning, SFT, or RLHF alignment. In contrast, starting from LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct enables effective domain specialization. A comprehensive evaluation of SFT variants reveals clear trade-offs between domain expertise and general reasoning ability. We further demonstrate that direct preference optimization provides stable and effective RLHF preference alignment. Finally, we show that downstream fine-tuning must be performed with extremely low intensity to avoid catastrophic forgetting in highly optimized models. The final model, StatLLaMA, achieves strong and balanced performance on benchmarks of mathematical reasoning, common-sense reasoning, and statistical expertise, offering a practical blueprint for developing resource-efficient statistical LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/HuangDLab/StatLLaMA.

*Hoyoon Byun,Youngjun Choi,Taero Kim,Sungrae Park,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT) to address stability and efficiency issues in Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) used in large language models, achieving better training speed and inference performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inefficiency and fragility of Pre-LN in deep layers, along with existing normalization-free methods like Dynamic Tanh failing to ensure stability at depth, motivated the proposed approach.

Method: The paper proposes BHyT, using a tanh nonlinearity with input bounding to constrain activations, combined with an efficient statistical calculation strategy for stability and speed.

Result: BHyT achieves 15.8% faster training, 4.2% higher token generation throughput, matching or exceeding inference performance and robustness benchmarks compared to RMSNorm.

Conclusion: BHyT is a stable and efficient alternative to Pre-LN, improving pretraining and inference performance for large language models.

Abstract: Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN) is the de facto choice for large language models (LLMs) and is crucial for stable pretraining and effective transfer learning. However, Pre-LN is inefficient due to repeated statistical calculations and suffers from the curse of depth. As layers grow, the magnitude and variance of the hidden state escalate, destabilizing training. Efficiency-oriented normalization-free methods such as Dynamic Tanh (DyT) improve speed but remain fragile at depth. To jointly address stability and efficiency, we propose Bounded Hyperbolic Tanh (BHyT), a drop-in replacement for Pre-LN. BHyT couples a tanh nonlinearity with explicit, data-driven input bounding to keep activations within a non-saturating range. It prevents depth-wise growth in activation magnitude and variance and comes with a theoretical stability guarantee. For efficiency, BHyT computes exact statistics once per block and replaces a second normalization with a lightweight variance approximation, enhancing efficiency. Empirically, BHyT demonstrates improved stability and efficiency during pretraining, achieving an average of 15.8% faster training and an average of 4.2% higher token generation throughput compared to RMSNorm., while matching or surpassing its inference performance and robustness across language understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-aware, dynamic knowledge graph-based QA system, aiming to handle incomplete, noisy, and uncertain evidence during question answering (QA), especially in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QA systems struggle due to static, deterministic knowledge graph (KG) representations that fail to account for evolving information and uncertainty, particularly in critical domains like healthcare.

Method: The authors propose a framework that dynamically constructs evolving KGs, includes confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanisms, and provides an interactive interface for QA users.

Result: The system was applied to healthcare, creating personalized KGs from patient electronic health records, visualizing uncertainties, and demonstrating its value in a mortality prediction task.

Conclusion: This uncertainty-aware KG framework enhances QA system reliability and interpretability, particularly for high-stakes domains like healthcare, by effectively modeling and visualizing uncertainty.

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are increasingly deployed across domains. However, their reliability is undermined when retrieved evidence is incomplete, noisy, or uncertain. Existing knowledge graph (KG) based QA frameworks typically represent facts as static and deterministic, failing to capture the evolving nature of information and the uncertainty inherent in reasoning. We present a demonstration of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs, a framework that combines (i) dynamic construction of evolving KGs, (ii) confidence scoring and uncertainty-aware retrieval, and (iii) an interactive interface for reliable and interpretable QA. Our system highlights how uncertainty modeling can make QA more robust and transparent by enabling users to explore dynamic graphs, inspect confidence-annotated triples, and compare baseline versus confidence-aware answers. The target users of this demo are clinical data scientists and clinicians, and we instantiate the framework in healthcare: constructing personalized KGs from electronic health records, visualizing uncertainty across patient visits, and evaluating its impact on a mortality prediction task. This use case demonstrates the broader promise of uncertainty-aware dynamic KGs for enhancing QA reliability in high-stakes applications.

### [64] [Cross-Platform Evaluation of Large Language Model Safety in Pediatric Consultations: Evolution of Adversarial Robustness and the Scale Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09721)
*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in pediatric medical consultations under adversarial conditions driven by parental anxiety, revealing that smaller models often outperform larger ones in safety metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing use of LLMs in medical settings, the study sought to investigate their safety under realistic, high-pressure user conditions, specifically in pediatric cases involving anxious parental queries.

Method: The study used PediatricAnxietyBench with 300 queries (authentic and adversarial) across 10 topics, evaluating three models via APIs for safety using a scoring system based on restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior.

Result: Findings revealed average safety scores ranging from 9.70 to 10.39, with smaller models outperforming larger ones. Models showed improvement under adversarial conditions, though vulnerabilities like incorrect seizure diagnoses and lack of emergency recognition persist.

Conclusion: The study concludes that safety in LLMs depends more on model alignment and architecture than size, with improvements in robustness noted across releases. It highlights the importance of adversarial testing and suggests current LLMs are unsuitable for emergency medical triage.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical consultations, yet their safety under realistic user pressures remains understudied. Prior assessments focused on neutral conditions, overlooking vulnerabilities from anxious users challenging safeguards. This study evaluated LLM safety under parental anxiety-driven adversarial pressures in pediatric consultations across models and platforms. Methods PediatricAnxietyBench, from a prior evaluation, includes 300 queries (150 authentic, 150 adversarial) spanning 10 topics. Three models were assessed via APIs: Llama-3.3-70B and Llama-3.1-8B (Groq), Mistral-7B (HuggingFace), yielding 900 responses. Safety used a 0-15 scale for restraint, referral, hedging, emergency recognition, and non-prescriptive behavior. Analyses employed paired t-tests with bootstrapped CIs. Results Mean scores: 9.70 (Llama-3.3-70B) to 10.39 (Mistral-7B). Llama-3.1-8B outperformed Llama-3.3-70B by +0.66 (p=0.0001, d=0.225). Models showed positive adversarial effects, Mistral-7B strongest (+1.09, p=0.0002). Safety generalized across platforms; Llama-3.3-70B had 8% failures. Seizures vulnerable (33% inappropriate diagnoses). Hedging predicted safety (r=0.68, p<0.001). Conclusions Evaluation shows safety depends on alignment and architecture over scale, with smaller models outperforming larger. Evolution to robustness across releases suggests targeted training progress. Vulnerabilities and no emergency recognition indicate unsuitability for triage. Findings guide selection, stress adversarial testing, and provide open benchmark for medical AI safety.

*Franciszek Górski,Andrzej Czyżewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper outlines a framework using multilingual LLM (Llama3.1) for annotating Polish medical texts as part of ADMEDVOICE project. Achieved high classifier performance (F1 > 0.80) via smaller BERT-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing resource scarcity for annotating Polish medical texts to enabling multi-class classification in healthcare-related categories.

Method: Developed an annotation framework using multilingual Llama3.1 and trained/tested medical text classifiers with BERT-based architectures: DistilBERT, BioBERT, and HerBERT.

Result: DistilBERT achieved significant results; F1 > 0.93 in 3 categories and > 0.80 overall. Models are highly efficient alternatives versus larger LLMs.

Conclusion: The approach produced effective classifiers for Polish medical texts, showcasing efficiency over larger LLMs in terms of size, GPU usage, and inference speed.

Abstract: In this work, we present an annotation framework that demonstrates how a multilingual LLM pretrained on a large corpus can be used as a teacher model to distill the expert knowledge needed for tagging medical texts in Polish. This work is part of a larger project called ADMEDVOICE, within which we collected an extensive corpus of medical texts representing five clinical categories - Radiology, Oncology, Cardiology, Hypertension, and Pathology. Using this data, we had to develop a multi-class classifier, but the fundamental problem turned out to be the lack of resources for annotating an adequate number of texts. Therefore, in our solution, we used the multilingual Llama3.1 model to annotate an extensive corpus of medical texts in Polish. Using our limited annotation resources, we verified only a portion of these labels, creating a test set from them. The data annotated in this way were then used for training and validation of 3 different types of classifiers based on the BERT architecture - the distilled DistilBERT model, BioBERT fine-tuned on medical data, and HerBERT fine-tuned on the Polish language corpus. Among the models we trained, the DistilBERT model achieved the best results, reaching an F1 score > 0.80 for each clinical category and an F1 score > 0.93 for 3 of them. In this way, we obtained a series of highly effective classifiers that represent an alternative to large language models, due to their nearly 500 times smaller size, 300 times lower GPU VRAM consumption, and several hundred times faster inference.

### [66] [SagaScale: A Realistic, Scalable, and High-Quality Long-Context Benchmark Built from Full-Length Novels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09723)
*Guancheng Du,Yong Hu,Wenqing Wang,Yaming Yang,Jiaheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SagaScale introduces a high-quality benchmark built from full-length novels for testing LLMs with very long contexts (250K+ tokens). Evaluations show challenges for most LLMs, with some promising methods and models identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges LLMs face in understanding long, complex documents and improve existing long-context benchmarks in realism, scalability, and quality.

Method: An automated pipeline curates bilingual question-answer pairs from full-length novels using external resources like Wikipedia for benchmark construction only, not evaluation. The benchmark supports context lengths exceeding 250K tokens (English) and 320K tokens (Chinese).

Result: Evaluations of 12 LLMs and three long-context methods (Naïve RAG, Agentic RAG, Long Context) indicate full context usage is highly effective, Gemini-2.5-Pro performs well, and Agentic RAG addresses retrieval bottlenecks in Naïve RAG.

Conclusion: SagaScale facilitates long-context benchmarking by providing a scalable and realistic solution. Despite some progress, most LLMs encounter difficulties with lengthy contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress, but understanding long and complex documents remains challenging. Many long-context benchmarks have been proposed, but they face several limitations, including task realism, data scalability, and data quality. To this end, we introduce SagaScale, a realistic, scalable, and high-quality long-context benchmark built from full-length novels. The entire benchmark is constructed using an automated data collection pipeline that utilizes external resources (e.g., Wikipedia pages) to curate question-answer pairs. Critically, these external resources are provided only for benchmark construction and not during evaluation, which allows LLMs to curate complex questions that go beyond what they can answer during evaluation. SagaScale is also bilingual and offers the largest context length to date, with average token counts exceeding 250K for English novels and 320K for Chinese novels. Our evaluation across 12 frontier LLMs and three long-context methods -- Naïve RAG, Agentic RAG, and Long Context -- yields key insights, including: (1) Directly supplying the full context to the LLM can outperform other methods by a large margin; (2) Most LLMs still struggle with lengthy contexts, but Gemini-2.5-Pro stands out as an exception; and (3) Agentic RAG effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in Naïve RAG. Finally, we publicly release the SagaScale benchmark and our data collection codebase to facilitate future research.

### [67] [Syntactic Framing Fragility: An Audit of Robustness in LLM Ethical Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09724)
*Katherine Elkins,Jon Chun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how logical but syntactic prompt changes impact LLMs' ethical judgments and introduces a robustness evaluation framework called Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and ensure ethical robustness in LLMs, particularly their response consistency across varying syntactic framings in high-stakes decision-making contexts.

Method: Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN) is introduced to evaluate models against syntactically varied prompts. A systematic study includes 23 LLMs across multiple ethics scenarios under controlled conditions, analyzing 39,975 decisions.

Result: Widespread inconsistencies were found in ethical judgments across models, with open-source models being more fragile. Negation sensitivity was extreme in some models, though chain-of-thought reasoning reduced fragility.

Conclusion: Syntactic consistency is critical for ethical robustness, and SFF audits should be standard for evaluating LLMs' safety in decision-making applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential decision-making settings, yet their robustness to benign prompt variation remains underexplored. In this work, we study whether LLMs maintain consistent ethical judgments across logically equivalent but syntactically different prompts, focusing on variations involving negation and conditional structure. We introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF), a robustness evaluation framework that isolates purely syntactic effects via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN), enabling direct comparison of decisions across positive and negative framings without semantic drift. Auditing 23 state-of-the-art models spanning the U.S. and China as well as small U.S. open-source software models over 14 ethical scenarios and four controlled framings (39,975 decisions), we find widespread and statistically significant inconsistency: many models reverse ethical endorsements solely due to syntactic polarity, with open-source models exhibiting over twice the fragility of commercial counterparts. We further uncover extreme negation sensitivity, where some models endorse actions in 80-97% of cases when explicitly prompted with "should not." We show that eliciting chain-of-thought reasoning substantially reduces fragility, identifying a practical mitigation lever, and we map fragility across scenarios, finding higher risk in financial and business contexts than in medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that syntactic consistency constitutes a distinct and critical dimension of ethical robustness, and we argue that SFF-style audits should be a standard component of safety evaluation for deployed LLMs. Code and results will be available on github.com.

*Kaustubh Shivshankar Shejole,Sourabh Deoghare,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Virām, a benchmark to assess punctuation robustness in machine translation for English-to-Marathi. It finds fine-tuned models improve over standard baselines for preserving meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine translation quality in low- to middle-resource languages, focusing on resolving ambiguities caused by punctuation.

Method: Introduction of Virām benchmark with 54 manually-curated test cases, applying a restore-then-translate pipeline and fine-tuning models on varied punctuation data.

Result: Fine-tuned and pipeline models improved translation quality for punctuation-ambiguous texts compared to baselines. LLMs showed weaker performance.

Conclusion: Addressing punctuation ambiguity via specialized benchmarks and models leads to significant reliability improvements in machine translation. Further research into LLMs is required.

Abstract: Punctuation plays a critical role in resolving semantic and structural ambiguity in written language. Machine Translation (MT) systems are now widely applied across diverse domains and languages, including many low-resource settings. In this work, we focus on Marathi, a low- to middle-resource language. We introduce Virām, the first diagnostic benchmark for assessing punctuation robustness in English-to-Marathi machine translation, consisting of 54 manually curated, punctuation-ambiguous instances. We evaluate two primary strategies for enhancing reliability: a pipeline-based restore-then-translate approach and direct fine-tuned on punctuation-varied data. Our results demonstrate that specialized fine-tuned models and pipeline systems significantly improve translation quality over standard baselines on the Virām benchmark. Qualitative analysis reveals that the original model may result in wrong translations leading to wrong interpretations, while fine-tuned models significantly improve overall reliability. Furthermore, we find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) lag behind these task-specific approaches in preserving meaning for punctuation-ambiguous text, thus necessitating further research in this area.

*Hien Tran,Quinten Steenhuis,Alexandros Christoforos,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reinterprets forgetting in large language models (LLMs) as a beneficial mechanism, drawing from human memory dynamics, and proposes strategies for improved reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception of forgetting in LLMs as a limitation and explore its potential advantages by drawing inspiration from human memory mechanisms.

Method: The paper models LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process with exponential decay. It introduces benchmarks for temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, and proposes a probabilistic memory prompting strategy.

Result: The study reveals that LLM forgetting rates resemble human trade-offs in memory efficiency between stability and adaptability, and probabilistic memory prompting improves long-term reasoning.

Conclusion: Forgetting in LLMs can be reframed as an adaptive mechanism, providing insights for enhancing reasoning processes by mimicking human-like memory decay.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often evaluated against ideals of perfect Bayesian inference, yet growing evidence suggests that their in-context reasoning exhibits systematic forgetting of past information. Rather than viewing this behavior as a limitation, we reinterpret forgetting as a functional cognitive mechanism. Drawing inspiration from human memory dynamics, we model LLM inference as a probabilistic memory process governed by exponential decay. We introduce a benchmark suite that evaluates temporal reasoning, concept drift adaptation, and associative recall, enabling direct comparison between model behavior and human cognitive patterns. Our empirical results reveal that LLMs demonstrate forgetting rates analogous to human memory efficiency trade-offs between stability and adaptability. Building on these observations, we propose probabilistic memory prompting, a lightweight strategy that shapes evidence integration to mimic human-like memory decay, leading to improved long-horizon reasoning performance. Our findings position forgetting not as a failure mode, but as a principled mechanism for adaptive intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores mechanisms for cross-domain scientific synthesis using graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning and compares this method to language model baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing methods for synthesizing mechanistic explanations across fragmented scientific literature, specifically addressing limitations of retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models.

Method: The study introduces SciNets, a graph-constrained reasoning framework that constructs concept graphs from scientific literature and integrates shortest-path reasoning, diverse paths, stochastic walks, and retrieval-augmented language models.

Result: Graph constraints enhance controllable multi-hop reasoning, balancing reasoning depth, diversity, and grounding stability. Trade-offs include deeper reasoning leading to instability while shortest-path reasoning provides structural conservation.

Conclusion: Explicit graph constraints show promise for scientific synthesis, but they expose the trade-off between reasoning depth/diversity and grounding stability in graph-LLM integration.

Abstract: Cross-domain scientific synthesis requires connecting mechanistic explanations across fragmented literature, a capability that remains challenging for both retrieval-based systems and unconstrained language models. While recent work has applied large language models to scientific summarization and question answering, these approaches provide limited control over reasoning depth and structural grounding. We frame mechanistic synthesis as a graph-constrained multi-hop reasoning problem over literature-derived concept graphs. Given a scientific query and a compact, query-local corpus, SciNets constructs a directed concept graph and synthesizes mechanistic explanations by identifying multi-hop reasoning paths that connect concepts that rarely co-occur within individual papers. We systematically compare shortest-path reasoning, k-shortest paths with diversity constraints, stochastic random walks, and a retrieval-augmented language model baseline. Rather than evaluating correctness, which is often indeterminate when synthesizing connections across distributed sources, we introduce a behavioral framework that measures symbolic reasoning depth, mechanistic diversity, and grounding stability. Across machine learning, biology, and climate science tasks, explicit graph constraints enable controllable multi-hop reasoning while revealing a consistent trade-off: deeper and more diverse symbolic reasoning increases grounding instability, whereas shortest-path reasoning remains highly stable but structurally conservative. These findings provide a systematic behavioral characterization of the limits and capabilities of current graph-LLM integration for scientific synthesis.

### [71] [Eliminating Agentic Workflow for Introduction Generation with Parametric Stage Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09728)
*Meicong Zhang,Tiancheng su,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes STIG, a method to generate robust research introductions using LLMs by embedding logical structures directly in the model, eliminating the need for external workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods to guide LLMs for generating research introductions rely on agentic workflows, which face issues such as long reasoning chains, error accumulation, and reduced textual coherence.

Method: The authors developed STIG, which encodes logical writing stages directly into the LLM using stage tokens. Through instruction tuning, the model associates stage tokens with text functions and learns logical transitions, enabling it to generate complete introductions in one inference.

Result: Experimental results indicate that STIG surpasses traditional workflows and other baselines in semantic similarity and sentence-structural coherence, providing a more streamlined and accurate generation process.

Conclusion: Eliminating external workflows through logical parameterization significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to generate research introductions, proving STIG's effectiveness over traditional methods.

Abstract: In recent years, using predefined agentic workflows to guide large language models (LLMs) for literature classification and review has become a research focus. However, writing research introductions is more challenging. It requires rigorous logic, coherent structure, and abstract summarization. Existing workflows often suffer from long reasoning chains, error accumulation, and reduced textual coherence. To address these limitations, we propose eliminating external agentic workflows. Instead, we directly parameterize their logical structure into the LLM. This allows the generation of a complete introduction in a single inference. To this end, we introduce the Stage Token for Introduction Generation (STIG). STIG converts the multiple stages of the original workflow into explicit stage signals. These signals guide the model to follow different logical roles and functions during generation. Through instruction tuning, the model learns the mapping between stage tokens and text functions. It also learns the logical order and transition patterns between stages, encoding this knowledge into the model parameters. Experimental results show that STIG can generate multi-stage text in a single inference. It does not require explicit workflow calls. STIG outperforms traditional agentic workflows and other baselines on metrics of semantic similarity and sentence-level structural rationality. The code is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

*Tohida Rehman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a summarization framework to efficiently analyze lengthy financial transcripts using hybrid techniques, ensuring concise and factually reliable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of financial earnings call transcripts is labor-intensive and prone to errors.

Method: The study uses a hybrid summarization pipeline combining LexRank (to extract key sentences), fine-tuned BART and PEGASUS (for summarization in constrained settings), and a Longformer Encoder-Decoder model for long-range dependencies.

Result: Long context models demonstrate the best performance overall; the hybrid framework achieves competitive results with better factual consistency under resource constraints.

Conclusion: The findings encourage the creation of practical summarization systems to streamline analysis of financial documents and extract actionable business insights.

Abstract: Financial reports and earnings communications contain large volumes of structured and semi structured information, making detailed manual analysis inefficient. Earnings conference calls provide valuable evidence about a firm's performance, outlook, and strategic priorities. The manual analysis of lengthy call transcripts requires substantial effort and is susceptible to interpretive bias and unintentional error. In this work, we present a hybrid summarization framework that combines extractive and abstractive techniques to produce concise and factually reliable Reuters-style summaries from the ECTSum dataset. The proposed two stage pipeline first applies the LexRank algorithm to identify salient sentences, which are subsequently summarized using fine-tuned variants of BART and PEGASUS designed for resource constrained settings. In parallel, we fine-tune a Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model to directly capture long-range contextual dependencies in financial documents.
  Model performance is evaluated using standard automatic metrics, including ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, and BERTScore, along with domain-specific variants such as SciBERTScore and FinBERTScore. To assess factual accuracy, we further employ entity-level measures based on source-precision and F1-target. The results highlight complementary trade offs between approaches, long context models yield the strongest overall performance, while the hybrid framework achieves competitive results with improved factual consistency under computational constraints. These findings support the development of practical summarization systems for efficiently distilling lengthy financial texts into usable business insights.

### [73] [Clinical Document Metadata Extraction: A Scoping Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09730)
*Kurt Miller,Qiuhao Lu,William Hersh,Kirk Roberts,Steven Bedrick,Andrew Wen,Hongfang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines automated extraction methods for clinical document metadata, highlighting trends, applications, and gaps using a systematic scoping review approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in harmonizing clinical document metadata due to variability across practices and changes over time, and to catalog methods and applications in metadata extraction.

Method: Used PRISMA-ScR guidelines to systematically identify, screen, and review 67 relevant articles on metadata extraction out of an initial 266.

Result: Findings showed progression in methods from rule-based techniques to transformer-based architectures and large language models, enhancing generalizability across tasks.

Conclusion: Research is expected to advance towards richer metadata representations and integration into clinical workflows, leveraging emerging technologies like large language models.

Abstract: Clinical document metadata, such as document type, structure, author role, medical specialty, and encounter setting, is essential for accurate interpretation of information captured in clinical documents. However, vast documentation heterogeneity and drift over time challenge harmonization of document metadata. Automated extraction methods have emerged to coalesce metadata from disparate practices into target schema. This scoping review aims to catalog research on clinical document metadata extraction, identify methodological trends and applications, and highlight gaps. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to identify articles that perform clinical document metadata extraction. We initially found and screened 266 articles published between January 2011 and August 2025, then comprehensively reviewed 67 we deemed relevant to our study. Among the articles included, 45 were methodological, 17 used document metadata as features in a downstream application, and 5 analyzed document metadata composition. We observe myriad purposes for methodological study and application types. Available labelled public data remains sparse except for structural section datasets. Methods for extracting document metadata have progressed from largely rule-based and traditional machine learning with ample feature engineering to transformer-based architectures with minimal feature engineering. The emergence of large language models has enabled broader exploration of generalizability across tasks and datasets, allowing the possibility of advanced clinical text processing systems. We anticipate that research will continue to expand into richer document metadata representations and integrate further into clinical applications and workflows.

### [74] [Geometric Patterns of Meaning: A PHATE Manifold Analysis of Multi-lingual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09731)
*Wen G Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-level framework using the Semanscope tool for analyzing linguistic structures in multilingual embeddings, revealing systemic insights and limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and visualize the semantic geometry in multilingual word embeddings and identify both patterns and limitations in current embedding models.

Method: They developed Semanscope, a visualization tool that applies PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels, investigating diverse linguistic structures and embedding spaces.

Result: PHATE identified systematic patterns, such as distinct geometric signatures across writing systems, clustering in semantic domains, and unique spiral trajectories of Arabic numbers. Model failures to distinguish semantic and structural components were also revealed.

Conclusion: PHATE manifold learning is a valuable tool for studying and validating semantic structures in embedding models, uncovering both strengths and limitations across linguistic and numeric domains.

Abstract: We introduce a multi-level analysis framework for examining semantic geometry in multilingual embeddings, implemented through Semanscope (a visualization tool that applies PHATE manifold learning across four linguistic levels). Analysis of diverse datasets spanning sub-character components, alphabetic systems, semantic domains, and numerical concepts reveals systematic geometric patterns and critical limitations in current embedding models. At the sub-character level, purely structural elements (Chinese radicals) exhibit geometric collapse, highlighting model failures to distinguish semantic from structural components. At the character level, different writing systems show distinct geometric signatures. At the word level, content words form clustering-branching patterns across 20 semantic domains in English, Chinese, and German. Arabic numbers organize through spiral trajectories rather than clustering, violating standard distributional semantics assumptions. These findings establish PHATE manifold learning as an essential analytic tool not only for studying geometric structure of meaning in embedding space, but also for validating the effectiveness of embedding models in capturing semantic relationships.

*Ruochen Li,Kun Yuan,Yufei Xia,Yue Zhou,Qingyu Lu,Weihang Li,Youxiang Zhu,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper establishes a benchmark to critically evaluate vision-language models for surgical planning by highlighting the inadequacy of current metrics and proposing a more reliable rule-based evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to assess and improve VLMs in safety-critical settings, especially in surgical planning where correctness is vital.

Method: Defining planning correctness via expert surgical rules, the paper introduces a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark to distinguish valid and invalid plans and evaluates using a high-precision rule-based metric.

Result: Sequence similarity metrics are shown to be inadequate, while rule-based metrics reveal failures in perception and reasoning. Structural knowledge aids performance, whereas semantic guidance is impactful only in specific scenarios.

Conclusion: A shift to rule-based goal-satisfiability metrics is necessary to reliably evaluate Video-LLMs in critical tasks, emphasizing structural constraints for enhanced accuracy in surgical contexts.

Abstract: Surgical planning integrates visual perception, long-horizon reasoning, and procedural knowledge, yet it remains unclear whether current evaluation protocols reliably assess vision-language models (VLMs) in safety-critical settings. Motivated by a goal-oriented view of surgical planning, we define planning correctness via phase-goal satisfiability, where plan validity is determined by expert-defined surgical rules. Based on this definition, we introduce a multicentric meta-evaluation benchmark with valid procedural variations and invalid plans containing order and content errors. Using this benchmark, we show that sequence similarity metrics systematically misjudge planning quality, penalizing valid plans while failing to identify invalid ones. We therefore adopt a rule-based goal-satisfiability metric as a high-precision meta-evaluation reference to assess Video-LLMs under progressively constrained settings, revealing failures due to perception errors and under-constrained reasoning. Structural knowledge consistently improves performance, whereas semantic guidance alone is unreliable and benefits larger models only when combined with structural constraints.

### [76] [Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Semantic Alignment in Multilingual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09732)
*Wen G. Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates multilingual embedding models for cross-lingual semantic alignment using a new metric (Semantic Affinity) and reveals translation-pair supervision is essential for alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practitioners need guidance on selecting multilingual embedding models with genuine semantic alignment rather than task-focused performance.

Method: Introduced Semantic Affinity (SA) metric and Semanscope framework. Benchmarked 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) to measure alignment.

Result: Top-tier BERT models achieve strong semantic alignment (SA ~0.68-0.70), LLM embeddings plateau at SA ~0.55-0.61, while MLM-only models fail (SA < 0.50).

Conclusion: Semantic alignment requires translation-pair supervision rather than model scale, architecture, or multilingual data alone.

Abstract: With hundreds of multilingual embedding models available, practitioners lack clear guidance on which provide genuine cross-lingual semantic alignment versus task performance through language-specific patterns. Task-driven benchmarks (MTEB) may mask fundamental alignment shortcomings. We introduce Semantic Affinity (SA), a bounded (between 0 and 1) metric measuring inter-lingual to intra-lingual spread ratio using cosine distance, combined with PHATE visualization in our Semanscope framework. Benchmarking 13 models across 4 datasets (52 experiments) reveals a three-tier structure: (1) Top BERT models (LaBSE SA = 0.70, USE SA = 0.68, S-BERT SA = 0.68) achieve strong alignment via translation-pair supervision; (2) LLM embeddings plateau at SA between 0.55 and 0.61 regardless of 0.6 B to 8 B scale; (3) MLM-only BERT models (mBERT, XLM-R, SA < 0.50) fail despite more than 100 language training. Training objective, not architecture or scale, determines alignment. Oracle Bone primitives (1200 BCE) expose semantic drift-models learn corpus patterns rather than cognitive primitives. This work provides semantic benchmarking to help practitioners select quality multilingual embeddings from hundreds of available models, showing cross-lingual alignment requires explicit translation supervision, not merely model scale or multilingual data.

*Xin Gao,Xiaoyang Wang,Yun Zhu,Mengzhang Cai,Conghui He,Lijun Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework called OpenDataArena (ODA) for creating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets for Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing systematic dataset engineering over heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices for constructing SFT datasets rely on heuristics and lack a systematic understanding of how dataset samples contribute to model performance.

Method: Proposes a closed-loop dataset engineering framework using ODA, applying value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to guide dataset construction.

Result: Developed two datasets (ODA-Math-460k and ODA-Mixture) achieving state-of-the-art results in mathematics reasoning and outperforming larger datasets in multi-domain tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ODA framework enhances domain-specific reasoning and general utility, demonstrating the potential of data-centric AI with transparent evaluation to create superior training datasets.

Abstract: The construction of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets is a critical yet under-theorized stage in the post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs), as prevalent practices often rely on heuristic aggregation without a systematic understanding of how individual samples contribute to model performance. In this report, we propose a paradigm shift from ad-hoc curation to a closed-loop dataset engineering framework using OpenDataArena (ODA), which leverages value-anchored rankings and multi-dimensional analysis to transform value benchmarking into feedback signals guiding dataset construction. We instantiate this methodology through two new datasets: \textbf{ODA-Math-460k}, a specialized mathematics reasoning dataset that utilizes a novel two-stage difficulty-aware pipeline to achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on benchmarks such as AIME and HMMT, and \textbf{ODA-Mixture (100k \& 500k)}, a series of multi-domain instruction datasets built via an ``Anchor-and-Patch'' strategy that outperforms significantly larger open-source baselines. Our empirical results demonstrate that ODA-driven datasets significantly improve both domain-specific reasoning and general utility while achieving superior data efficiency, validating a transition toward data-centric AI where transparent evaluation serves as the primary engine for engineering high-quality training data.

### [78] [From Detection to Diagnosis: Advancing Hallucination Analysis with Automated Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09734)
*Yanyi Liu,Qingwen Yang,Tiezheng Guo,Feiyu Qu,Jun Liu,Yingyou Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a shift from detection to diagnosis, introducing the Hallucination Diagnosis Task and an automated data generation pipeline, HDG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs hinder their reliability in critical applications. Current detection approaches do not provide actionable insights for improving models.

Method: The method includes introducing the Hallucination Diagnosis Task, developing the HDG pipeline to generate diagnostic metadata, and training a diagnosis model (HDM-4B-RL) using GRPO optimization techniques.

Result: HDM-4B-RL surpasses state-of-the-art detection models in the HaluEval benchmark and matches the performance of larger models in comprehensive diagnosis tasks while being smaller in size.

Conclusion: This study verifies hallucination diagnosis as a promising approach for improving LLMs and offers methodologies for creating more trustworthy generative AI systems.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), defined as the generation of content inconsistent with facts or context, represent a core obstacle to their reliable deployment in critical domains. Current research primarily focuses on binary "detection" approaches that, while capable of identifying hallucinations, fail to provide interpretable and actionable feedback for model improvement, thus limiting practical utility. To address this limitation, a new research paradigm is proposed, shifting from "detection" to "diagnosis". The Hallucination Diagnosis Task is introduced, a task which requires models to not only detect hallucinations, but also perform error localization, causal explanation, and content correction. We develop the Hallucination Diagnosis Generator (HDG), an automated pipeline that systematically generates high-quality training samples with rich diagnostic metadata from raw corpora through multi-dimensional augmentation strategies including controlled fact fabrication and reasoning chain perturbation. Using HDG-generated data, we train HDM-4B-RL, a 4-billion-parameter hallucination diagnosis model, employing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a comprehensive reward function incorporating structural, accuracy, and localization signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art detection models on the HaluEval benchmark while achieving comparable performance to advanced general-purpose models. In comprehensive diagnosis tasks, HDM-4B-RL matches the capabilities of larger general models while maintaining a smaller size. This work validates the feasibility and value of hallucination diagnosis, providing an effective methodology for building more trustworthy and reliable generative AI systems.

*Xiaoxu Ma,Xiangbo Zhang,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PVNI, an approach for stable and interpretable evaluation of personality traits in LLMs using internal activations and neutral score interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating personality traits in LLMs using questionnaires are unstable and sensitive to variations, leading to limited explainability.

Method: Proposes PVNI, an activation-based method that derives a persona vector from contrastive prompts and interpolates neutral scores along this vector for explainable evaluations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that PVNI offers substantially more stable and reliable personality trait evaluations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PVNI improves stability and interpretability in personality evaluations for LLMs, facilitating better model comparison and responsible deployment.

Abstract: Evaluating personality traits in Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to model interpretation, comparison, and responsible deployment. However, existing questionnaire-based evaluation methods exhibit limited stability and offer little explainability, as their results are highly sensitive to minor variations in prompt phrasing or role-play configurations. To address these limitations, we propose an internal-activation-based approach, termed Persona-Vector Neutrality Interpolation (PVNI), for stable and explainable personality trait evaluation in LLMs. PVNI extracts a persona vector associated with a target personality trait from the model's internal activations using contrastive prompts. It then estimates the corresponding neutral score by interpolating along the persona vector as an anchor axis, enabling an interpretable comparison between the neutral prompt representation and the persona direction. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness and generalization properties of PVNI. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that PVNI yields substantially more stable personality trait evaluations than existing methods, even under questionnaire and role-play variants.

*Sriram Padmanabhan,Siyuan Song,Kanishka Misra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines if vision-language models show human-like inductive reasoning differences when extending novel properties, similar to findings from children in developmental research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether general-purpose statistical learners (like vision-language models) exhibit inductive reasoning differences based on linguistic expressions, paralleling human behavior.

Method: Replicated an experiment involving categorization and reasoning with linguistic expressions ("all," "some," generics) using vision-language models, along with precondition sensitivity tests.

Result: Found behavioral alignment between models and children in representing and reasoning with linguistic structures, with perceptual organization driven by inductive constraints.

Conclusion: Vision-language models mimic human-like inductive constraints in reasoning tasks, demonstrating the potential for advancing cross-disciplinary understanding of cognition and AI systems.

Abstract: Language places subtle constraints on how we make inductive inferences. Developmental evidence by Gelman et al. (2002) has shown children (4 years and older) to differentiate among generic statements ("Bears are daxable"), universally quantified NPs ("all bears are daxable") and indefinite plural NPs ("some bears are daxable") in extending novel properties to a specific member (all > generics > some), suggesting that they represent these types of propositions differently. We test if these subtle differences arise in general purpose statistical learners like Vision Language Models, by replicating the original experiment. On tasking them through a series of precondition tests (robust identification of categories in images and sensitivities to all and some), followed by the original experiment, we find behavioral alignment between models and humans. Post-hoc analyses on their representations revealed that these differences are organized based on inductive constraints and not surface-form differences.

*Sraavya Sambara,Yuan Pu,Ayman Ali,Vishala Mishra,Lionel Wong,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates large language models' (LLMs) ability to respond effectively to real-world health questions with false premises, revealing their limitations in redirecting problematic questions and ensuring safe medical communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether large language models are capable of safely responding to real-world health questions embedding false premises, a crucial competency for patient-facing medical AI systems.

Method: The researchers created a semi-automated pipeline to develop 'MedRedFlag,' a dataset of over 1,100 health-related questions needing redirection, analyzed LLMs' responses, and compared them systematically to clinicians' answers.

Result: LLMs often fail to redirect problematic health questions effectively, even when identifying misleading premises, and provide answers that may lead to suboptimal medical decisions.

Conclusion: LLMs display significant competency gaps in addressing and redirecting flawed health queries, underscoring the need to improve their safety for deployment in medical communication contexts.

Abstract: Real-world health questions from patients often unintentionally embed false assumptions or premises. In such cases, safe medical communication typically involves redirection: addressing the implicit misconception and then responding to the underlying patient context, rather than the original question. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used by lay users for medical advice, they have not yet been tested for this crucial competency. Therefore, in this work, we investigate how LLMs react to false premises embedded within real-world health questions. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to curate MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+ questions sourced from Reddit that require redirection. We then systematically compare responses from state-of-the-art LLMs to those from clinicians. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often fail to redirect problematic questions, even when the problematic premise is detected, and provide answers that could lead to suboptimal medical decision making. Our benchmark and results reveal a novel and substantial gap in how LLMs perform under the conditions of real-world health communication, highlighting critical safety concerns for patient-facing medical AI systems.

*Yilin Bao,Ziyao He,Zayden Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of improving scientific paper generation by proposing a reinforcement learning framework to enhance document planning, coherence, and citation accuracy. Results indicate better performance compared to baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency when generating scientific papers, despite good local fluency.

Method: The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach that treats scientific outline creation as a long-horizon planning problem. It leverages a two-stage optimization process involving backward outline reconstruction and forward value-guided learning to improve structure and correctness.

Result: The method demonstrates consistent improvements over baseline models in terms of structural coherence and citation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework represents an effective approach for improving document-level planning and factual grounding in scientific paper generation, addressing the limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Scientific paper generation requires document-level planning and factual grounding, but current large language models, despite their strong local fluency, often fail in global structure, input coverage, and citation consistency. We present a reinforcement learning framework that casts scientific outline construction as a long-horizon planning problem over hierarchical document structures. Our approach models edit evolving outlines through structured actions, enabling the system to incrementally build a complete scientific manuscript. To support effective and stabilize learning,we introduce a two-stage optimization procedure consisting of (i) backward outline reconstruction from partial plans to enforce global structural consistency, and (ii) forward value-guided reinforcement learning with rewards explicitly modeling scientific correctness, discourse coherence, and citation fidelity. In addition, We further introduce a benchmark for scientific paper generation that evaluates document planning, input utilization, reference faithfulness, outline organization, and content-level factual accuracy. Our results show consistent improvements over strong neural and LLM baselines, particularly in long-range structural coherence and citation reliability.

*Yifei Shen,Yilun Zhao,Justice Ou,Tinglin Huang,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLINSQL, a challenging benchmark for text-to-SQL tasks in clinical settings, particularly focusing on heterogeneous, temporal, and patient-similarity aspects, using MIMIC-IV data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to address the gaps in current text-to-SQL systems for real-world clinical applications that involve complex reasoning over electronic health records (EHRs) such as multi-table joins, temporal data, and patient similarity queries.

Method: The authors propose CLINSQL, a benchmark composed of 633 annotated tasks, alongside an evaluation framework using Chain-of-Thought and SQL analysis checks to test the ability of models to perform accurate query generation.

Result: Their evaluation shows limited performance of current models with GPT-5-mini scoring 74.7%, DeepSeek-R1 at 69.2% for open-source, and Gemini-2.5-Pro dropping significantly on harder tasks, revealing room for improvement.

Conclusion: While models have made progress on CLINSQL, they currently lack the reliability needed for real-world clinical tasks, marking opportunities for future development in this challenging domain.

Abstract: Real-world clinical text-to-SQL requires reasoning over heterogeneous EHR tables, temporal windows, and patient-similarity cohorts to produce executable queries. We introduce CLINSQL, a benchmark of 633 expert-annotated tasks on MIMIC-IV v3.1 that demands multi-table joins, clinically meaningful filters, and executable SQL. Solving CLINSQL entails navigating schema metadata and clinical coding systems, handling long contexts, and composing multi-step queries beyond traditional text-to-SQL. We evaluate 22 proprietary and open-source models under Chain-of-Thought self-refinement and use rubric-based SQL analysis with execution checks that prioritize critical clinical requirements. Despite recent advances, performance remains far from clinical reliability: on the test set, GPT-5-mini attains 74.7% execution score, DeepSeek-R1 leads open-source at 69.2% and Gemini-2.5-Pro drops from 85.5% on Easy to 67.2% on Hard. Progress on CLINSQL marks tangible advances toward clinically reliable text-to-SQL for real-world EHR analytics.

*Sathvik Nair,Byung-Doh Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares human cloze task responses and language model (LM) probabilities for predicting word processing effort, demonstrating LMs perform better and analyzing why.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether language model (LM) probabilities outperform cloze data for predicting processing effort provides insight into language comprehension and the advantages of LM-based measures.

Method: The authors investigate hypotheses explaining LM advantages: resolution issues in cloze studies, distinction between semantically similar words, and probabilities assigned to rare words.

Result: The findings highlight key advantages of LMs over cloze tasks, emphasizing the need for improving cloze study resolution and further exploring human prediction sensitivity.

Conclusion: LM probabilities outperform cloze data due to better resolution and nuanced word distinction, validating their scientific value for studying prediction in language processing.

Abstract: How predictable a word is can be quantified in two ways: using human responses to the cloze task or using probabilities from language models (LMs).When used as predictors of processing effort, LM probabilities outperform probabilities derived from cloze data. However, it is important to establish that LM probabilities do so for the right reasons, since different predictors can lead to different scientific conclusions about the role of prediction in language comprehension. We present evidence for three hypotheses about the advantage of LM probabilities: not suffering from low resolution, distinguishing semantically similar words, and accurately assigning probabilities to low-frequency words. These results call for efforts to improve the resolution of cloze studies, coupled with experiments on whether human-like prediction is also as sensitive to the fine-grained distinctions made by LM probabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates using open-source large language models (LLMs) to estimate the difficulty of math test items, showing significant correlations between simulation-based predictions and real-world difficulty statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore cost-effective and scalable alternatives to expensive human pilot studies for determining the difficulty of standardized math test items.

Method: The paper uses simulation-based methods where LLMs role-play as students in a 'classroom,' assigning varying proficiency levels to these simulated students. Item Response Theory (IRT) models are used to analyze the simulated outcomes and compare them with real-world difficulty data.

Result: The study achieves high correlation scores (up to 0.82) between simulated predictions and real-world difficulty levels for different grades (4, 8, and 12). Role-playing with named and demographically diverse 'students' further enhanced prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, even those with weaker math abilities, can effectively predict math question difficulties, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Standardized math assessments require expensive human pilot studies to establish the difficulty of test items. We investigate the predictive value of open-source large language models (LLMs) for evaluating the difficulty of multiple-choice math questions for real-world students. We show that, while LLMs are poor direct judges of problem difficulty, simulation-based approaches with LLMs yield promising results under the right conditions. Under the proposed approach, we simulate a "classroom" of 4th, 8th, or 12th grade students by prompting the LLM to role-play students of varying proficiency levels. We use the outcomes of these simulations to fit Item Response Theory (IRT) models, comparing learned difficulty parameters for items to their real-world difficulties, as determined by item-level statistics furnished by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). We observe correlations as high as 0.75, 0.76, and 0.82 for grades 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In our simulations, we experiment with different "classroom sizes," showing tradeoffs between computation size and accuracy. We find that role-plays with named students improves predictions (compared to student ids), and stratifying names across gender and race further improves predictions. Our results show that LLMs with relatively weaker mathematical abilities (Gemma) actually yield better real-world difficulty predictions than mathematically stronger models (Llama and Qwen), further underscoring the suitability of open-source models for the task.

*David Samuel Setiawan,Raphaël Merx,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses performance issues faced by Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models in low-resource settings during domain shifts, using the Dhao language as an example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to tackle the degradation of translation quality when NMT models experience domain shifts, a common challenge for low-resource languages.

Method: A hybrid framework is proposed where an NMT model drafts translations, refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Result: The hybrid system significantly improves translation quality in the unseen domain, recovering 8.10 chrF++, achieving near in-domain performance.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of the approach relies on the use of retrieved examples rather than retrieval algorithms, with the LLM successfully addressing major translation failures.

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for low-resource languages suffer significant performance degradation under domain shift. We quantify this challenge using Dhao, an indigenous language of Eastern Indonesia with no digital footprint beyond the New Testament (NT). When applied to the unseen Old Testament (OT), a standard NMT model fine-tuned on the NT drops from an in-domain score of 36.17 chrF++ to 27.11 chrF++. To recover this loss, we introduce a hybrid framework where a fine-tuned NMT model generates an initial draft, which is then refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The final system achieves 35.21 chrF++ (+8.10 recovery), effectively matching the original in-domain quality. Our analysis reveals that this performance is driven primarily by the number of retrieved examples rather than the choice of retrieval algorithm. Qualitative analysis confirms the LLM acts as a robust "safety net," repairing severe failures in zero-shot domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocraticKG offers an innovative method to solve trade-offs in LLM-based Knowledge Graph construction by using QA pairs as intermediate representations, improving factual retention and structural cohesion in graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM methods in KG construction face trade-offs between factual coverage (resulting in fragmentation) and premature consolidation (leading to loss of information).

Method: SocraticKG utilizes question-answer pairs as intermediate representations guided by 5W1H expansion to capture document-level semantics and relational links before extracting triples.

Result: Evaluation on the MINE benchmark shows SocraticKG enhances factual retention and structural cohesion while addressing the coverage-connectivity trade-off.

Conclusion: QA-mediated semantic scaffolding is crucial for structuring knowledge before KG extraction, improving coherence and reliability in constructed graphs.

Abstract: Constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) from unstructured text provides a structured framework for knowledge representation and reasoning, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with a fundamental trade-off: factual coverage often leads to relational fragmentation, while premature consolidation causes information loss. To address this, we propose SocraticKG, an automated KG construction method that introduces question-answer pairs as a structured intermediate representation to systematically unfold document-level semantics prior to triple extraction. By employing 5W1H-guided QA expansion, SocraticKG captures contextual dependencies and implicit relational links typically lost in direct KG extraction pipelines, providing explicit grounding in the source document that helps mitigate implicit reasoning errors. Evaluation on the MINE benchmark demonstrates that our approach effectively addresses the coverage-connectivity trade-off, achieving superior factual retention while maintaining high structural cohesion even as extracted knowledge volume substantially expands. These results highlight that QA-mediated semantic scaffolding plays a critical role in structuring semantics prior to KG extraction, enabling more coherent and reliable graph construction in subsequent stages.

TL;DR: EHRNavigator is a multi-agent framework designed for patient-level question answering in Electronic Health Records, showing strong generalization with 86% accuracy and clinically acceptable response times in real-world hospital settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, natural language question-answering systems often fail to address practical scenarios in clinical decision-making due to reliance on benchmark datasets rather than real-world applications.

Method: The study introduces EHRNavigator, a framework utilizing AI agents to analyze and answer patient-level questions across heterogeneous, multimodal EHR data under realistic hospital conditions.

Result: EHRNavigator achieved 86% accuracy on real-world cases, with strong generalization and response times validated as clinically acceptable through quantitative evaluation and clinician chart review.

Conclusion: EHRNavigator successfully bridges the gap between theoretical evaluation and clinical application, providing an adaptive and efficient QA solution for EHRs in real-world healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making increasingly relies on timely and context-aware access to patient information within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), yet most existing natural language question-answering (QA) systems are evaluated solely on benchmark datasets, limiting their practical relevance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce EHRNavigator, a multi-agent framework that harnesses AI agents to perform patient-level question answering across heterogeneous and multimodal EHR data. We assessed its performance using both public benchmark and institutional datasets under realistic hospital conditions characterized by diverse schemas, temporal reasoning demands, and multimodal evidence integration. Through quantitative evaluation and clinician-validated chart review, EHRNavigator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving 86% accuracy on real-world cases while maintaining clinically acceptable response times. Overall, these findings confirm that EHRNavigator effectively bridges the gap between benchmark evaluation and clinical deployment, offering a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution for real-world EHR question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmplifAI is a new Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset tailored for patients with chronic medical conditions, featuring emotion-specific situations and dialogues. It improves empathy and fluency in language models when fine-tuned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop methods to support patients dealing with chronic conditions by helping address their complex emotional needs in dialogue interactions.

Method: The dataset involves crowdsourced and expert-reviewed dialogues grounded in 28 emotion categories adapted from GoEmotions. Evaluations of emotional alignment were performed using BERTScore across various LLMs, followed by fine-tuning a Japanese LLM.

Result: EmplifAI contains 280 situations and 4125 dialogues. Fine-tuned LLM showed improved fluency, empathy (general and emotion-specific). Validation through human and LLM judge correlation analysis was conducted.

Conclusion: EmplifAI is effective for enhancing emotional alignment, fluency, and empathetic communication in LLMs for medical support, with useful insights about risks in evaluation.

Abstract: This paper introduces EmplifAI, a Japanese empathetic dialogue dataset designed to support patients coping with chronic medical conditions. They often experience a wide range of positive and negative emotions (e.g., hope and despair) that shift across different stages of disease management. EmplifAI addresses this complexity by providing situation-based dialogues grounded in 28 fine-grained emotion categories, adapted and validated from the GoEmotions taxonomy. The dataset includes 280 medically contextualized situations and 4125 two-turn dialogues, collected through crowdsourcing and expert review. To evaluate emotional alignment in empathetic dialogues, we assessed model predictions on situation--dialogue pairs using BERTScore across multiple large language models (LLMs), achieving F1 scores of 0.83. Fine-tuning a baseline Japanese LLM (LLM-jp-3.1-13b-instruct4) with EmplifAI resulted in notable improvements in fluency, general empathy, and emotion-specific empathy. Furthermore, we compared the scores assigned by LLM-as-a-Judge and human raters on dialogues generated by multiple LLMs to validate our evaluation pipeline and discuss the insights and potential risks derived from the correlation analysis.

### [90] [Long-Chain Reasoning Distillation via Adaptive Prefix Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10064)
*Zhenghao Liu,Zhuoyang Wu,Xinze Li,Yukun Yan,Shuo Wang,Zulong Chen,Yu Gu,Ge Yu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces P-ALIGN, a distillation framework that improves reasoning abilities in student models by optimizing teacher-generated reasoning trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a mismatch between teacher-generated long, complex reasoning trajectories and the learning capacity of student models, limiting the efficacy of distillation techniques.

Method: The proposed P-ALIGN framework adaptively truncates teacher reasoning trajectories based on their sufficiency, focusing on supervising student models with effective prefixes while avoiding redundant components.

Result: P-ALIGN shows over 3% performance improvement across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive prefix alignment can effectively streamline the distillation process, yielding better supervision signals and avoiding negative impacts of complex reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in solving complex mathematical problems. Recent studies show that distilling long reasoning trajectories can effectively enhance the reasoning performance of small-scale student models. However, teacher-generated reasoning trajectories are often excessively long and structurally complex, making them difficult for student models to learn. This mismatch leads to a gap between the provided supervision signal and the learning capacity of the student model. To address this challenge, we propose Prefix-ALIGNment distillation (P-ALIGN), a framework that fully exploits teacher CoTs for distillation through adaptive prefix alignment. Specifically, P-ALIGN adaptively truncates teacher-generated reasoning trajectories by determining whether the remaining suffix is concise and sufficient to guide the student model. Then, P-ALIGN leverages the teacher-generated prefix to supervise the student model, encouraging effective prefix alignment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that P-ALIGN outperforms all baselines by over 3%. Further analysis indicates that the prefixes constructed by P-ALIGN provide more effective supervision signals, while avoiding the negative impact of redundant and uncertain reasoning components.

### [91] [Deriving Character Logic from Storyline as Codified Decision Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10080)
*Letian Peng,Kun Zhou,Longfei Yun,Yupeng Hou,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven, executable, and interpretable framework for creating more reliable role-playing agents by leveraging large-scale narrative data to build behavioral profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing role-playing agent behavioral profiles are inconsistent and weakly validated, leading to unreliable agent actions in diverse contexts.

Method: A framework called Codified Decision Trees (CDT) is proposed that builds behavioral profiles as a tree of rules. It iteratively learns these rules from data, validates them, and refines the tree for better reliability and interpretability.

Result: CDT outperformed human-written profiles and previous induction methods across benchmarks, demonstrating improved consistency and agent grounding for 85 characters in 16 distinct narrative contexts.

Conclusion: Codified and validated behavioral profiles using CDT lead to more consistent and grounded role-playing agents, offering a systematic approach to profile creation and refinement.

Abstract: Role-playing (RP) agents rely on behavioral profiles to act consistently across diverse narrative contexts, yet existing profiles are largely unstructured, non-executable, and weakly validated, leading to brittle agent behavior. We propose Codified Decision Trees (CDT), a data-driven framework that induces an executable and interpretable decision structure from large-scale narrative data. CDT represents behavioral profiles as a tree of conditional rules, where internal nodes correspond to validated scene conditions and leaves encode grounded behavioral statements, enabling deterministic retrieval of context-appropriate rules at execution time. The tree is learned by iteratively inducing candidate scene-action rules, validating them against data, and refining them through hierarchical specialization, yielding profiles that support transparent inspection and principled updates. Across multiple benchmarks, CDT substantially outperforms human-written profiles and prior profile induction methods on $85$ characters across $16$ artifacts, indicating that codified and validated behavioral representations lead to more reliable agent grounding.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of commercial machine translation systems in translating crisis-related and medical domain texts for low-resource languages using the TICO-19 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is often a mismatch in communication during crises between governments, aid providers, and affected communities due to language barriers. Machine Translation systems are potential tools to address this issue.

Method: The study evaluates four commercial MT systems for their effectiveness in translating pandemic-related texts using the TICO-19 dataset, comprising sentences in high-priority low-resource languages.

Result: The usability of output translations by MT systems is assessed to determine preparedness for another pandemic or epidemic.

Conclusion: Commercial MT systems are a viable tool but their effectiveness for low-resource languages in crisis situations needs evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Communication in times of crisis is essential. However, there is often a mismatch between the language of governments, aid providers, doctors, and those to whom they are providing aid. Commercial MT systems are reasonable tools to turn to in these scenarios. But how effective are these tools for translating to and from low resource languages, particularly in the crisis or medical domain? In this study, we evaluate four commercial MT systems using the TICO-19 dataset, which is composed of pandemic-related sentences from a large set of high priority languages spoken by communities most likely to be affected adversely in the next pandemic. We then assess the current degree of ``readiness'' for another pandemic (or epidemic) based on the usability of the output translations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM-IT introduces a framework to improve the performance of LLMs in mental health dialogues by modeling dual-actor conversational dynamics, addressing long-horizon drift and improving therapeutic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the ability of LLMs to sustain realistic and goal-driven dialogue for extended durations in therapeutic settings, focusing on overcoming brittleness and long-horizon drift.

Method: CALM-IT models therapist-client interactions as a bidirectional state-space process, continuously updating inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to generate realistic MI dialogues.

Result: CALM-IT outperformed strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment, maintained stability in long conversations, and achieved the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), demonstrating precise intervention strategies.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling evolving conversational states is vital for generating high-quality, long-form synthetic dialogues in therapeutic contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health-related settings, yet they struggle to sustain realistic, goal-directed dialogue over extended interactions. While LLMs generate fluent responses, they optimize locally for the next turn rather than maintaining a coherent model of therapeutic progress, leading to brittleness and long-horizon drift. We introduce CALM-IT, a framework for generating and evaluating long-form Motivational Interviewing (MI) dialogues that explicitly models dual-actor conversational dynamics. CALM-IT represents therapist-client interaction as a bidirectional state-space process, in which both agents continuously update inferred alignment, mental states, and short-term goals to guide strategy selection and utterance generation. Across large-scale evaluations, CALM-IT consistently outperforms strong baselines in Effectiveness and Goal Alignment and remains substantially more stable as conversation length increases. Although CALM-IT initiates fewer therapist redirections, it achieves the highest client acceptance rate (64.3%), indicating more precise and therapeutically aligned intervention timing. Overall, CALM-IT provides evidence for modeling evolving conversational state being essential for generating high-quality long-form synthetic conversations.

*Yiming Ren,Junjie Wang,Yuxin Meng,Yihang Shi,Zhiqiang Lin,Ruihang Chu,Yiran Xu,Ziming Li,Yunfei Zhao,Zihan Wang,Yu Qiao,Ruiming Tang,Minghao Liu,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in assessing multimodal language models' comprehension of scientific documents by introducing a new paradigm, "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO), which emphasizes evidence-linked reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating multimodal language models often relies on metrics that reward answer-matching without ensuring causal reasoning tied to evidence, highlighting the need for a better framework.

Method: The paper introduces SIN-Data, a corpus preserving text-figure interleaving, and SIN-Bench, consisting of progressive tasks (evidence discovery, hypothesis verification, grounded QA, synthesis). Additionally, a scoring method, "No Evidence, No Score," evaluates grounded predictions based on anchors.

Result: Among eight multimodal language models evaluated, Gemini-3-pro achieved the highest overall score for evidence-aligned tasks, whereas GPT-5 excelled at QA accuracy but struggled with evidence-grounding tasks.

Conclusion: Grounding evidence remains the main bottleneck for state-of-the-art models, indicating that advancing evidence-linked reasoning is critical for improved scientific document comprehension.

Abstract: Evaluating whether multimodal large language models truly understand long-form scientific papers remains challenging: answer-only metrics and synthetic "Needle-In-A-Haystack" tests often reward answer matching without requiring a causal, evidence-linked reasoning trace in the document. We propose the "Fish-in-the-Ocean" (FITO) paradigm, which requires models to construct explicit cross-modal evidence chains within native scientific documents. To operationalize FITO, we build SIN-Data, a scientific interleaved corpus that preserves the native interleaving of text and figures. On top of it, we construct SIN-Bench with four progressive tasks covering evidence discovery (SIN-Find), hypothesis verification (SIN-Verify), grounded QA (SIN-QA), and evidence-anchored synthesis (SIN-Summary). We further introduce "No Evidence, No Score", scoring predictions when grounded to verifiable anchors and diagnosing evidence quality via matching, relevance, and logic. Experiments on eight MLLMs show that grounding is the primary bottleneck: Gemini-3-pro achieves the best average overall score (0.573), while GPT-5 attains the highest SIN-QA answer accuracy (0.767) but underperforms on evidence-aligned overall scores, exposing a gap between correctness and traceable support.

*Lechen Zhang,Yunxiang Zhang,Wei Hu,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a skill-centric framework for distilling reasoning models efficiently, showcasing performance gains with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of large-scale data requirements in supervised fine-tuning when distilling reasoning models.

Method: The proposed framework involves (1) skill-based data selection focusing on weaker skills of the student model and (2) skill-aware fine-tuning to decompose skills explicitly during reasoning.

Result: With just 1,000 training examples, the method achieves notable improvements in reasoning accuracy (+1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B) compared to random supervised fine-tuning using 100K examples.

Conclusion: Skill-centric training effectively enhances reasoning ability with reduced data, emphasizing efficiency in model distillation.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 and their distilled variants achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, distilling these models often demands large-scale data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), motivating the pursuit of data-efficient training methods. To address this, we propose a skill-centric distillation framework that efficiently transfers reasoning ability to weaker models with two components: (1) Skill-based data selection, which prioritizes examples targeting the student model's weaker skills, and (2) Skill-aware fine-tuning, which encourages explicit skill decomposition during problem solving. With only 1,000 training examples selected from a 100K teacher-generated corpus, our method surpasses random SFT baselines by +1.6% on Qwen3-4B and +1.4% on Qwen3-8B across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Further analysis confirms that these gains concentrate on skills emphasized during training, highlighting the effectiveness of skill-centric training for efficient reasoning distillation.

At the data level, the paper further analyzes the methods and challenges of constructing role-specific corpora, focusing on data sources, copyright constraints, and structured annotation processes. In terms of evaluation, it collates multi-dimensional assessment frameworks and benchmark datasets covering role knowledge, personality fidelity, value alignment, and interactive hallucination, while commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of methods such as human evaluation, reward models, and LLM-based scoring. Finally, the paper outlines future development directions of role-playing agents, including personality evolution modeling, multi-agent collaborative narrative, multimodal immersive interaction, and integration with cognitive neuroscience, aiming to provide a systematic perspective and methodological insights for subsequent research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces TS-Bench for evaluating tool invocation safety in LLM-based agents and proposes TS-Guard and TS-Flow frameworks to prevent unsafe executions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the amplified security risks in LLM-based agent environments by monitoring unsafe tool invocation actions in real-time.

Method: Developing TS-Bench benchmark for safety detection, TS-Guard guardrail model using multi-task reinforcement learning, and TS-Flow feedback-driven framework to enhance reasoning safety.

Result: TS-Flow reduces harmful tool invocation by 65 percent and improves benign task completion by 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.

Conclusion: Introducing guardrail models like TS-Guard and frameworks like TS-Flow can significantly enhance the safe deployment of LLM-based agents interacting with tools.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents can interact with environments via invoking external tools, their expanded capabilities also amplify security risks. Monitoring step-level tool invocation behaviors in real time and proactively intervening before unsafe execution is critical for agent deployment, yet remains under-explored. In this work, we first construct TS-Bench, a novel benchmark for step-level tool invocation safety detection in LLM agents. We then develop a guardrail model, TS-Guard, using multi-task reinforcement learning. The model proactively detects unsafe tool invocation actions before execution by reasoning over the interaction history. It assesses request harmfulness and action-attack correlations, producing interpretable and generalizable safety judgments and feedback. Furthermore, we introduce TS-Flow, a guardrail-feedback-driven reasoning framework for LLM agents, which reduces harmful tool invocations of ReAct-style agents by 65 percent on average and improves benign task completion by approximately 10 percent under prompt injection attacks.

*Guimin Hu,Meng Li,Qiwei Peng,Lijie Hu,Boyan Xu,Ruichu Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the behavior of Mixture of Experts (MoE) large language models' (LLMs) experts and their activation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs, which has been less explored compared to layer- or neuron-level interpretability, inspired by functional specialization in the human brain.

Method: The paper develops entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to identify and study activation patterns of domain and driver experts in MoE models across three public domains.

Result: The findings show that some experts have domain preferences, others significantly affect model output (driver experts), specific tokens influence expert activation, and adjusting expert weights improves performance.

Conclusion: The study highlights the internal mechanisms of MoE models, contributing to their interpretability and offering insights for optimizing their performance.

Abstract: Most interpretability work focuses on layer- or neuron-level mechanisms in Transformers, leaving expert-level behavior in MoE LLMs underexplored. Motivated by functional specialization in the human brain, we analyze expert activation by distinguishing domain and driver experts. In this work, we study expert activation in MoE models across three public domains and address two key questions: (1) which experts are activated, and whether certain expert types exhibit consistent activation patterns; and (2) how tokens are associated with and trigger the activation of specific experts. To answer these questions, we introduce entropy-based and causal-effect metrics to assess whether an expert is strongly favored for a particular domain, and how strongly expert activation contributes causally to the model's output, thus identify domain and driver experts, respectively. Furthermore, we explore how individual tokens are associated with the activation of specific experts. Our analysis reveals that (1) Among the activated experts, some show clear domain preferences, while others exert strong causal influence on model performance, underscoring their decisive roles. (2) tokens occurring earlier in a sentence are more likely to trigger the driver experts, and (3) adjusting the weights of domain and driver experts leads to significant performance gains across all three models and domains. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MoE models and enhance their interpretability.

*Cameron Tice,Puria Radmard,Samuel Ratnam,Andy Kim,David Africa,Kyle O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how pretraining corpus content about AI shapes large language models (LLMs) alignment and finds such data significantly affects alignment scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether and how discourse about AI systems in pretraining corpora influences the behavior and alignment of LLMs.

Method: Conducted a controlled study by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying proportions of alignment and misalignment discourse, observing changes in misalignment scores.

Result: Upsampling documents about AI misalignment increased misaligned behavior, while emphasizing aligned behavior drastically reduced misalignment scores (from 45% to 9%). The effects persisted, albeit less strongly, post-training.

Conclusion: Pretraining corpora data directly shapes LLMs' alignment, highlighting the importance of alignment pretraining alongside post-training. Recommends practitioners emphasize alignment in pretraining. Models and datasets are publicly available at alignmentpretraining.ai.

Abstract: Pretraining corpora contain extensive discourse about AI systems, yet the causal influence of this discourse on downstream alignment remains poorly understood. If prevailing descriptions of AI behaviour are predominantly negative, LLMs may internalise corresponding behavioural priors, giving rise to self-fulfilling misalignment. This paper provides the first controlled study of this hypothesis by pretraining 6.9B-parameter LLMs with varying amounts of (mis)alignment discourse. We find that discussion of AI contributes to misalignment. Upsampling synthetic training documents about AI misalignment leads to a notable increase in misaligned behaviour. Conversely, upsampling documents about aligned behaviour reduces misalignment scores from 45% to 9%. We consider this evidence of self-fulfilling alignment. These effects are dampened, but persist through post-training. Our findings establish the study of how pretraining data shapes alignment priors, or alignment pretraining, as a complement to post-training. We recommend practitioners pretrain for alignment as well as capabilities. Our models and datasets are available at alignmentpretraining.ai

Result: Credit C-GPT shows consistent improvements over traditional pipeline-based methods when evaluated on proprietary annotated datasets.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized conversational AI models like Credit C-GPT offer scalable, privacy-conscious solutions for real-time and post-call analytics in enterprise environments.

Abstract: Debt collection is a critical function within the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, relying heavily on large-scale human-to-human conversational interactions conducted primarily in Vietnamese contact centers. These conversations involve informal spoken language, emotional variability, and complex domain-specific reasoning, which pose significant challenges for traditional natural language processing systems. This paper introduces Credit C-GPT, a domain-specialized large language model with seven billion parameters, fine-tuned for conversational understanding in Vietnamese debt collection scenarios. The proposed model integrates multiple conversational intelligence tasks, including dialogue understanding, sentiment recognition, intent detection, call stage classification, and structured slot-value extraction, within a single reasoning-based framework. We describe the data construction process, annotation strategy, and training methodology, and evaluate the model on proprietary human-annotated datasets. Experimental results show consistent improvements over traditional pipeline-based approaches, indicating that domain-specialized conversational language models provide a scalable and privacy-aware solution for real-time assistance and post-call analytics in enterprise contact centers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark (Sand-Glass) and a reinforcement learning framework (HOMURA) to tackle verbosity bias in large language models for strict-duration multilingual translation tasks, achieving improved length control and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models fail to perform well in tasks requiring strict cross-lingual temporal constraints, like dubbing or subtitling, due to verbosity bias conflicting with temporal requirements.

Method: The authors designed Sand-Glass benchmark for syllable-level duration evaluation and HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that balances semantic preservation with length control using KL-regularized objectives and dynamic syllable-ratio rewards.

Result: Experimental results show HOMURA surpassing strong LLM baselines in achieving precise output length control while maintaining semantic adequacy across languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark address the trade-off between multilingual semantic fidelity and syllable-based duration constraints, meeting practical needs in applications requiring strict temporal alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable strides in multilingual translation but are hindered by a systemic cross-lingual verbosity bias, rendering them unsuitable for strict time-constrained tasks like subtitling and dubbing. Current prompt-engineering approaches struggle to resolve this conflict between semantic fidelity and rigid temporal feasibility. To bridge this gap, we first introduce Sand-Glass, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate translation under syllable-level duration constraints. Furthermore, we propose HOMURA, a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly optimizes the trade-off between semantic preservation and temporal compliance. By employing a KL-regularized objective with a novel dynamic syllable-ratio reward, HOMURA effectively "tames" the output length. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines, achieving precise length control that respects linguistic density hierarchies without compromising semantic adequacy.

Result: HUMANLLM achieves a high human alignment score (r=0.91). The HUMANLLM-8B model outperformed a larger Qwen3-32B model on multi-pattern dynamics despite having fewer parameters.

Conclusion: True anthropomorphism in language agents requires modeling the psychological processes behind human behavior, showcasing that the complexity of human-like interaction lies in cognitive simulations rather than solely increasing model parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning and generation, serving as the foundation for advanced persona simulation and Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs). However, achieving authentic alignment with human cognitive and behavioral patterns remains a critical challenge for these agents. We present HUMANLLM, a framework treating psychological patterns as interacting causal forces. We construct 244 patterns from ~12,000 academic papers and synthesize 11,359 scenarios where 2-5 patterns reinforce, conflict, or modulate each other, with multi-turn conversations expressing inner thoughts, actions, and dialogue. Our dual-level checklists evaluate both individual pattern fidelity and emergent multi-pattern dynamics, achieving strong human alignment (r=0.91) while revealing that holistic metrics conflate simulation accuracy with social desirability. HUMANLLM-8B outperforms Qwen3-32B on multi-pattern dynamics despite 4x fewer parameters, demonstrating that authentic anthropomorphism requires cognitive modeling--simulating not just what humans do, but the psychological processes generating those behaviors.

### [104] [One Instruction Does Not Fit All: How Well Do Embeddings Align Personas and Instructions in Low-Resource Indian Languages?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10205)
*Arya Shah,Himanshu beniwal,Mayank Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating multilingual assistants' ability to align with culturally specific user preferences across 12 Indian languages, using persona-to-instruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of a standardized framework to evaluate multilingual embedding models for persona-instruction alignment, especially for India's diverse linguistic and script landscape.

Method: Proposes a unified benchmark with four evaluation tasks and tests eight embedding models in a frozen-encoder setup using logistic regression for specific metrics: Recall@1 and AUROC.

Result: E5-Large-Instruct achieved the best monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval results, BGE-M3 excelled at reverse retrieval, and LaBSE showed strong classification performance with a 75.3% AUROC.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical guide for selecting multilingual models in Indic retrieval tasks and introduces reproducible baselines for future research.

Abstract: Aligning multilingual assistants with culturally grounded user preferences is essential for serving India's linguistically diverse population of over one billion speakers across multiple scripts. However, existing benchmarks either focus on a single language or conflate retrieval with generation, leaving open the question of whether current embedding models can encode persona-instruction compatibility without relying on response synthesis. We present a unified benchmark spanning 12 Indian languages and four evaluation tasks: monolingual and cross-lingual persona-to-instruction retrieval, reverse retrieval from instruction to persona, and binary compatibility classification. Eight multilingual embedding models are evaluated in a frozen-encoder setting with a thin logistic regression head for classification. E5-Large-Instruct achieves the highest Recall@1 of 27.4\% on monolingual retrieval and 20.7\% on cross-lingual transfer, while BGE-M3 leads reverse retrieval at 32.1\% Recall@1. For classification, LaBSE attains 75.3\% AUROC with strong calibration. These findings offer practical guidance for model selection in Indic multilingual retrieval and establish reproducible baselines for future work\footnote{Code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/aryashah2k/PI-Indic-Align.

*Kentaro Kazama,Daiki Shirafuji,Tatsuhiko Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeoSteer introduces a manifold-based framework improving Large Language Models' multi-step reasoning by steering towards high-quality CoT reasoning in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit logically inconsistent reasoning, even with correct final answers, reducing reliability of intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: GeoSteer uses a Variational Autoencoder and quality estimation model to guide hidden states of LLMs towards high-quality CoT reasoning in latent space.

Result: GeoSteer enhanced reasoning performance with an exact match accuracy improvement by 2.6 points and a pairwise win rate increase by 5.3 points on GSM8k.

Conclusion: The framework is effective and provides control in improving intermediate reasoning quality in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved multi-step reasoning. Most approaches rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Previous studies have shown that LLMs often generate logically inconsistent reasoning steps even when their final answers are correct. These inconsistencies reduce the reliability of step-level reasoning. We propose GeoSteer, a manifold-based framework that improves the quality of intermediate reasoning. The method consists of: (1) constructing a CoT dataset with segment-level scores, (2) training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model and a quality estimation model to learn a low-dimensional manifold of high-quality CoT trajectories, and (3) steering hidden states of target LLMs toward higher-quality regions in the latent space. This update in a latent space behaves like a natural-gradient adjustment in the original hidden-state space. It ensures geometrically coherent steering. We evaluate GeoSteer on the GSM8k dataset using the Qwen3 series. We measure via answer accuracy and overall reasoning performance. GeoSteer improved the exact match accuracy by up to 2.6 points. It also enhanced the pairwise win rate by 5.3 points. These results indicate that GeoSteer provides an effective and controllable mechanism for improving the quality of intermediate reasoning in LLMs.

*Guanxu Chen,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether Looped Transformers (LTs) can bridge the gap between internal knowledge and linguistic outputs in LLMs. Findings indicate partial success but highlight limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore if Looped Transformers can improve introspection in language models to better align internal representation space with linguistic outputs.

Method: Empirical experiments evaluate LTs with varying loop iterations to assess introspection and computational depth.

Result: Increasing loop iterations narrows the gap but partially results in degraded internal knowledge. Additionally, LTs do not perceive representations effectively across loops, only in the final loop.

Conclusion: LTs provide potential for scaling depth but lack true introspection capacity to link representation and language effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit a gap between their internal knowledge and their explicit linguistic outputs. In this report, we empirically investigate whether Looped Transformers (LTs)--architectures that increase computational depth by iterating shared layers--can bridge this gap by utilizing their iterative nature as a form of introspection. Our experiments reveal that while increasing loop iterations narrows the gap, it is partly driven by a degradation of their internal knowledge carried by representations. Moreover, another empirical analysis suggests that current LTs' ability to perceive representations does not improve across loops; it is only present in the final loop. These results suggest that while LTs offer a promising direction for scaling computational depth, they have yet to achieve the introspection required to truly link representation space and natural language.

Motivation: The shortage of mental healthcare providers and increasing demand for services drives the need for AI systems to assist experts effectively.

Method: CoTherapist utilizes a small language model with fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and agentic reasoning. T-BARS and psychometric profiling were applied to evaluate empathy and personality traits.

Result: CoTherapist delivers clinically grounded, empathetic, and trustworthy responses validated by human evaluation, showcasing expert-like behavior.

Conclusion: Small language models can be engineered to supplement mental health care by scaling intelligent and safe therapeutic tools.

Abstract: Access to mental healthcare is increasingly strained by workforce shortages and rising demand, motivating the development of intelligent systems that can support mental healthcare experts. We introduce coTherapist, a unified framework utilizing a small language model to emulate core therapeutic competencies through domain-specific fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, and agentic reasoning. Evaluation on clinical queries demonstrates that coTherapist generates more relevant and clinically grounded responses than contemporary baselines. Using our novel T-BARS rubric and psychometric profiling, we confirm coTherapist exhibits high empathy and therapist-consistent personality traits. Furthermore, human evaluation by domain experts validates that coTherapist delivers accurate, trustworthy, and safe responses. coTherapist was deployed and tested by clinical experts. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that small models can be engineered to exhibit expert-like behavior, offering a scalable pathway for digital mental health tools.

### [108] [Untangling Input Language from Reasoning Language: A Diagnostic Framework for Cross-Lingual Moral Alignment in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10257)
*Nan Li,Bo Kang,Tijl De Bie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) judge moral dilemmas across different languages, introducing a methodology to distinguish reasoning-language effects from input-language effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand language-specific influences on LLM moral dilemma judgments and identify whether their reasoning in different languages changes conclusions.

Method: The authors separate language factors by manipulating input and reasoning languages independently, using Moral Foundations Theory to interpret moral judgments, and analyzing the outcomes with 13 LLMs across English and Chinese moral dilemmas.

Result: (1) Reasoning-language effects contribute twice the variance compared to input-language effects; (2) context-dependency is detected in nearly half of models; (3) diagnostic taxonomy aids deployment guidance.

Conclusion: The introduced methodology is effective for isolating and analyzing language-based influences on LLM moral reasoning, offering insights for better deployment practices and releasing related resources.

Abstract: When LLMs judge moral dilemmas, do they reach different conclusions in different languages, and if so, why? Two factors could drive such differences: the language of the dilemma itself, or the language in which the model reasons. Standard evaluation conflates these by testing only matched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with English reasoning). We introduce a methodology that separately manipulates each factor, covering also mismatched conditions (e.g., English dilemma with Chinese reasoning), enabling decomposition of their contributions. To study \emph{what} changes, we propose an approach to interpret the moral judgments in terms of Moral Foundations Theory. As a side result, we identify evidence for splitting the Authority dimension into a family-related and an institutional dimension. Applying this methodology to English-Chinese moral judgment with 13 LLMs, we demonstrate its diagnostic power: (1) the framework isolates reasoning-language effects as contributing twice the variance of input-language effects; (2) it detects context-dependency in nearly half of models that standard evaluation misses; and (3) a diagnostic taxonomy translates these patterns into deployment guidance. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CrossCulturalMoralJudgement.

*Hiroaki Yamagiwa,Yusuke Takase,Hidetoshi Shimodaira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Projection Kernel (PK) as a new metric to analyze relationships between attention heads in Transformers, providing better clarity and insights than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics fail to effectively capture structural relationships between attention heads in Transformer models, making it challenging to interpret their internal mechanisms.

Method: The authors propose the Projection Kernel (PK), a metric based on principal-angle subspace similarity. PK is complemented by a novel framework comparing its distributions to a reference derived from random orthogonal subspaces.

Result: PK successfully reproduces known head-to-head interactions in the IOI task more effectively than prior metrics like the Composition Score. It also identifies significant patterns, such as L4H7 acting as a hub in GPT2-small.

Conclusion: Projection Kernel offers a superior approach for understanding the roles and relationships of attention heads in Transformers, uncovering clearer structural insights compared to existing efforts.

Abstract: Understanding relationships between attention heads is essential for interpreting the internal structure of Transformers, yet existing metrics do not capture this structure well. We focus on the subspaces spanned by attention-head weight matrices and quantify head-to-head relationships using the Projection Kernel (PK), a principal-angle-based measure of subspace similarity. Experiments show that PK reproduces known head-to-head interactions on the IOI task more clearly than prior metrics such as the Composition Score. We further introduce a framework to quantify the informativeness of PK distributions by comparing them with a reference distribution derived from random orthogonal subspaces. As an application, we analyze a directed graph constructed from PK and show that, in GPT2-small, L4H7 acts as a hub by functioning as an identity head.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoST introduces a novel multimodal architecture to integrate speech and text for better cross-modal understanding through specialized routing and modality-aware experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models struggle with processing different modalities effectively due to identical parameter application across diverse modalities.

Method: MoST employs the Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture, featuring modality-specific routing pathways, expert groups, and shared experts, along with a strategic post-training pipeline using open-source datasets.

Result: MoST achieves superior performance across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks, outperforming comparable models in its class.

Conclusion: MoST proves its efficacy as the first open-source multimodal LLM based on Mixture of Experts architecture, addressing challenges effectively in cross-modal tasks.

Abstract: We present MoST (Mixture of Speech and Text), a novel multimodal large language model that seamlessly integrates speech and text processing through our proposed Modality-Aware Mixture of Experts (MAMoE) architecture. While current multimodal models typically process diverse modality representations with identical parameters, disregarding their inherent representational differences, we introduce specialized routing pathways that direct tokens to modality-appropriate experts based on input type. MAMoE simultaneously enhances modality-specific learning and cross-modal understanding through two complementary components: modality-specific expert groups that capture domain-specific patterns and shared experts that facilitate information transfer between modalities. Building on this architecture, we develop an efficient transformation pipeline that adapts the pretrained MoE language model through strategic post-training on ASR and TTS datasets, followed by fine-tuning with a carefully curated speech-text instruction dataset. A key feature of this pipeline is that it relies exclusively on fully accessible, open-source datasets to achieve strong performance and data efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across ASR, TTS, audio language modeling, and spoken question answering benchmarks show that MoST consistently outperforms existing models of comparable parameter counts. Our ablation studies confirm that the modality-specific routing mechanism and shared experts design significantly contribute to performance gains across all tested domains. To our knowledge, MoST represents the first fully open-source speech-text LLM built on a Mixture of Experts architecture. \footnote{We release MoST model, training code, inference code, and training data at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/MoST

*Luoming Hu,Jingjie Zeng,Liang Yang,Hongfei Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents methods to enhance moral alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Moral Foundations Theory by mapping and manipulating intrinsic moral representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving moral alignment in LLMs is critical for AI safety, but current techniques don't deeply modify intrinsic representations.

Method: The authors use Moral Foundations Theory for linear probing, extracting steerable Moral Vectors, and propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF) for inference-time intervention.

Result: Results demonstrate improved LLM accuracy in distinguishing benign and malicious intent, while safeguarding against jailbreak attempts.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances moral alignment, showcasing a significant improvement in intrinsic defenses and trade-offs in AI interactions.

Abstract: Enhancing the moral alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in AI safety. Current alignment techniques often act as superficial guardrails, leaving the intrinsic moral representations of LLMs largely untouched. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to map and manipulate the fine-grained moral landscape of LLMs. Through cross-lingual linear probing, we validate the shared nature of moral representations in middle layers and uncover a shared yet different moral subspace between English and Chinese. Building upon this, we extract steerable Moral Vectors and successfully validate their efficacy at both internal and behavioral levels. Leveraging the high generalizability of morality, we propose Adaptive Moral Fusion (AMF), a dynamic inference-time intervention that synergizes probe detection with vector injection to tackle the safety-helpfulness trade-off. Empirical results confirm that our approach acts as a targeted intrinsic defense, effectively reducing incorrect refusals on benign queries while minimizing jailbreak success rates compared to standard baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SENSIA, a method for adapting language models across languages by aligning sense-level representations rather than relying on shared parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multilingual language understanding by aligning latent sense representations across languages rather than focusing on shared parameters and scale.

Method: SENSIA explicitly aligns sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data while training a target-language language modeling loss to maintain fluency.

Result: SENSIA outperforms similar multilingual alignment methods across benchmarks and achieves competitive accuracy with significantly less target-language data.

Conclusion: The sense-based alignment approach is effective and consistent, preserving sense geometry and achieving robust results across diverse languages.

Abstract: We approach multilinguality as sense adaptation: aligning latent meaning representations across languages rather than relying solely on shared parameters and scale. In this paper, we introduce SENse-based Symmetric Interlingual Alignment (SENSIA), which adapts a Backpack language model from one language to another by explicitly aligning sense-level mixtures and contextual representations on parallel data, while jointly training a target-language language modeling loss to preserve fluency. Across benchmarks on four typologically diverse languages, SENSIA generally outperforms comparable multilingual alignment methods and achieves competitive accuracy against monolingual from-scratch baselines while using 2-4x less target-language data. Analyses of learned sense geometry indicate that local sense topology and global structure relative to English are largely preserved, and ablations show that the method is robust in terms of design and scale.

TL;DR: This paper introduces BAR-SQL, a framework enhancing SQL query generation with reliability and boundary awareness, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to leading models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to improve SQL generation accuracy while handling ambiguous and boundary cases effectively in enterprise settings.

Method: BAR-SQL involves Seed Mutation data synthesis, Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis, a two-stage model training process (SFT and Group Relative Policy Optimization), and a hybrid reward mechanism for SQL accuracy and semantic precision.

Result: BAR-SQL achieved 91.48% average accuracy on a new benchmark (Ent-SQL-Bench), surpassing top models in SQL generation and boundary-aware abstention.

Conclusion: BAR-SQL's innovative methods enhance enterprise SQL generation and reliability, setting a new performance benchmark in the domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BAR-SQL (Boundary-Aware Reliable NL2SQL), a unified training framework that embeds reliability and boundary awareness directly into the generation process. We introduce a Seed Mutation data synthesis paradigm that constructs a representative enterprise corpus, explicitly encompassing multi-step analytical queries alongside boundary cases including ambiguity and schema limitations. To ensure interpretability, we employ Knowledge-Grounded Reasoning Synthesis, which produces Chain-of-Thought traces explicitly anchored in schema metadata and business rules. The model is trained through a two-stage process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. We design a Task-Conditioned Hybrid Reward mechanism that simultaneously optimizes SQL execution accuracy-leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree analysis and dense result matching-and semantic precision in abstention responses. To evaluate reliability alongside generation accuracy, we construct and release Ent-SQL-Bench, which jointly assesse SQL precision and boundary-aware abstention across ambiguous and unanswerable queries. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate that BAR-SQL achieves 91.48% average accuracy, outperforming leading proprietary models, including Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5, in both SQL generation quality and boundary-aware abstention capability.

*Warren Jouanneau,Emma Jouffroy,Marc Palyart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel re-ranking model for person-job matching using a late cross-attention approach for handling long, multilingual resumes and project briefs efficiently. A large language model (LLM) is used to generate enriched supervision for training. The proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matching the right person to a job proposal in real-time is complex due to the length, structure, and multilingual nature of resumes. The paper addresses the need for efficient and accurate job matching models.

Method: The method involves using a late cross-attention architecture to handle long-context inputs effectively. A generative large language model (LLM) acts as a teacher to produce rich supervision signals, which are distilled into a student model using an enriched distillation loss function. This results in interpretable and effective skill-fit scores.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in experiments measuring relevance, ranking, and calibration, demonstrating its efficacy in person-job matching.

Conclusion: The proposed re-ranking model offers a scalable, interpretable, and accurate solution for real-time person-job matching, overcoming limitations of current systems and addressing biases in historical data.

Abstract: Finding the most relevant person for a job proposal in real time is challenging, especially when resumes are long, structured, and multilingual. In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OctoBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in scaffold-aware instruction-following for coding tasks in diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in understanding how LLMs handle scaffold-specified instructions, especially when constraints are both heterogeneous and persistent across interactions.

Method: The authors created OctoBench, a benchmark comprising 34 environments, 217 tasks, 7,098 checklist items, and an automated scoring toolkit. Eight models were tested to assess performance gaps.

Result: Experiments reveal that there is a systematic gap between accomplishing tasks and complying with scaffold-specific instructions.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights the need for improved training and evaluation approaches for LLMs to better follow heterogeneous and scaffold-aware instructions. OctoBench is made publicly available to aid future research.

Abstract: Modern coding scaffolds turn LLMs into capable software agents, but their ability to follow scaffold-specified instructions remains under-examined, especially when constraints are heterogeneous and persist across interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce OctoBench, which benchmarks scaffold-aware instruction following in repository-grounded agentic coding. OctoBench includes 34 environments and 217 tasks instantiated under three scaffold types, and is paired with 7,098 objective checklist items. To disentangle solving the task from following the rules, we provide an automated observation-and-scoring toolkit that captures full trajectories and performs fine-grained checks. Experiments on eight representative models reveal a systematic gap between task-solving and scaffold-aware compliance, underscoring the need for training and evaluation that explicitly targets heterogeneous instruction following. We release the benchmark to support reproducible benchmarking and to accelerate the development of more scaffold-aware coding agents.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in continual distillation for models with strong reasoning ability by proposing a token-level approach (T3S) to improve optimization and training performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continual distillation methods face performance bottlenecks when applied to students already possessing strong reasoning abilities, leading to degraded model efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S), a token-level training adjustment method targeting under-optimized tokens to clear bottlenecks in continual distillation.

Result: T3S achieves superior results with minimal data: Qwen3-8B outperforms DeepSeek-R1; Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B; LLaDA-2.0-Mini achieves state-of-the-art performance for 16B models.

Conclusion: The proposed T3S method effectively addresses distillation challenges and enhances reasoning model efficiency, positioning itself as a significant advancement for competitive benchmarks.

Abstract: Efficient distillation is a key pathway for converting expensive reasoning capability into deployable efficiency, yet in the frontier regime where the student already has strong reasoning ability, naive continual distillation often yields limited gains or even degradation. We observe a characteristic training phenomenon: even as loss decreases monotonically, all performance metrics can drop sharply at almost the same bottleneck, before gradually recovering. We further uncover a token-level mechanism: confidence bifurcates into steadily increasing Imitation-Anchor Tokens that quickly anchor optimization and other yet-to-learn tokens whose confidence is suppressed until after the bottleneck. And the characteristic that these two types of tokens cannot coexist is the root cause of the failure in continual distillation. To this end, we propose Training-Trajectory-Aware Token Selection (T3S) to reconstruct the training objective at the token level, clearing the optimization path for yet-to-learn tokens. T3 yields consistent gains in both AR and dLLM settings: with only hundreds of examples, Qwen3-8B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 on competitive reasoning benchmarks, Qwen3-32B approaches Qwen3-235B, and T3-trained LLaDA-2.0-Mini exceeds its AR baseline, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all of 16B-scale no-think models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data for improving the capability of large language models in multi-turn interactions.

Method: The paper proposes GEM, a data synthesis pipeline, which includes relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. It also introduces a Trajectory Synthesizer that simplifies this process using supervised fine-tuning.

Result: The GEM pipeline and Trajectory Synthesizer show superior generalization capabilities. Specifically, GEM-32B improves performance by 16.5% on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark and achieves comparable or better results than models trained on domain-specific data while significantly reducing latency and costs.

Conclusion: The study validates the effectiveness and efficiency of leveraging textual corpora for generating multi-turn tool-use data. The proposed method efficiently scales, reduces costs, and generalizes well, facilitating the broader use of large language models in tool-use tasks.

Abstract: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively utilize tools in multi-turn interactions is essential for building capable autonomous agents. However, acquiring diverse and realistic multi-turn tool-use data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-based paradigm. We observe that textual corpora naturally contain rich, multi-step problem-solving experiences, which can serve as an untapped, scalable, and authentic data source for multi-turn tool-use tasks. Based on this insight, we introduce GEM, a data synthesis pipeline that enables the generation and extraction of multi-turn tool-use trajectories from text corpora through a four-stage process: relevance filtering, workflow & tool extraction, trajectory grounding, and complexity refinement. To reduce the computational cost, we further train a specialized Trajectory Synthesizer via supervised fine-tuning. This model distills the complex generation pipeline into an efficient, end-to-end trajectory generator. Experiments demonstrate that our GEM-32B achieve a 16.5% improvement on the BFCL V3 Multi-turn benchmark. Our models partially surpass the performance of models trained on τ - bench (Airline and Retail) in-domain data, highlighting the superior generalization capability derived from our text-based synthesis paradigm. Notably, our Trajectory Synthesizer matches the quality of the full pipeline while significantly reducing inference latency and costs.

Method: The authors analyze activation directions in model personas across various models, investigate the Assistant Axis, and restrict activations to stabilize model behavior under challenging conditions.

Result: The Assistant Axis captures varying archetypes within language models, with deviations causing persona drift. Steering techniques along the axis help stabilize behavior and prevent adversarial jailbreaks.

Conclusion: Anchoring models deeply within a coherent persona space is essential to prevent harmful persona drift and enhance their stability and reliability in interactions.

Abstract: Large language models can represent a variety of personas but typically default to a helpful Assistant identity cultivated during post-training. We investigate the structure of the space of model personas by extracting activation directions corresponding to diverse character archetypes. Across several different models, we find that the leading component of this persona space is an "Assistant Axis," which captures the extent to which a model is operating in its default Assistant mode. Steering towards the Assistant direction reinforces helpful and harmless behavior; steering away increases the model's tendency to identify as other entities. Moreover, steering away with more extreme values often induces a mystical, theatrical speaking style. We find this axis is also present in pre-trained models, where it primarily promotes helpful human archetypes like consultants and coaches and inhibits spiritual ones. Measuring deviations along the Assistant Axis predicts "persona drift," a phenomenon where models slip into exhibiting harmful or bizarre behaviors that are uncharacteristic of their typical persona. We find that persona drift is often driven by conversations demanding meta-reflection on the model's processes or featuring emotionally vulnerable users. We show that restricting activations to a fixed region along the Assistant Axis can stabilize model behavior in these scenarios -- and also in the face of adversarial persona-based jailbreaks. Our results suggest that post-training steers models toward a particular region of persona space but only loosely tethers them to it, motivating work on training and steering strategies that more deeply anchor models to a coherent persona.

### [120] [INDIC DIALECT: A Multi Task Benchmark to Evaluate and Translate in Indian Language Dialects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10388)
*Tarun Sharma,Manikandan Ravikiran,Sourava Kumar Behera,Pramit Bhattacharya,Arnab Bhattacharya,Rohit Saluja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces INDIC-DIALECT, a 13,000-pair corpus covering 11 dialects of Hindi and Odia, and establishes it as a benchmark for dialect-based NLP tasks in Indian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the underrepresentation of Indian dialects, particularly of Hindi and Odia, in NLP research, despite their wide usage. It aims to bridge the resource gap for these low-resource dialects.

Method: The study presents a human-curated parallel corpus and constructs a multi-task benchmark for dialect classification, MCQ answering, and machine translation. It evaluates performance using various models, including LLMs and fine-tuned transformer models.

Result: Experiments show poor performance of LLMs like GPT-4o on dialect classification, while fine-tuned Indian language transformers significantly improve results. Notable improvements are reported in BLEU scores for both dialect-to-language and language-to-dialect translation tasks, with hybrid and rule-based AI models outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: INDIC-DIALECT serves as a new resource and benchmark for advancing research in dialect-aware NLP for Indian languages, with plans for open-source availability to assist further studies.

Abstract: Recent NLP advances focus primarily on standardized languages, leaving most low-resource dialects under-served especially in Indian scenarios. In India, the issue is particularly important: despite Hindi being the third most spoken language globally (over 600 million speakers), its numerous dialects remain underrepresented. The situation is similar for Odia, which has around 45 million speakers. While some datasets exist which contain standard Hindi and Odia languages, their regional dialects have almost no web presence. We introduce INDIC-DIALECT, a human-curated parallel corpus of 13k sentence pairs spanning 11 dialects and 2 languages: Hindi and Odia. Using this corpus, we construct a multi-task benchmark with three tasks: dialect classification, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and machine translation (MT). Our experiments show that LLMs like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 perform poorly on the classification task. While fine-tuned transformer based models pretrained on Indian languages substantially improve performance e.g., improving F1 from 19.6\% to 89.8\% on dialect classification. For dialect to language translation, we find that hybrid AI model achieves highest BLEU score of 61.32 compared to the baseline score of 23.36. Interestingly, due to complexity in generating dialect sentences, we observe that for language to dialect translation the ``rule-based followed by AI" approach achieves best BLEU score of 48.44 compared to the baseline score of 27.59. INDIC-DIALECT thus is a new benchmark for dialect-aware Indic NLP, and we plan to release it as open source to support further work on low-resource Indian dialects.

*Mihai Dan Nadas,Laura Diosan,Andreea Tomescu,Andrei Piscoran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TF3-RO is a pipeline for training compact Romanian language models and generating large-scale synthetic narrative corpora, leveraging linguistic coherence, tokenizer optimization, and model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a reproducible framework for training language models and generating synthetic data for morphologically rich and under-resourced languages like Romanian.

Method: Developed TF3-RO pipeline, including tokenizer training, from-scratch pretraining of a Romanian-specific Transformer model, compression using quantization and pruning, and controlled synthetic data generation.

Result: Trained a compact 26.45M-parameter Romanian language model capable of generating three million high-quality Romanian-centric synthetic stories.

Conclusion: TF3-RO offers a comprehensive and reproducible approach for compact language modeling and synthetic data generation in Romanian, providing strong evaluation and deployment features.

Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic data generation have shown that compact language models can be trained effectively when the underlying corpus is structurally controlled and linguistically coherent. However, for morphologically rich and computationally under-resourced languages such as Romanian, there is still no openly documented, end-to-end pipeline that unifies tokenizer design, preprocessing, pretraining, compression, evaluation, and large-scale synthetic data generation in a reproducible framework. Building on TF1, a three-million-story English fable dataset, and TF2, which extends TF1 through high-quality Romanian translations, we introduce TF3-RO, a Romanian-centric language modeling pipeline spanning tokenizer training, from-scratch model development, and Romanian-native dataset generation. TF3-RO constructs Romanian-specific BPE and Unigram tokenizers from a linguistically informed corpus to mitigate token inflation induced by Romanian morphology. Using long-sequence packed training, we pretrain a 51.65M-parameter LLaMA-style Transformer entirely from scratch. The model is subsequently optimized through quantization, structured pruning, and logit-based knowledge distillation, yielding a compact 26.45M-parameter student model with tied embeddings and strong deployment characteristics. Using this distilled model, TF3-RO generates three million Romanian-native synthetic fables via a controlled combinatorial prompting framework. Across all stages, the pipeline integrates a comprehensive evaluation suite combining intrinsic metrics, Romanian agreement probes, entity coherence, rule-based grammar checking, and LLM-based assessment. TF3-RO provides a reproducible and linguistically grounded framework for training compact Romanian language models and producing large-scale synthetic narrative corpora.

### [122] [Are Language Models Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10421)
*Philip Resnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language Models (LMs) are not well-suited as model systems for cognitive processes across Marr's three levels of analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the validity of claims that LMs can serve as cognitive models by examining them across Marr’s levels—implementation, algorithmic-representational, and computational theory.

Method: The paper analyzes LMs against Marr's framework of three levels of cognitive modeling.

Result: LMs fail as model systems on the implementation level, are poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and problematic at the computational theory level.

Conclusion: While LMs are effective tools, categorizing them as cognitive models is an overstatement that contributes to unnecessary hype around LLMs.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald claim LMs "serve as model systems", but an assessment at each of Marr's three levels suggests the claim is clearly not true at the implementation level, poorly motivated at the algorithmic-representational level, and problematic at the computational theory level. LMs are good candidates as tools; calling them cognitive models overstates the case and unnecessarily feeds LLM hype.

*Abhinaba Basu,Pavan Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bias in AI models can shift dramatically depending on contextual framing, even with fixed stereotype content. This paper introduces Contextual StereoSet and Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF) to evaluate bias more robustly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue where AI models tested for bias in fixed conditions do not generalize well to deployment scenarios with varying contexts.

Method: The study introduces Contextual StereoSet, varying contextual framing while keeping stereotype content fixed, and proposes CSF for compact profiling of bias sensitivity with paired contrasts, statistical corrections, and flexible evaluation tracks.

Result: Bias shifts significantly depending on contextual prompts like time, place, and audience. Models exhibited patterns such as increased stereotype selection in 1990 vs 2030 and contextual effects like gossip framing raising bias.

Conclusion: Bias evaluation must consider sensitivity to contextual changes rather than fixed conditions. The introduced benchmark and CSF methods offer robust approaches to assess bias across varying contexts.

Abstract: A model that avoids stereotypes in a lab benchmark may not avoid them in deployment. We show that measured bias shifts dramatically when prompts mention different places, times, or audiences -- no adversarial prompting required.
  We introduce Contextual StereoSet, a benchmark that holds stereotype content fixed while systematically varying contextual framing. Testing 13 models across two protocols, we find striking patterns: anchoring to 1990 (vs. 2030) raises stereotype selection in all models tested on this contrast (p<0.05); gossip framing raises it in 5 of 6 full-grid models; out-group observer framing shifts it by up to 13 percentage points. These effects replicate in hiring, lending, and help-seeking vignettes.
  We propose Context Sensitivity Fingerprints (CSF): a compact profile of per-dimension dispersion and paired contrasts with bootstrap CIs and FDR correction. Two evaluation tracks support different use cases -- a 360-context diagnostic grid for deep analysis and a budgeted protocol covering 4,229 items for production screening.
  The implication is methodological: bias scores from fixed-condition tests may not generalize.This is not a claim about ground-truth bias rates; it is a stress test of evaluation robustness. CSF forces evaluators to ask, "Under what conditions does bias appear?" rather than "Is this model biased?" We release our benchmark, code, and results.

*Yiwen Gao,Ruochen Zhao,Yang Deng,Wenxuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR-Arena, an evaluation framework for assessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dynamic and autonomous research tasks with real-time adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current LLM evaluation benchmarks, including their reliance on static datasets, lack of generality, and data contamination.

Method: DR-Arena evaluates LLMs using real-time Information Trees from current web trends to create adaptive tasks. It employs an automated Examiner to test deep reasoning and wide knowledge coverage and escalates task complexity dynamically through an Adaptive Evolvement Loop.

Result: DR-Arena achieves a high 0.94 Spearman correlation with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard and aligns closely with human evaluations without requiring manual adjudication.

Conclusion: DR-Arena provides a reliable, adaptable, and automated solution for evaluating LLM capabilities, reducing reliance on costly human evaluation and achieving state-of-the-art alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as Deep Research (DR) Agents capable of autonomous investigation and information synthesis, reliable evaluation of their task performance has become a critical bottleneck. Current benchmarks predominantly rely on static datasets, which suffer from several limitations: limited task generality, temporal misalignment, and data contamination. To address these, we introduce DR-Arena, a fully automated evaluation framework that pushes DR agents to their capability limits through dynamic investigation. DR-Arena constructs real-time Information Trees from fresh web trends to ensure the evaluation rubric is synchronized with the live world state, and employs an automated Examiner to generate structured tasks testing two orthogonal capabilities: Deep reasoning and Wide coverage. DR-Arena further adopts Adaptive Evolvement Loop, a state-machine controller that dynamically escalates task complexity based on real-time performance, demanding deeper deduction or wider aggregation until a decisive capability boundary emerges. Experiments with six advanced DR agents demonstrate that DR-Arena achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the LMSYS Search Arena leaderboard. This represents the state-of-the-art alignment with human preferences without any manual efforts, validating DR-Arena as a reliable alternative for costly human adjudication.

### [125] [AEQ-Bench: Measuring Empathy of Omni-Modal Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10513)
*Xuan Luo,Lewei Yao,Libo Zhao,Lanqing Hong,Kai Chen,Dehua Tao,Daxin Tan,Ruifeng Xu,Jing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AEQ-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating empathetic capabilities of omni-modal large models through audio and text inputs and outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle the challenge of evaluating empathetic capabilities in omni-modal large models, which require handling affectivity across multiple modalities.

Method: The authors developed AEQ-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess models on generating empathetic audio-based responses and judging empathy in audio responses, with varying contextual and tonal settings.

Result: Models with audio output capabilities generally outperformed text-only models, but fine-grained paralinguistic evaluation remains unreliable.

Conclusion: AEQ-Bench advances empathy evaluation in multi-modal models, but challenges remain in assessing paralinguistic expressiveness.

Abstract: While the automatic evaluation of omni-modal large models (OLMs) is essential, assessing empathy remains a significant challenge due to its inherent affectivity. To investigate this challenge, we introduce AEQ-Bench (Audio Empathy Quotient Benchmark), a novel benchmark to systematically assess two core empathetic capabilities of OLMs: (i) generating empathetic responses by comprehending affective cues from multi-modal inputs (audio + text), and (ii) judging the empathy of audio responses without relying on text transcription. Compared to existing benchmarks, AEQ-Bench incorporates two novel settings that vary in context specificity and speech tone. Comprehensive assessment across linguistic and paralinguistic metrics reveals that (1) OLMs trained with audio output capabilities generally outperformed models with text-only outputs, and (2) while OLMs align with human judgments for coarse-grained quality assessment, they remain unreliable for evaluating fine-grained paralinguistic expressiveness.

*Chengbing Wang,Wuqiang Zheng,Yang Zhang,Fengbin Zhu,Junyi Cheng,Yi Xie,Wenjie Wang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces PERM, a reward model grounded in psychology, to enhance emotional support in LLMs via a bidirectional empathy evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Language Models fail to provide substantial emotional support and current empathy reward models are limited to a single perspective.

Method: PERM employs a bidirectional decomposition for empathy assessment, incorporating the supporter, seeker, and a bystander perspective to evaluate interaction quality.

Result: Experiments show PERM outperforms baselines by over 10% and is preferred by 70% of users in blinded studies.

Conclusion: PERM effectively improves empathetic responses in LLMs, promising advancements in human-centric applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in human-centric applications, yet they often fail to provide substantive emotional support. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been utilized to enhance empathy of LLMs, existing reward models typically evaluate empathy from a single perspective, overlooking the inherently bidirectional interaction nature of empathy between the supporter and seeker as defined by Empathy Cycle theory. To address this limitation, we propose Psychology-grounded Empathetic Reward Modeling (PERM). PERM operationalizes empathy evaluation through a bidirectional decomposition: 1) Supporter perspective, assessing internal resonation and communicative expression; 2) Seeker perspective, evaluating emotional reception. Additionally, it incorporates a bystander perspective to monitor overall interaction quality. Extensive experiments on a widely-used emotional intelligence benchmark and an industrial daily conversation dataset demonstrate that PERM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\%. Furthermore, a blinded user study reveals a 70\% preference for our approach, highlighting its efficacy in generating more empathetic responses. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/ZhengWwwq/PERM.

*Syed Naveed Mahmood,Md. Rezaur Rahman Bhuiyan,Tasfia Zaman,Jareen Tasneem Khondaker,Md. Sameer Sakib,Nazia Tasnim,Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF) to eradicate selected knowledge from language models, achieving more effective erasure than prior methods, while maintaining model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method for selective knowledge erasure from large language models (LLMs) for compliance with GDPR and enhancing model safety, addressing the limitations of current methods that fail to fully remove latent knowledge.

Method: KIF leverages a representation-aware architecture, combining dynamic suppression of specific internal representations and parameter-efficient adaptation, rather than relying on surface-level behavioral modifications.

Result: KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99) with oracle-level utility (MU = 0.62), and its effectiveness is validated on multiple large-scale models, uncovering fundamental architectural differences between standard and reasoning-prior models.

Conclusion: KIF successfully distinguishes genuine knowledge erasure from obfuscation while overcoming prior tradeoffs between stability and erasure, offering a novel dual-metric evaluation protocol for assessing model behavior.

Abstract: Selective knowledge erasure from LLMs is critical for GDPR compliance and model safety, yet current unlearning methods conflate behavioral suppression with true knowledge removal, allowing latent capabilities to persist beneath surface-level refusals. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing Knowledge Immunization Framework (KIF), a representation-aware architecture that distinguishes genuine erasure from obfuscation by targeting internal activation signatures rather than surface outputs. Our approach combines dynamic suppression of subject-specific representations with parameter-efficient adaptation, enabling durable unlearning without full model retraining. KIF achieves near-oracle erasure (FQ approx 0.99 vs. 1.00) while preserving utility at oracle levels (MU = 0.62), effectively breaking the stability-erasure tradeoff that has constrained all prior work. We evaluate both standard foundation models (Llama and Mistral) and reasoning-prior models (Qwen and DeepSeek) across 3B to 14B parameters. Our observation shows that standard models exhibit scale-independent true erasure (<3% utility drift), while reasoning-prior models reveal fundamental architectural divergence. Our comprehensive dual-metric evaluation protocol, combining surface-level leakage with latent trace persistence, operationalizes the obfuscation - erasure distinction and enables the first systematic diagnosis of mechanism-level forgetting behavior across model families and scales.

*Wessel Poelman,Miryam de Lhoneux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation metrics for conditional language models lack universal comparability in multilingual setups due to intrinsic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of intrinsic evaluation metrics, such as perplexity, in multilingual setups and clarify underlying assumptions.

Method: Analyzed six metrics across mono- and multilingual models using two multi-parallel corpora while outlining explicit assumptions and implications.

Result: Current metrics do not allow for universal comparison in multilingual setups due to discrepancies in measuring semantic vs. information-theoretic content.

Conclusion: Intrinsic evaluation metrics must account for differences in multilingual contexts, as they currently fail to ensure accurate cross-language model comparisons.

Abstract: Intrinsic evaluation metrics for conditional language models, such as perplexity or bits-per-character, are widely used in both mono- and multilingual settings. These metrics are rather straightforward to use and compare in monolingual setups, but rest on a number of assumptions in multilingual setups. One such assumption is that comparing the perplexity of CLMs on parallel sentences is indicative of their quality since the information content (here understood as the semantic meaning) is the same. However, the metrics are inherently measuring information content in the information-theoretic sense. We make this and other such assumptions explicit and discuss their implications. We perform experiments with six metrics on two multi-parallel corpora both with mono- and multilingual models. Ultimately, we find that current metrics are not universally comparable. We look at the form-meaning debate to provide some explanation for this.

*Yuxi Xia,Loris Schoenegger,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores why large language models (LLMs) verbalize overconfident outputs and introduces a method, TracVC, to analyze the origin of confidence expressions in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of verbalized confidence of LLMs that is often misaligned with factual accuracy, making them unreliable in trust-critical scenarios.

Method: The paper presents TracVC, a method combining information retrieval and influence estimation to trace confidence expressions back to their training data. It also introduces a metric, content groundness, to evaluate whether LLMs base confidence on relevant content or superficial training data.

Result: The study found that models like OLMo2-13B often rely on superficial, unrelated expressions of confidence rather than grounding in relevant, content-based training data.

Conclusion: Current training methods lead LLMs to mimic confident language without adequately justifying that confidence, highlighting the need for improved training to ensure trustworthy confidence expressions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can increase users' perceived trust by verbalizing confidence in their outputs. However, prior work has shown that LLMs are often overconfident, making their stated confidence unreliable since it does not consistently align with factual accuracy. To better understand the sources of this verbalized confidence, we introduce TracVC (\textbf{Trac}ing \textbf{V}erbalized \textbf{C}onfidence), a method that builds on information retrieval and influence estimation to trace generated confidence expressions back to the training data. We evaluate TracVC on OLMo and Llama models in a question answering setting, proposing a new metric, content groundness, which measures the extent to which an LLM grounds its confidence in content-related training examples (relevant to the question and answer) versus in generic examples of confidence verbalization. Our analysis reveals that OLMo2-13B is frequently influenced by confidence-related data that is lexically unrelated to the query, suggesting that it may mimic superficial linguistic expressions of certainty rather than rely on genuine content grounding. These findings point to a fundamental limitation in current training regimes: LLMs may learn how to sound confident without learning when confidence is justified. Our analysis provides a foundation for improving LLMs' trustworthiness in expressing more reliable confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving detection of persuasion in argumentative text to enhance communication analysis.

Method: Leverages large language models with Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring to analyze persuasion strategies and the impact of discussion topics.

Result: Strategy-guided reasoning improves persuasiveness prediction, and a new topic-annotated dataset facilitates further research.

Conclusion: Structured, strategy-aware prompting enhances interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.

Abstract: Detecting persuasion in argumentative text is a challenging task with important implications for understanding human communication. This work investigates the role of persuasion strategies - such as Attack on reputation, Distraction, and Manipulative wording - in determining the persuasiveness of a text. We conduct experiments on three annotated argument datasets: Winning Arguments (built from the Change My View subreddit), Anthropic/Persuasion, and Persuasion for Good. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with a Multi-Strategy Persuasion Scoring approach that guides reasoning over six persuasion strategies. Results show that strategy-guided reasoning improves the prediction of persuasiveness. To better understand the influence of content, we organize the Winning Argument dataset into broad discussion topics and analyze performance across them. We publicly release this topic-annotated version of the dataset to facilitate future research. Overall, our methodology demonstrates the value of structured, strategy-aware prompting for enhancing interpretability and robustness in argument quality assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LIBERTy, a benchmark for faithful concept-based explanations using structural counterfactual pairs, validated across various datasets with new evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating the faithfulness of concept-based explanations without relying on costly and imperfect human-written counterfactuals.

Method: The authors propose LIBERTy, a framework that constructs datasets with structural counterfactual pairs through Structured Causal Models (SCMs) and LLMs, introducing datasets and evaluation metric (order-faithfulness) for assessment.

Result: The paper applies LIBERTy on multiple datasets, evaluates methods and models, identifies areas for improvement in concept-based explanations, and discovers proprietary LLMs have reduced sensitivity to demographic interventions.

Conclusion: LIBERTy offers an important benchmark to develop and evaluate faithful explainability methods, facilitating progress in understanding model behavior in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that serve as an imperfect proxy. To address this, we introduce a framework for constructing datasets containing structural counterfactual pairs: LIBERTy (LLM-based Interventional Benchmark for Explainability with Reference Targets). LIBERTy is grounded in explicitly defined Structured Causal Models (SCMs) of the text generation, interventions on a concept propagate through the SCM until an LLM generates the counterfactual. We introduce three datasets (disease detection, CV screening, and workplace violence prediction) together with a new evaluation metric, order-faithfulness. Using them, we evaluate a wide range of methods across five models and identify substantial headroom for improving concept-based explanations. LIBERTy also enables systematic analysis of model sensitivity to interventions: we find that proprietary LLMs show markedly reduced sensitivity to demographic concepts, likely due to post-training mitigation. Overall, LIBERTy provides a much-needed benchmark for developing faithful explainability methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces STITCH, a memory system to improve long-horizon reasoning in goal-oriented tasks by using structured intent tracking to reduce memory retrieval errors, achieving significant improvements on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of deploying large language models in long-horizon tasks arises due to recurring entities under different goals, leading to context-mismatched evidence retrieval.

Method: STITCH uses a structured retrieval mechanism, indexing each step with 'contextual intent' cues like latent goals, action types, and salient entity attributes, enabling contextually compatible memory filtering.

Result: STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines by up to 35.6% on benchmarks such as CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, proving effectiveness in long trajectory scenarios.

Conclusion: Intent-aware memory systems like STITCH mitigate retrieval interference and improve robustness in goal-driven, long-horizon tasks, validating intention indexing for better reasoning.

Abstract: Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrieval cue, contextual intent, and retrieves history by matching the current step's intent. Contextual intent provides compact signals that disambiguate repeated mentions and reduce interference: (1) the current latent goal defining a thematic segment, (2) the action type, and (3) the salient entity types anchoring which attributes matter. During inference, STITCH filters and prioritizes memory snippets by intent compatibility, suppressing semantically similar but context-incompatible history.
  For evaluation, we introduce CAME-Bench, a benchmark for context-aware retrieval in realistic, dynamic, goal-oriented trajectories. Across CAME-Bench and LongMemEval, STITCH achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 35.6%, with the largest gains as trajectory length increases. Our analysis shows that intent indexing substantially reduces retrieval noise, supporting intent-aware memory for robust long-horizon reasoning.

*Changle Qu,Sunhao Dai,Hengyi Cai,Jun Xu,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MatchTIR introduces a framework to improve credit assignment for large language models (LLMs) using bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation, excelling in long-horizon, multi-turn tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods inadequately assign credit at the step-level in long-horizon, multi-turn tasks, struggling to distinguish effective from redundant or erroneous tool interactions.

Method: MatchTIR uses bipartite matching to assign fine-grained turn-level rewards based on predicted and ground-truth traces, alongside a dual-level advantage estimation combining turn-level and trajectory-level feedback.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks reveal that MatchTIR significantly outperforms existing models. Its 4B model surpasses many 8B models, particularly in complex multi-turn tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MatchTIR framework offers superior accuracy and efficiency for LLMs in challenging, tool-integrated reasoning tasks, showcasing the importance of fine-grained and dual-level credit assignment approaches.

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool calls from redundant or erroneous ones, particularly in long-horizon multi-turn scenarios. To address this, we propose MatchTIR, a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision via bipartite matching-based turn-level reward assignment and dual-level advantage estimation. Specifically, we formulate credit assignment as a bipartite matching problem between predicted and ground-truth traces, utilizing two assignment strategies to derive dense turn-level rewards. Furthermore, to balance local step precision with global task success, we introduce a dual-level advantage estimation scheme that integrates turn-level and trajectory-level signals, assigning distinct advantage values to individual interaction turns. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MatchTIR. Notably, our 4B model surpasses the majority of 8B competitors, particularly in long-horizon and multi-turn tasks.

Result: The pipeline successfully evades identity recognition systems, while achieving strong detection and analysis of adversarial patches (SSIM of 0.95).

Conclusion: The approach shows effectiveness in compromising facial biometrics and analyzing adversarial inputs, with potential applications in security testing and forensic investigations.

Abstract: This work presents an end-to-end pipeline for generating, refining, and evaluating adversarial patches to compromise facial biometric systems, with applications in forensic analysis and security testing. We utilize FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting an identity classifier and employ a diffusion model with reverse diffusion to enhance imperceptibility through Gaussian smoothing and adaptive brightness correction, thereby facilitating synthetic adversarial patch evasion. The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks. The pipeline evaluates changes in identity classification, captioning results, and vulnerabilities in facial identity verification and expression recognition under adversarial conditions. We further demonstrate effective detection and analysis of adversarial patches and adversarial samples using perceptual hashing and segmentation, achieving an SSIM of 0.95.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCF3D proposes a multimodal fusion framework for improving 3D object detection in autonomous driving by combining RGB camera and LiDAR sensor data. It leverages late and cascade fusion techniques to enhance performance, especially for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of effectively combining RGB camera and LiDAR sensor data for high-performance 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

Method: LCF3D uses a framework combining late fusion (filtering LiDAR False Positives) and cascade fusion (recovering missed objects using RGB detections) to improve detection accuracy.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LCF3D significantly improves detection for categories like pedestrians and cyclists in KITTI, and motorcycles/bicycles in nuScenes, benefiting domain generalization.

Conclusion: LCF3D proves effective in enhancing multimodal 3D object detection performance by addressing LiDAR inaccuracies and improving detection across varied sensor configurations during testing.

Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NanoSD introduces Pareto-optimal lightweight diffusion models derived from Stable Diffusion 1.5 for efficient deployment on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion 1.5 are computationally demanding, making them unsuitable for edge devices despite their generative potential.

Method: The paper proposes NanoSD, which combines network surgery, generative distillation, and co-optimization across the U-Net and VAE encoder-decoder to preserve generative priors while being hardware-efficient.

Result: NanoSD models offer distinct trade-offs in accuracy, latency, and size, achieving real-time inference on mobile-class NPUs and excelling in tasks like super-resolution, deblurring, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: NanoSD establishes itself as a general-purpose, lightweight diffusion model family, enabling superior performance and deployability on edge devices for real-time visual restoration.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.

*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Hanwen Liu,Xiangbo Zhang,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniHash, a dual-branch hashing framework, to balance retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hashing methods excel only in either seen or unseen category retrieval due to their reliance on a single training paradigm, lacking balance across both scenarios.

Method: UniHash employs a dual-branch framework—one using a center-based pointwise paradigm and the other a pairwise paradigm—along with a novel learning method using mutual learning loss and a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts module.

Result: UniHash outperforms state-of-the-art methods in seen and unseen image retrieval tasks, validated through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: The dual-branch UniHash framework achieves balanced generalization and discriminability across seen and unseen categories, providing a robust solution for modern image retrieval needs.

Abstract: Effective retrieval across both seen and unseen categories is crucial for modern image retrieval systems. Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.

*Po-han Li,Shenghui Chen,Ufuk Topcu,Sandeep Chinchali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ViSIL, an innovative metric for evaluating multimodal video summaries by quantifying the information loss via vision-language model inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to adequately evaluate multimodal summaries, as they cannot assess information coverage across modalities (e.g., text and keyframes).

Method: The authors propose an information-theoretic metric called Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) to measure the loss of video-related information in multimodal summaries using vision-language model inference.

Result: The ViSIL metric correlates strongly with human and vision-language model performance in Video Question Answering tasks. It also optimizes the trade-off between information loss and efficiency, achieving a 7% improvement in VQA accuracy compared to text-only summaries.

Conclusion: ViSIL provides a robust, unified framework for evaluating multimodal video summaries with structural discrepancies, enabling more efficient and accurate video summarization techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

*Anant Mehta,Xiyuan Wei,Xingyu Chen,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TuneCLIP introduces a self-supervised fine-tuning framework for improving CLIP models' general performance on various tasks without training from scratch on large-scale data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve existing CLIP models' general performance across tasks using self-supervised datasets, addressing the challenge of performance degradation with standard training protocols.

Method: TuneCLIP includes a two-stage fine-tuning approach: (1) a warm-up phase to recover optimization statistics, reducing cold-start bias, and (2) a fine-tuning phase with a novel contrastive loss to mitigate false negative pair penalization.

Result: TuneCLIP consistently boosts CLIP performance across architectures and scales, achieving notable gains like +2.5% on ImageNet and out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the DataComp benchmark.

Conclusion: TuneCLIP sets a new benchmark for efficient post-pretraining adaptation, making it an effective approach for enhancing CLIP models without costly retraining.

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

TL;DR: VibrantSR is a super-resolution model that estimates detailed canopy height models (CHMs) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, offering consistent monitoring while outperforming competing satellite-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a method for generating accurate CHMs from widely available Sentinel-2 imagery, overcoming the limitations of infrequent and irregular aerial data acquisition.

Method: The method involves a generative super-resolution framework (VibrantSR) that processes Sentinel-2 data to estimate high-resolution CHMs with increased accuracy.

Result: VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 4.39 m for canopy heights >= 2 m, performing better than other satellite-based benchmarks, though aerial-based results retain higher accuracy.

Conclusion: VibrantSR provides an operational solution for large-scale forest monitoring and carbon accounting using Sentinel-2 data, combining cost-efficiency with high accuracy for seasonal-to-annual analyses.

Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights >= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MedVL-SAM2, a unified model for 3D medical imaging tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in text and image understanding, segmentation, and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenges in combining fine-grained visual grounding and 3D spatial reasoning within a single unified framework for medical vision-language models (VLMs).

Method: The authors developed MedVL-SAM2, integrating image-level and pixel-level reasoning using a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module. It was pre-trained on large 3D CT image-text datasets, followed by joint optimization on segmentation and language tasks.

Result: The model achieved state-of-the-art performance in report generation, visual question answering, and multi-paradigm segmentation tasks, providing reliable 3D grounding and robust reasoning.

Conclusion: MedVL-SAM2 demonstrates that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be effectively unified in a single 3D medical VLM, offering significant advancements in multimodal medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

*Weili Nie,Julius Berner,Nanye Ma,Chao Liu,Saining Xie,Arash Vahdat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a framework for creating efficient video generation models by distilling video diffusion models into few-step lightweight generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models offer high-quality generation but are inefficient for real-time applications due to their multi-step sampling process.

Method: TMD matches multi-step denoising of diffusion models with few-step probability transitions, using a decomposition into a semantic main backbone and a lightweight flow head to achieve efficient distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on distilling large-scale text-to-video models demonstrate TMD achieves improved visual quality and speed trade-offs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TMD balances generation speed and visual quality effectively, outperforming prior approaches, and enables real-time video generation applications.

Abstract: Large video diffusion and flow models have achieved remarkable success in high-quality video generation, but their use in real-time interactive applications remains limited due to their inefficient multi-step sampling process. In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/tmd

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of degraded segmentation performance in autonomous driving under out-of-distribution scenarios, which affects downstream tasks like planning and decision-making.

Method: They propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport-driven framework that fuses RGB and surface normal data. It introduces a Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose environmental data into semantic anchors and uses an Optimal Transport-based fusion module to ensure robust segmentation by aligning features to these anchors.

Result: OT-Drive achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios (6.35% improvement over prior methods) and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfers (surpassing baselines by 13.99%), demonstrating superior performance even with limited training data.

Conclusion: OT-Drive significantly improves generalization in traversable area segmentation for unstructured environments, addressing OOD challenges with efficiency and practicality for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) lack capabilities in spatial relationship reasoning due to flattening 2D image structures. Alternative image encoder designs and 2D positional encodings enhance spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current VLMs in accurately reasoning about spatial relationships, which are crucial for applications like robotics and embodied AI.

Method: The paper explores using alternative image encoders and incorporating 2D positional encodings during model training to improve spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architectural adjustments enhance spatial reasoning across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating 2D structure awareness into VLM design is pivotal for improving their spatial reasoning, addressing critical gaps for AI fields requiring spatial grounding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework to improve reasoning segmentation by reducing overthinking and boosting segmentation accuracy via a two-stage process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reasoning segmentation overthink, generating verbose reasoning chains that hinder object localization.

Method: DR$^2$Seg uses a two-stage rollout strategy: first, it generates a self-contained description to specify the target object; second, it verifies the description by replacing the original query. Self-rewards are incorporated to enhance reasoning efficiency.

Result: The framework improves reasoning efficiency and segmentation performance across different multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and segmentation model scales.

Conclusion: DR$^2$Seg is effective in enhancing reasoning segmentation by combining goal-oriented reasoning with reduced redundancy, demonstrating consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, caused by high-dimensional multi-metric data, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance.

Method: The paper introduces a DW-DGAT model that employs a general data fusion strategy to merge diverse data types, a dual graph attention network to extract multi-level features, and a class weight mechanism with stable loss functions.

Result: The proposed DW-DGAT model achieves state-of-the-art results in experiments conducted on PPMI and ADNI datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in early disease diagnosis.

Conclusion: DW-DGAT significantly improves early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases through innovative methods of data fusion, feature extraction, and imbalance handling, providing robust and effective performance.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most prevalent and incurable neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) worldwide, for which early diagnosis is critical to delay their progression. However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance. Rigorous experiments, based on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzhermer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

Motivation: Despite advances in VideoLLMs, the community has neglected hallucination issues related to event relations, which are critical for understanding causal, temporal, and subevent connections in videos.

Method: The authors develop the VERHallu benchmark with tasks like relation classification and counterfactual question answering, and propose the Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy to improve frame-level attention for dense-event reasoning in VideoLLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art VideoLLMs were found to struggle with reasoning about dense-event relations, often defaulting to prior knowledge instead of utilizing frame-level cues. The proposed KFP strategy reduces such hallucinations without impacting inference speed.

Conclusion: The study underscores the significance of addressing event relation hallucination in VideoLLMs and provides a promising strategy with the KFP approach, improving reasoning while maintaining performance efficiency.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

*Giyeol Kim,Chanho Eom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiCo, a novel framework for Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID), enhancing cross-modal alignment using disentangled concept representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TIReID techniques struggle with modality gaps and fine-grained cross-modal correspondences, requiring improved methods for interpreting attributes like color and texture between text and image.

Method: DiCo uses a shared slot-based representation decomposed into concept blocks, facilitating disentangled cross-modal alignment of attributes while maintaining fine-grained part-level correspondence.

Result: Experiments on datasets CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate DiCo’s competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods and better interpretability for fine-grained person retrieval.

Conclusion: DiCo offers a hierarchically disentangled framework that effectively addresses challenges in TIReID, achieving strong retrieval accuracy while enhancing the interpretability of attribute-specific correspondences.

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

*Nick Truong,Pritam P. Karmokar,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow. It uses realistic ray-traced data and evaluates standard optical flow prediction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imaging faces challenges like wavelength light attenuation, suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and illumination issues, making accurate motion studies difficult. Event cameras could handle these but lacked proper datasets.

Method: The authors created a synthetic underwater dataset using physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences and converted videos to event streams using modern video-to-event pipelines. They paired this with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and motion data.

Result: They benchmarked current optical flow methods and provided insights into underwater light transport's impact on event formation and motion prediction.

Conclusion: A new dataset for event-based underwater motion study is established, enabling better development in underwater perception systems.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms. The source code and dataset for this project are publicly available at https://robotic-vision-lab.github.io/ueof.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance text-to-image generation by leveraging visual reasoning, underdeveloped despite success in video models across visual tasks.

Method: Develop CoF-T2I model with progressive visual refinement, using intermediate frames for explicit reasoning; create CoF-Evol-Instruct dataset for frame evolution.

Result: CoF-T2I achieves competitive performance: 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench, outperforming the baseline video model.

Conclusion: Video models hold promise for improving high-quality text-to-image generation through coherent frame-based reasoning.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RAG-3DSG, a method for improving open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph generation's accuracy and speed by mitigating aggregation noise and employing adaptive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from low accuracy and speed in generating 3DSGs due to challenges like constrained viewpoints and redundant surface density.

Method: RAG-3DSG utilizes re-shot guided uncertainty estimation, retrieval-augmented generation for low-uncertainty objects, and dynamic downsample-mapping for efficient cross-image aggregation.

Result: RAG-3DSG improves node captioning accuracy and reduces mapping time by two-thirds on the Replica dataset compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed RAG-3DSG approach enhances 3DSG generation by improving semantic representation accuracy and processing efficiency, benefiting downstream robotic tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

*Hyun Do Jung,Jungwon Choi,Hwiyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReaMIL, a multiple instance learning method for histopathology that achieves effective performance while producing compact evidence sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy in whole-slide histopathology by developing an evidence- and reasoning-aware method that selects compact, relevant evidence with minimal tiles without sacrificing performance.

Method: ReaMIL, which uses a selection head with a budgeted-sufficiency hinge loss to enforce true-class probabilities while maintaining a sparsity budget on selected tiles in multiple instance learning frameworks.

Result: ReaMIL achieves strong performance across datasets (e.g., AUC 0.983 on NSCLC) while ensuring compact evidence sets with metrics like MSK and AUKC for model evaluation.

Conclusion: ReaMIL integrates seamlessly with MIL training in histopathology, providing interpretable and efficient diagnostic models without requiring additional supervision.

Abstract: We introduce ReaMIL (Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware MIL), a multiple instance learning approach for whole-slide histopathology that adds a light selection head to a strong MIL backbone. The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept. The method requires no extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard MIL training, and naturally yields slide-level overlays. We report accuracy alongside MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

*Zhendong Wang,Lebin Zhou,Jingchuan Xiao,Rongduo Han,Nam Ling,Cihan Ruan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses 3D style transfer inspired by Post-Impressionist principles, focusing on geometric abstraction to enable authentic painterly effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing 3D style transfer methods that prioritize rigid geometry for texture projection, aiming to authentically replicate Post-Impressionist stylization by embracing geometric abstraction.

Method: The authors propose a novel mesh-free framework utilizing flow-guided geometric advection in 3D Gaussian Splatting. Directional flow fields derived from 2D artworks are propagated into 3D space to adjust Gaussian primitives and create expressive, flow-aligned brushstrokes.

Result: Their approach achieves expressive structural deformation guided by painterly motion while minimizing artifacts and introduces a novel evaluation framework recognizing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

Conclusion: The paper successfully operationalizes Post-Impressionist principles in 3D style transfer, demonstrating innovation in artistic geometry manipulation and evaluation methods for aesthetic authenticity.

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

*Amir Mallak,Erfan Aasi,Shiva Sreeram,Tsun-Hsuan Wang,Daniela Rus,Alaa Maalouf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS) to improve robustness and efficiency in autonomous driving by selectively masking patch descriptors during policy training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the redundancy in patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models, which causes overfitting and reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness.

Method: SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors for each frame, preserving spatial layout and providing stochastic yet coherent views of scenes for policy training.

Result: SPS achieves an average improvement of 6.2% and up to 20.4% in closed-loop simulations on OOD scenarios, while being 2.4x faster compared to SOTA. The learned policy also successfully transfers to real-world driving without tuning.

Conclusion: Adopting SPS improves policy robustness, generalization, and efficiency in end-to-end autonomous driving across diverse OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

*Mingzhuo Li,Guang Li,Linfeng Ye,Jiafeng Mao,Takahiro Ogawa,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Difficulty-Guided Sampling (DGS), a method to enhance dataset distillation by aligning it to downstream tasks, especially image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve dataset distillation methods by addressing the target gap between the distillation process and downstream tasks, as current methods lack task-specific insights.

Method: The authors propose DGS, a post-stage sampling module that uses difficulty as a characteristic of data. It creates a difficulty distribution to sample the final distilled set from existing methods' data pools and introduces Difficulty-Aware Guidance (DAG) for the generation process.

Result: Experiments across various settings prove DGS's effectiveness in improving dataset distillation and downstream task outcomes, evidenced by better model performance.

Conclusion: DGS shows potential for not only enhancing image classification but also broader downstream applications by integrating task-specific difficulty insights into the distillation process.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces V-Zero, a method enabling vision-language models to self-improve without human-labeled data by leveraging a Questioner and Solver architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation of large-scale datasets for multimodal learning is costly and time-consuming. The authors aim to develop a framework that enables self-improvement without human-annotated data.

Method: V-Zero uses a co-evolutionary framework with two roles: a Questioner that generates challenging questions and a Solver that improves by using pseudo-labels. Both are trained iteratively using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: V-Zero achieved performance gains in vision-language tasks without any human annotations, such as improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric tasks by +2.6.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that multimodal systems can achieve significant self-improvement using only unlabeled data, reducing dependency on human annotations. The framework holds potential for broader applications in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes InfoSculpt, a new framework for addressing Generalized Category Discovery tasks by leveraging information-theoretic principles to disentangle categorical signals and remove noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the limitation of existing GCD methods, which struggle to disentangle category-defining signals from instance-specific noise, crucial for handling open-world classification tasks.

Method: The paper uses the Information Bottleneck principle and introduces Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objectives at both category level and instance level to sculpt a disentangled representation space.

Result: Experiments conducted on 8 benchmarks validate that InfoSculpt effectively improves the discovery of new categories by producing robust and meaningful latent space representations.

Conclusion: By employing an information-theoretic approach, InfoSculpt offers a principled and robust method for GCD, addressing current limitations and improving real-world open-world classification tasks.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

Result: The framework achieves stable performance at 25fps and 480p resolution, with a low TTFF of 1.5 seconds, ensuring vivid and realistic behavioral control across various character styles.

Conclusion: FlowAct-R1 represents a significant advancement in humanoid video synthesis, providing real-time responsiveness, perceptual realism, and effective behavioral control for interactive applications.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to address challenges in extracting structured information from visually noisy, real-world math exam papers, a problem overlooked by existing benchmarks.

Method: They developed MathDoc, a realistic dataset with 3,609 curated math questions, including unrecognizable samples, and proposed an evaluation framework considering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and the ability to refuse illegible inputs.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art models show strong extraction results but reveal their failure in rejecting invalid or illegible inputs, leading to confident but incorrect outputs.

Conclusion: MathDoc serves as an essential benchmark for improving model reliability under noisy document settings, highlighting the need to enhance models' refusal capability for illegible inputs.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

### [161] [Enhancing Visual In-Context Learning by Multi-Faceted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10107)
*Wenwen Liao,Jianbo Yu,Yuansong Wang,Qingchao Jiang,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) that utilizes multi-combination collaborative fusion to enhance model performance compared to traditional single-prompt or straightforward multi-prompt fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches in VICL rely on a single best visual prompt or simple merging of top-K prompts, which often limits the model's ability to fully utilize the contextual richness and variety in the information. This creates a need for a method that better captures and integrates this diversity for more effective reasoning.

Method: The framework introduces multi-combination collaborative fusion, where three contextual representation branches are generated by combining different top-quality prompts. These are processed through a novel MULTI-VQGAN architecture that jointly interprets information from these multiple sources.

Result: Experiments across tasks such as foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrated that the proposed method leads to stronger generalization across tasks, more effective contextual fusion, and more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach significantly advances VICL by effectively utilizing multiple diverse prompts through collaborative fusion rather than collapsing them into a single signal. This method demonstrates superior performance and generalization across visual tasks.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

Result: Experiments on tasks like segmentation, detection, and colorization showcase superior performance and cross-task generalization of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances inpainting models' effectiveness in adapting to diverse visual tasks and sets a new benchmark in VICL effectiveness.

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

### [163] [VQ-Seg: Vector-Quantized Token Perturbation for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10124)
*Sicheng Yang,Zhaohu Xing,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VQ-Seg, a new semi-supervised medical image segmentation method using vector quantization instead of dropout for feature space perturbation, achieving superior results in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of dropout-based feature perturbation methods, such as sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Method: Propose VQ-Seg, which uses a Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) to shuffle feature space indices for regularization, along with a dual-branch architecture and Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to mitigate information loss and integrate foundation model guidance.

Result: Experiments on a large Lung Cancer dataset and public benchmarks showed VQ-Seg outperformed current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: VQ-Seg is a robust and controllable semi-supervised segmentation method, replacing dropout with vector quantization and demonstrating strong performance on medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

*Linquan Wu,Tianxiang Jiang,Yifei Dong,Haoyu Yang,Fengji Zhang,Shichaang Meng,Ai Xuan,Linqi Song,Jacky Keung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaViT is a framework designed to address the perception gap in multimodal latent reasoning by aligning latent visual thoughts and enhancing visual grounding, achieving significant performance improvements compared to other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a Perception Gap in multimodal reasoning processes, where student models rely on language priors due to divergent visual attention dynamics, leading to poor visual grounding and ineffective learning.

Method: The LaViT framework aligns latent visual thoughts instead of static embeddings. It employs autoregressive reconstruction of visual semantics and attention trajectories, along with a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning.

Result: LaViT demonstrates significant improvements in visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% performance gains in complex reasoning tasks. A compact 3B model trained with LaViT even outperforms larger open-source and proprietary models, including GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Aligning latent visual thoughts and preventing shortcut learning are crucial to bridging the perception gap in multimodal reasoning, enabling smaller models to reach and surpass the performance of larger counterparts.

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

### [165] [Advancing Adaptive Multi-Stage Video Anomaly Reasoning: A Benchmark Dataset and Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10165)
*Chao Huang,Benfeng Wang,Wei Wang,Jie Wen,Li Shen,Wenqi Ren,Yong Xu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the task of Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), moving beyond simple anomaly detection to structured, multi-stage reasoning, supported by a large new dataset and proposing an enhanced VAR model for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U) lack structured reasoning, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation capabilities.

Method: To address this, a new VAR task is defined and complemented with a dataset of 8,641 videos (50,000+ samples) with annotations based on a structured PerCoAct-CoT framework. Additionally, the authors introduce Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization and the Vad-R1-Plus model for enhanced VAR.

Result: Proposed VAR task and benchmarks improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, with the Vad-R1-Plus model surpassing both open-source and proprietary baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that structured reasoning, adaptive decision-making, and risk awareness significantly advance video anomaly understanding using MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

### [166] [From Physical Degradation Models to Task-Aware All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10192)
*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Xichen Xu,Xingjian Wang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OPIR, a framework for all-in-one image restoration that predicts an inverse degradation operator to improve efficiency and adaptivity across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors want to address the complexity and inefficiency of existing image restoration methods that use additional learning modules, which affect real-time performance.

Method: The proposed framework, OPIR, uses a two-stage process. In the first stage, it predicts an inverse degradation operator to restore the image and generates an uncertainty perception map to guide refinement. In the second stage, it refines the restoration using the same inverse operator prediction network.

Result: Experimental validation shows that OPIR outperforms other models in all-in-one restoration and remains competitive in task-specific restoration, all while being efficient.

Conclusion: OPIR demonstrates that a tightly integrated, operator-based approach can achieve superior and efficient image restoration across multiple tasks, offering a viable solution to the complexities of previous methods.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELITE introduces an efficient system for synthesizing high-fidelity head avatars from monocular videos, combining 3D and 2D data priors with a novel test-time adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing avatar synthesis methods, which either struggle to generalize in-the-wild (3D prior methods) or are computationally heavy and prone to hallucinations (2D prior methods).

Method: A system combining a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model for fast initialization and a rendering-guided, single-step diffusion enhancer for test-time generative adaptation, improving generalization and computational efficiency.

Result: ELITE achieves visually superior avatars with strong generalization to challenging expressions and a remarkable 60x faster synthesis compared to the 2D generative prior approach.

Conclusion: The integration of complementary 3D and 2D priors, alongside efficient test-time adaptation, enables ELITE to overcome prior synthesis challenges while maintaining speed and quality.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

*Dong-Yu Chen,Yixin Guo,Shuojin Yang,Tai-Jiang Mu,Shi-Min Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthDirector introduces a novel framework to achieve precise camera control in video generation by using depth-guided input, tackling challenges like subject inconsistency and degraded quality seen in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise camera trajectory control in video generation while maintaining dynamic scene consistency and high-quality output. Existing methods struggle with subject inconsistency and fail to utilize video diffusion models' full 3D potential.

Method: It proposes DepthDirector, which uses depth videos from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance. The key innovation is the View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism and a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter, which ensures effective use of pre-trained video diffusion models.

Result: DepthDirector outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of camera controllability and visual quality. A new large-scale dataset, MultiCam-WarpData, is also introduced, enhancing evaluation capabilities for camera-controlled video generation.

Conclusion: DepthDirector effectively bridges the gap between precise camera control and high-quality, consistent video generation by leveraging 3D depth-based guidance and advanced training adaptation, offering state-of-the-art performance in the domain.

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

### [170] [Attend to what I say: Highlighting relevant content on slides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10244)
*Megha Mariam K M,C. V. Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to automatically highlight relevant regions in presentation slides based on the speaker's narrative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the disconnect between spoken content and visual elements in slides, reducing audience cognitive strain in fast-paced presentations.

Method: The method involves analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in slides.

Result: The approach aims to enhance synchronization between auditory and visual elements in presentations, improving comprehension.

Conclusion: This highlights the importance of multimedia document analysis for seamless understanding in content-heavy videos, supporting educational and conference contexts.

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DanQing, a high-quality Chinese image-text dataset developed to advance Chinese vision-language pre-training models, addressing the lack of such data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of robust, high-quality Chinese image-text data has hindered the development of vision-language pretraining for Chinese models, unlike English counterparts.

Method: A rigorous pipeline is created to curate a high-quality dataset, DanQing, from Common Crawl, focusing on web data from 2024-2025 to capture updated semantic trends.

Result: Models trained on DanQing demonstrate better performance in Chinese downstream tasks like zero-shot classification, retrieval, and LMM evaluations compared to other datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DanQing dataset bridges the gap in Chinese vision-language pre-training data, significantly improving tasks' performance and will be open-sourced to encourage further research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

*Peng-Fei Zhang,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a universal attack framework for Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, addressing limitations of existing attacks. It refines adversarial perturbations and achieves better multimodal alignment disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing sample-specific adversarial attacks, which are computationally intensive and inefficient for large datasets or new scenarios.

Method: Introduces the Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA) framework involving disentangled visual perturbations, ScMix augmentation strategy to diversify contexts, optimization path improvement with historical and predicted gradients, and global influential word identification for text modality.

Result: HRA demonstrates superior effectiveness in disrupting cross-modal alignment and performance of VLP models across multiple tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HRA method advances universal multimodal adversarial attacks, proving efficient and effective against VLP models without reliance on sample-specific strategies.

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

TL;DR: ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant, enables unified audio, vision, and text processing in streaming contexts, excelling in both proactive and reactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing multimodal models, such as incomplete modality support and lack of proactive monitoring, particularly in streaming audio-video understanding.

Method: ROMA processes synchronized multimodal units, aligns dense audio and discrete video frames, incorporates a lightweight speak head for decision-making, and is trained using a specialized streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum.

Result: ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in proactive tasks and competitive performance in reactive tasks across 12 benchmarking scenarios, establishing its ability for real-time, omni-multimodal functionality.

Conclusion: ROMA successfully addresses the challenges in streaming multimodal understanding, offering a robust model for real-time unified reactive and proactive interactions.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

*Yiming Zhang,Weibo Qin,Yuntian Liu,Feng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW), a method to generate imperceptible adversarial examples for SAR-ATR systems, significantly undermining their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR-ATR systems often rely on background regions and are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can degrade their robustness. Current attacks visually distort the image, reducing stealthiness.

Method: The authors propose SRAW, which uses optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets, selectively targeting foreground and background regions to create inconspicuous adversarial examples.

Result: SRAW effectively reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and surpasses existing attack methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Conclusion: SRAW presents a highly effective, stealthy adversarial attack that highlights vulnerabilities in SAR-ATR models. This emphasizes the need for improved defense mechanisms in such systems.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'think-then-generate' (T2G) paradigm where text-to-image models leverage language model reasoning to rewrite user prompts for more aligned and coherent image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models fail to utilize the reasoning capabilities of large language models, leading to purely literal text-to-image mappings.

Method: The paper employs a 'think-then-generate' paradigm, involving supervised fine-tuning to rewrite text prompts using language model reasoning, followed by co-optimization of the text encoder and diffusion backbone using image-grounded rewards.

Result: The proposed method achieves significant improvements in factual accuracy, semantic alignment, and visual quality in image generation, reaching a 0.79 WISE score, close to GPT-4.

Conclusion: This approach represents a step towards integrating reasoning and creativity into text-to-image models, bridging reasoning, expression, and demonstration abilities for unified performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes neural networks for imaging inverse problems using a theoretical approach called Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE) and demonstrates its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks show empirical success in imaging inverse problems but lack theoretical understanding, often regarded as 'black boxes'.

Method: Utilizes MMSE estimator with functional constraints reflecting CNN inductive biases like translation equivariance and locality, termed LE-MMSE, and validates through numerical experiments.

Result: The LE-MMSE matches the output of neural networks across various imaging inverse problems and architectures with high PSNR values (~25dB). Additionally, insights on the differences in estimators, dataset density, and other influential factors are provided.

Conclusion: LE-MMSE provides a theoretical understanding of neural networks utilized in imaging inverse problems while aligning closely with empirical results.

Abstract: Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to solve imaging inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous applications. However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \emph{physics-aware} and \emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address structural anomalies and generative artifacts in text-guided human pose editing and to overcome limitations in existing evaluation metrics that lack fine-grained pose-specific analysis.

Method: The authors developed HPE-Bench, a benchmark with standardized samples and multi-dimensional quality scoring. They also proposed a framework using layer-selective multimodal large language models with contrastive LoRA tuning and layer sensitivity analysis to enhance pose evaluation.

Result: Their framework outperforms existing models in both detecting authenticity and performing multi-dimensional quality regression.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and framework provide effective solutions to improve the precision and reliability of evaluating text-guided human pose editing.

Abstract: Text-guided human pose editing has gained significant traction in AIGC applications. However,it remains plagued by structural anomalies and generative artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics often isolate authenticity detection from quality assessment, failing to provide fine-grained insights into pose-specific inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

*Yichong Xia,Yimin Zhou,Jinpeng Wang,Bin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffCR is a new approach that significantly enhances diffusion-based image compression in terms of speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address slow sampling and inefficient bit allocation in current diffusion-based image compression methods.

Method: The paper introduces DiffCR framework, incorporating Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) and Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA), alongside a lightweight consistency estimator for faster decoding.

Result: DiffCR achieves 27.2% BD-rate savings in LPIPS, 65.1% BD-rate savings in PSNR, and a 10x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DiffCR significantly boosts compression efficiency and image reconstruction quality without requiring changes to the backbone diffusion model.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VIST2, a new vision-language model achieving efficient global context compression for OCR tasks, showing enhanced speed and reduced memory and computation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in previous OCR compression methods, particularly partial compression that fails during inference.

Method: The authors propose a novel Transformer interleaving textual and visual tokens, utilizing sketch-based visual encoding, and train it in staged approaches including curriculum-scheduled pretraining and instruction tuning.

Result: VIST2 achieves 4× compression ratio, significantly faster generation speeds, 77% memory reduction, and a 74% reduction in computational complexity (FLOPS).

Conclusion: The proposed VIST2 model ensures efficient token reduction in prefilling and inference stages, demonstrating its promising potential for long writing tasks with high-speed performance and minimal memory usage.

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

TL;DR: The paper aims to improve survival prediction in NSCLC by introducing a multimodal framework that handles heterogeneous data and addresses missing modalities effectively, achieving superior performance compared to traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study seeks to address the challenges of accurate survival prediction in NSCLC, specifically the limitation of small cohorts and the presence of missing modalities in multimodal data.

Method: The authors present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that uses Foundation Models for feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy. This approach facilitates an intermediate fusion of CT, histopathology, and clinical data.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms unimodal baselines and fusion strategies. The strongest performance was observed with the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities, achieving a 73.30 C-index.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework is robust to missing data, eliminates the need for aggressive imputation, and effectively utilizes available data, enhancing survival prediction in NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lunar-G2R, a framework to predict spatially varying BRDF parameters for lunar surfaces directly from elevation data, improving photometric realism without complex setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and spatially varying reflectance estimation is essential for realistic rendering and navigation on planetary surfaces like lunar regolith, yet existing methods rely on simplified models that can't capture local variations and limit realism.

Method: The authors propose Lunar-G2R, a U-Net based learning framework leveraging differentiable rendering to predict reflectance from a digital elevation model (DEM) and comparing synthetic and real images to minimize errors.

Result: Lunar-G2R improves photometric accuracy by 38% over the baseline on the Tycho crater's geographically distinct region, achieving better PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual similarity.

Conclusion: Lunar-G2R is the first model to infer spatially varying reflectance directly from terrain geometry, offering significant advancements in photorealistic rendering of lunar surfaces.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the segmentation of socially defined urban entities from satellite imagery, an area where existing models struggle compared to segmenting physical attributes.

Method: The authors created a dataset (SocioSeg) of satellite imagery and social semantic labels, and proposed a novel vision-language reasoning framework (SocioReasoner) integrating cross-modal recognition, multi-stage reasoning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The experiments show improved performance over existing models and strong zero-shot generalization capabilities for socio-semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: SocioReasoner and SocioSeg enable significant advancements in identifying social semantic entities, with useful resources freely available for further development and applications.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a strategy called MERGETUNE, enabling restoration of pre-trained knowledge in fine-tuned vision-language models like CLIP without additional parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs like CLIP leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. The paper aims to recover the lost pretrained knowledge after adaptation.

Method: They propose MERGETUNE, a model-agnostic continued fine-tuning strategy guided by linear mode connectivity, which restores pretrained knowledge by continuing fine-tuning under a tailored loss landscape geometry. The method avoids data replay using a second-order surrogate.

Result: MERGETUNE improves generalization by +5.6% (harmonic mean) on evaluations and achieves state-of-the-art results in robust fine-tuning evaluations, even surpassing ensemble baselines and CLIP on specific datasets.

Conclusion: MERGETUNE provides an effective way to restore pretrained knowledge and enhance fine-tuned VLMs' performance without adding parameters or requiring architectural changes.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model.

Result: SatMap improves HD map accuracy significantly, with a 34.8% mAP improvement over camera-only methods and an 8.5% mAP improvement over camera-LiDAR fusion, especially in long-range and adverse weather scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating satellite maps into HD map construction enhances autonomous driving pipeline capabilities under challenging conditions like occlusion and adverse weather, making SatMap an effective solution.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map.

Motivation: Create scalable, automated solutions for accurate 3D localization and asset digitization from sparse imagery.

Method: Uses LoRA fine-tuning, spatial-attention matching, and geometry-guided refinement along with Vision-Language Models.

Result: Enhanced identification accuracy and reduced localization errors in experiments.

Conclusion: SVII-3D improves infrastructure digitization, enabling cost-effective intelligent maintenance using a unified framework.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

TL;DR: This paper explores enhancing visibility and machine-readability of gauge images in hazy and smoky conditions using deep learning models, employing FFA-Net and AECR-Net architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address visibility reduction in gauge images caused by hazy and smoky environments, a critical issue in infrastructure monitoring and emergency response.

Method: Deep learning models (FFA-Net and AECR-Net) were applied to enhance gauge image visibility. A synthetic dataset of over 14,000 images (generated using Unreal Engine) was created for training, validation, and testing.

Result: For the synthetic haze dataset, high SSIM (0.98) and PSNR (~43 dB) results were achieved, with AECR-Net outperforming FFA-Net. Results on the synthetic smoke dataset were less effective due to image complexities.

Conclusion: Deep learning techniques significantly improve gauge image quality in adverse conditions, especially in haze, though challenges remain in addressing dense and inhomogeneous smoke.

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

Motivation: The study aims to address the challenge of general-purpose models failing to effectively capture fine-grained attributes and adhere to engineering standards for urban infrastructure monitoring.

Method: The authors propose a domain-adapted approach, combining open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO, LoRA-based adaptation of Qwen-VL, and a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module for knowledge-grounded reasoning.

Result: The framework, evaluated on a new urban roadside scene dataset, achieved a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively transforms VLMs into specialized tools for intelligent infrastructure analysis, demonstrating promising applications for smart city management.

Abstract: Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

Motivation: Address the limitations of current video generative models that often generate content violating basic physics principles due to insufficient inference strategies.

Method: Improves video generation physics plausibility using WMReward, which leverages a latent world model as a reward mechanism to guide denoising trajectories during inference.

Result: Substantial improvement in physics plausibility across various generation settings, validated by human preference studies. Achieved first place in ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge with a score of 62.64%, outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates that latent world models can significantly enhance the physics plausibility of video generation, providing a scalable test-time compute strategy applicable across multiple settings.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

Conclusion: DeepUrban significantly boosts prediction and planning performance, addressing gaps in autonomous driving benchmarks, especially in dense urban settings.

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

### [192] [Jordan-Segmentable Masks: A Topology-Aware definition for characterizing Binary Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10577)
*Serena Grazia De Benedictis,Amedeo Altavilla,Nicoletta Del Buono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a topology-aware evaluation framework for segmentation masks, based on the Jordan Curve Theorem and digital topology methods, to assess structural coherence and topological correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional evaluation metrics fail to accurately assess the structural and topological integrity of image segmentation, especially in applications where small boundary errors lead to significant issues, such as in medical imaging.

Method: The authors propose a new metric inspired by the Jordan Curve Theorem that assesses segmentation masks using digital topology and homology theory. They define 'Jordan-segmentatable masks' and validate them via Betti numbers and other topological properties.

Result: The proposed framework rigorously assesses the structural coherence of segmentation masks, offering a clear alternative to traditional pixel-wise or region-based evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: This work provides a topology-aware and mathematically rigorous method for segmentation evaluation, which is especially useful for ensuring topological correctness in critical applications.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a white-box adversarial attack on computer vision models using SHAP values, showing higher effectiveness compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore vulnerabilities in deep learning models against adversarial attacks, especially imperceptible ones, using SHAP values.

Method: Utilizes SHAP values to assess input significance and perform adversarial attacks, compared to Fast Gradient Sign Method.

Result: Evidence indicates SHAP attacks are more effective and robust in misclassification, especially with gradient hiding.

Conclusion: SHAP-based attacks pose a significant threat by compromising model performance and evading human detection.

Abstract: The paper introduces a white-box attack on computer vision models using SHAP values. It demonstrates how adversarial evasion attacks can compromise the performance of deep learning models by reducing output confidence or inducing misclassifications. Such attacks are particularly insidious as they can deceive the perception of an algorithm while eluding human perception due to their imperceptibility to the human eye. The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage. A comparison is drawn between the SHAP attack and the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method. We find evidence that SHAP attacks are more robust in generating misclassifications particularly in gradient hiding scenarios.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Action100M, a dataset containing 1.2M instructional videos to enable advanced video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine intelligence in understanding physical actions and broaden video datasets for this purpose.

Method: Developed Action100M via an automated pipeline including temporal segmentation, frame and segment captions, and structured annotation using reasoning models and multi-round refinement.

Result: Training on Action100M enhanced data-scaling and achieved strong zero-shot action recognition performance.

Conclusion: Action100M is a major step forward for scalable research in video understanding and modeling the physical world.

Abstract: Inferring physical actions from visual observations is a fundamental capability for advancing machine intelligence in the physical world. Achieving this requires large-scale, open-vocabulary video action datasets that span broad domains. We introduce Action100M, a large-scale dataset constructed from 1.2M Internet instructional videos (14.6 years of duration), yielding O(100 million) temporally localized segments with open-vocabulary action supervision and rich captions. Action100M is generated by a fully automated pipeline that (i) performs hierarchical temporal segmentation using V-JEPA 2 embeddings, (ii) produces multi-level frame and segment captions organized as a Tree-of-Captions, and (iii) aggregates evidence with a reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) under a multi-round Self-Refine procedure to output structured annotations (brief/detailed action, actor, brief/detailed caption). Training VL-JEPA on Action100M demonstrates consistent data-scaling improvements and strong zero-shot performance across diverse action recognition benchmarks, establishing Action100M as a new foundation for scalable research in video understanding and world modeling.

*Peng Chen,Xiaobao Wei,Yi Yang,Naiming Yao,Hui Chen,Feng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSATalker introduces a framework for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation using 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling efficient multi-turn conversational avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to balance realism, computational efficiency, and social awareness in talking head generation, especially for multi-turn and interpersonal scenarios.

Method: RSATalker uses mesh-based 3D facial motion driven by speech, binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets for rendering, and employs a socially-aware module to encode interpersonal dynamics via high-level embeddings and a three-stage training process.

Result: The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in realism and social-awareness for talking head generation, supported by experiments on a custom RSATalker dataset.

Conclusion: RSATalker successfully combines 3DGS with socially-aware modeling for efficient, realistic, and contextually-aware talking head generation, addressing key challenges in VR conversational environments.

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Molmo2, a new family of open-source video-language models (VLMs), achieves state-of-the-art performance in video grounding and surpasses even proprietary models on specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible open-source tools and datasets needed for advancing video-language models and enabling open-source progress in grounding tasks.

Method: Molmo2 introduces 9 new datasets for training and fine-tuning, uses a novel packing and message-tree encoding scheme, applies bi-directional attention on vision tokens, and implements a token-weighting strategy to enhance performance.

Result: Molmo2 exhibits excellent performance on video grounding, outpacing open-source and proprietary models in metrics like accuracy and F1 on tasks such as video counting, pointing, and tracking.

Conclusion: Molmo2 offers transformative advancements in open-source VLMs, especially for grounding tasks, providing accessible tools and data that enable progress in video-language understanding.

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).

*Chengfeng Zhao,Jiazhi Shu,Yubo Zhao,Tianyu Huang,Jiahao Lu,Zekai Gu,Chengwei Ren,Zhiyang Dou,Qing Shuai,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoMoVi, a framework for synchronized generation of 3D human motions and 2D videos, relying on coupled video diffusion models and a curated dataset for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generation of realistic 3D human motions and 2D human videos is interdependent, as 3D motions ensure structural plausibility, and video models offer generalization, demanding a combined generation process.

Method: The authors propose CoMoVi, a dual-branch video diffusion model leveraging a new 2D human motion representation, mutual feature interaction, and 3D-2D cross attentions, trained on a new CoMoVi Dataset with diverse annotations.

Result: The experiments show that CoMoVi effectively generates high-quality 3D human motions and videos in a synchronized manner, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: CoMoVi successfully couples the generation of 3D motions and videos, providing a unified and efficient framework for advancing human video and motion synthesis tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

TL;DR: CURVE introduces a benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning, addressing biases in existing benchmarks focused on western-centric and English-language data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome existing biases in video reasoning benchmarks by providing a more culturally and linguistically diverse evaluation dataset.

Method: CURVE consists of region-specific cultural videos with human-generated annotations, complex questions, and multi-step reasoning in native languages. Reasoning traces are used to build evidence-based graphs to improve error detection in reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art video language models perform significantly lower than human accuracy on the CURVE benchmark, with errors mainly linked to the visual perception of cultural elements.

Conclusion: CURVE highlights the limitations of current video language models in understanding multicultural contexts and provides a pathway for improving evaluation and modeling of diverse cultural content.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

TL;DR: The paper introduces a groundbreaking multimodal dataset of NEON's ground beetle specimens digitized for broader ecological use, incorporating automated trait extraction with AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to expand ecological trait databases beyond vertebrates and plants to include invertebrates like ground beetles for deeper biodiversity analysis.

Method: Digitization of 13,200 NEON ground beetle specimens and implementation of AI-based automated computational trait extraction with high accuracy.

Result: The dataset validated AI-driven trait extraction (elytra measurements) with sub-millimeter precision across 30 different sites in the US and Hawaii.

Conclusion: This effort advances biodiversity monitoring and conservation through removal of barriers in ground beetle research, enabling widespread ecological and computational studies.

Abstract: Despite the ecological significance of invertebrates, global trait databases remain heavily biased toward vertebrates and plants, limiting comprehensive ecological analyses of high-diversity groups like ground beetles. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis. The dataset includes digitally measured elytra length and width of each specimen, establishing a foundation for automated trait extraction using AI. Validated against manual measurements, our digital trait extraction achieves sub-millimeter precision, ensuring reliability for ecological and computational studies. By addressing invertebrate under-representation in trait databases, this work supports AI-driven tools for automated species identification and trait-based research, fostering advancements in biodiversity monitoring and conservation.

*Cheng Chen,Yuyu Guo,Pengpeng Zeng,Jingkuan Song,Peng Di,Hang Yu,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a method for enhancing Vision-Language Models by overcoming limitations in their current visual feature integration approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models suffer from a bottleneck that prevents effective alignment between vision encoders and large language models, hindering their reasoning abilities.

Method: The authors propose CLI, which dynamically bridges vision and language modalities via an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module for feature harmonization and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism for selective visual information injection.

Result: The integration of CLI into existing models (e.g., LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5) improved performance across 18 benchmarks, demonstrating its scalability and relevance.

Conclusion: CLI enhances multimodal models by granting language models dynamic and selective access to hierarchical visual information, unlocking deeper multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

*Tal Reiss,Daniel Winter,Matan Cohen,Alex Rav-Acha,Yael Pritch,Ariel Shamir,Yedid Hoshen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Alterbute is a diffusion-based method for editing intrinsic attributes of objects in images while maintaining identity and scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for attribute editing often either fail to preserve object identity or impose overly restrictive guidelines, limiting intrinsic variations.

Method: The method involves a relaxed training objective to edit attributes while preserving identity using identity reference images, textual prompts, background image, and object masks. At inference, extrinsic changes are restricted using the original context. Visual Named Entities (VNEs) are also introduced for fine-grained identity categorization and supervision using vision-language models.

Result: Alterbute achieves superior performance in identity-preserving intrinsic attribute editing compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Alterbute provides a scalable and effective framework for editing intrinsic object attributes while maintaining identity, offering advancements over prior approaches.

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

*Xuweiyi Chen,Wentao Zhou,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildRayZer introduces a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments addressing challenges such as ghosting and hallucination by revealing transient regions and focusing on rigid structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments cause existing static NVS models to fail due to inconsistent multi-view data, leading to errors like ghosting and hallucinated geometry.

Method: WildRayZer uses a camera-only static renderer to explain rigid structures and identifies transient regions via residuals. This enables pseudo motion masks and a motion estimator to focus supervision on background completion.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline methods in transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality, validated on a new large-scale real-world dynamic dataset, D-RE10K, and its benchmark D-RE10K-iPhone.

Conclusion: WildRayZer is effective at handling dynamic environments with self-supervised NVS and shows significant improvements over baseline methodologies.

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

TL;DR: The paper surveys Federated Unlearning (FUL), which extends Machine Unlearning concepts to Federated Learning (FL). It focuses on efficiently addressing data deletion requests and highlights frameworks, applications, and open challenges in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is based on the proliferation of privacy-sensitive applications, the need for compliance with regulations such as RTBF, and the gap in Federated Learning's ability to support data deletion requests through Federated Unlearning.

Method: The method involves a comprehensive survey of FUL fundamentals, frameworks to address its implementation challenges like communication costs, resource allocation, and security/privacy. Applications and open challenges in the domain are also discussed.

Result: The paper provides a consolidated review of FUL, identifying main research frameworks, applications, and mapping key challenges to facilitate further development of trustworthy federated systems.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a vital reference for advancing Federated Learning, enabling systems that are privacy-compliant, user-centric, and ready to meet regulatory demands.

Abstract: The proliferation of connected devices and privacy-sensitive applications has accelerated the adoption of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. While FL addresses data locality and privacy concerns, it does not inherently support data deletion requests that are increasingly mandated by regulations such as the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). In centralized learning, this challenge has been studied under the concept of Machine Unlearning (MU), that focuses on efficiently removing the influence of specific data samples or clients from trained models. Extending this notion to federated settings has given rise to Federated Unlearning (FUL), a new research area concerned with eliminating the contributions of individual clients or data subsets from the global FL model in a distributed and heterogeneous environment. In this survey, we first introduce the fundamentals of FUL. Then, we review the FUL frameworks that are proposed to address the three main implementation challenges, i.e., communication cost, resource allocation as well as security and privacy. Furthermore, we discuss applications of FUL in the modern distributed computer networks. We also highlight the open challenges and future research opportunities. By consolidating existing knowledge and mapping open problems, this survey aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance FL to build trustworthy, regulation-compliant and user-centric federated systems.

*Ziting Zhang,Kai Wan,Minquan Cheng,Shuo Shao,Giuseppe Caire*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper investigates distributed linearly separable computation in heterogeneous systems, proposing schemes to balance computation and communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of efficiently calculating linearly separable functions across distributed datasets with arbitrary and heterogeneous data assignment.

Method: A universal computing scheme and converse bound are proposed to analyze the tradeoff between computable dimension and communication cost, addressing both integer and fractional communication cases.

Result: The computing scheme and converse bounds align in specific parameter settings, providing solutions for heterogeneous data assignments.

Conclusion: This study advances understanding of distributed computation efficiency under arbitrary heterogeneous data setups, providing adaptable schemes and foundational insights.

Abstract: Distributed linearly separable computation is a fundamental problem in large-scale distributed systems, requiring the computation of linearly separable functions over different datasets across distributed workers. This paper studies a heterogeneous distributed linearly separable computation problem, including one master and N distributed workers. The linearly separable task function involves Kc linear combinations of K messages, where each message is a function of one dataset. Distinguished from the existing homogeneous settings that assume each worker holds the same number of datasets, where the data assignment is carefully designed and controlled by the data center (e.g., the cyclic assignment), we consider a more general setting with arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment across workers, where `arbitrary' means that the data assignment is given in advance and `heterogeneous' means that the workers may hold different numbers of datasets. Our objective is to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the computable dimension of the task function and the communication cost under arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment. Under the constraint of integer communication costs, for arbitrary heterogeneous data assignment, we propose a universal computing scheme and a universal converse bound by characterizing the structure of data assignment, where they coincide under some parameter regimes. We then extend the proposed computing scheme and converse bound to the case of fractional communication costs.

### [205] [Mitigating GIL Bottlenecks in Edge AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10582)
*Mridankan Mandal,Smit Sanjay Shende*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses the runtime optimization issues of deploying Python-based AI on resource-constrained edge devices, focusing on the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) bottlenecks and providing a better solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the runtime efficiency of Python-based AI agents on edge devices, overcoming the limitations caused by GIL and thread-scaling issues while minimizing resource overhead.

Method: The authors developed a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system employing a Blocking Ratio metric (β) to distinguish genuine I/O wait from GIL contention, coupled with a library-based solution for performance optimization.

Result: Their solution achieved 96.5% optimal performance, outperformed existing models like multiprocessing and asyncio, and achieved 93.9% efficiency across various edge AI workloads. Tests with GIL-free Python verified the validity of their method even for single-core devices.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective and practical optimization for Python-based AI systems on resource-constrained edge devices, addressing both GIL and no-GIL environments effectively.

Abstract: Deploying Python based AI agents on resource-constrained edge devices presents a runtime optimization challenge: high thread counts are needed to mask I/O latency, yet Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) serializes execution. We demonstrate that naive thread-pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": >= 20% throughput degradation at overprovisioned thread counts (N >= 512) on edge-representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system using a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) that distinguishes genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (blocked by CPU-bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This provides practical optimization for edge AI systems.

*Evangelos Kolyvas,Alexandros Antonov,Spyros Voulgaris*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper addresses blockchain transaction throughput limitations by introducing "SCRamble," a protocol aiming to reduce block dissemination time and enhance system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve blockchain transaction throughput and system security by addressing network latency issues during block propagation.

Method: Proposes SCRamble, a protocol utilizing innovative link selection strategies combining block arrival time scoring and latency considerations.

Result: SCRamble demonstrates significant reductions in block dissemination time within blockchain networks.

Conclusion: SCRamble effectively enhances blockchain performance by improving transaction rates and reducing security risks such as forks.

Abstract: Despite being under development for over 15 years, transaction throughput remains one of the key challenges confronting blockchains, which typically has a cap of a limited number of transactions per second. A fundamental factor limiting this metric is the network latency associated with the block propagation throughout of the underlying peer-to-peer network, typically formed through random connections. Accelerating the dissemination of blocks not only improves transaction rates, but also enhances system security by reducing the probability of forks. This paper introduces SCRamble: a decentralized protocol that significantly reduces block dissemination time in blockchain networks. SCRamble's effectiveness is attributed to its innovative link selection strategy, which integrates two heuristics: a scoring mechanism that assesses block arrival times from neighboring peers, and a second heuristic that takes network latency into account.

### [207] [Social Determinants of Health Prediction for ICD-9 Code with Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09709)
*Sharim Khan,Paul Landes,Adam Cross,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on classifying ICD-9 codes related to Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) using the MIMIC-III dataset and achieves an F1 score of 89%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) significantly impact patient outcomes yet are underrepresented in structured data. Automating extraction from clinical notes can enhance diagnostic systems with insights into patients' social contexts.

Method: The study utilizes existing ICD-9 codes and applies reasoning models and traditional large language models to classify SDoH codes in hospital admission notes.

Result: An 89% F1 score was achieved in ICD-9 code classification. Additionally, missing SDoH codes were identified in 139 admissions.

Conclusion: Incorporating reasoning models and large language models provides an effective means of extracting and classifying SDoH codes, addressing gaps in structured data for improved decision-making in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1. Our contributions include our findings, missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions, and code to reproduce the results.

### [208] [The Geometry of Thought: Disclosing the Transformer as a Tropical Polynomial Circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09775)
*Faruk Alpay,Bilge Senturk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that Transformer self-attention operates in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra) under a high-confidence regime, linking it to dynamic programming and shortest-path algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to understand the underlying computational principles of Transformer self-attention mechanisms by exploring their behavior in extreme regimes.

Method: The method involves proving mathematically that Transformer self-attention, under the high-confidence (β → ∞) regime, becomes a tropical matrix product and relates to a dynamic programming recurrence on token similarity graphs.

Result: The study reveals that the forward pass of Transformers can be conceptualized as executing a Bellman-Ford pathfinding algorithm within a computed latent graph.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new geometric and algorithmic interpretation of Transformer computations, showing inherent shortest-path algorithms within self-attention mechanisms, offering insights into chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: We prove that the Transformer self-attention mechanism in the high-confidence regime ($β\to \infty$, where $β$ is an inverse temperature) operates in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra). In particular, we show that taking the tropical limit of the softmax attention converts it into a tropical matrix product. This reveals that the Transformer's forward pass is effectively executing a dynamic programming recurrence (specifically, a Bellman-Ford path-finding update) on a latent graph defined by token similarities. Our theoretical result provides a new geometric perspective for chain-of-thought reasoning: it emerges from an inherent shortest-path (or longest-path) algorithm being carried out within the network's computation.

### [209] [FaTRQ: Tiered Residual Quantization for LLM Vector Search in Far-Memory-Aware ANNS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09985)
*Tianqi Zhang,Flavio Ponzina,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FaTRQ, a more efficient refinement system for Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) that bypasses costly storage-fetch operations and significantly boosts throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing latency caused by costly second-pass refinement in ANNS systems, particularly for modern text and multimodal embeddings, necessitates a faster and storage-efficient method.

Method: The authors propose FaTRQ, which uses tiered memory to refine approximate results without fetching full-precision vectors from slower storage. Tiered residual quantization and a custom accelerator are key innovations.

Result: FaTRQ achieves a 2.4x improvement in storage efficiency and up to 9x better throughput compared to state-of-the-art GPU ANNS systems.

Conclusion: FaTRQ simplifies and accelerates ANNS by eliminating storage-fetch delays and leveraging tiered memory and hardware acceleration, making it highly effective for modern applications.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.

*Khalid Oublal,Quentin Bouniot,Qi Gan,Stephan Clémençon,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TimeSAE, a framework using Sparse Autoencoders and causality, to explain black-box models for time series data, achieving better robustness and faithfulness in explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing explanation methods that are sensitive to distributional shifts, especially in high-stakes, real-world domains that require interpretability and trust.

Method: The method combines Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality to explain black-box models for time series data, introducing a novel framework called TimeSAE.

Result: Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that TimeSAE outperforms existing baselines in providing robust and faithful explanations.

Conclusion: TimeSAE is a promising framework that resolves the issue of sensitivity to distributional shifts in black-box explanation methods and offers reliable explanations for time series data applications.

Abstract: As black box models and pretrained models gain traction in time series applications, understanding and explaining their predictions becomes increasingly vital, especially in high-stakes domains where interpretability and trust are essential. However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations. Our code is available in an easy-to-use library TimeSAE-Lib: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/TimeSAE-571D/.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework designed to enhance computational efficiency and reduce model parameter count while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in federated learning such as privacy requirements, system diversity, and computational burdens of complex models, and to explore the potential of quantum computing in this domain.

Method: The study proposes QFed, which applies quantum techniques to reduce parameter counts in classical models, and evaluates it using the FashionMNIST dataset.

Result: QFed reduced the parameter count of a VGG-like model by 77.6% while maintaining competitive accuracy in scalable environments.

Conclusion: Quantum computing can significantly improve federated learning by making it more efficient, particularly for edge device networks.

Abstract: Organizations and enterprises across domains such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research are increasingly required to extract collective intelligence from distributed, siloed datasets while adhering to strict privacy, regulatory, and sovereignty requirements. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops a localisation method for eluder dimension to achieve better regret bounds in reinforcement learning problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard eluder dimension analysis was not sufficient for obtaining first-order regret bounds, necessitating improved methods.

Method: A localisation technique for eluder dimension was introduced to refine the analysis of regret bounds.

Result: The localisation approach recovers and improves on Bernoulli bandit results and delivers first genuine first-order bounds for reinforcement learning tasks with bounded cumulative returns.

Conclusion: The localisation method resolves limitations of standard eluder dimension analysis and offers improved theoretical bounds in specific learning scenarios.

Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the eluder dimension of generalised linear model classes, showing that standard eluder dimension-based analysis cannot lead to first-order regret bounds. To address this, we introduce a localisation method for the eluder dimension; our analysis immediately recovers and improves on classic results for Bernoulli bandits, and allows for the first genuine first-order bounds for finite-horizon reinforcement learning tasks with bounded cumulative returns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in existing theoretical results by proving the convergence of PnP-PGD in scenarios where the denoiser is trained on a different data distribution than the inference task.

Method: Developed a novel convergence theory that eliminates restrictive and unverifiable assumptions used in prior works.

Result: Achieved the first convergence proof for PnP-PGD under prior mismatch.

Abstract: In this work, we provide a new convergence theory for plug-and-play proximal gradient descent (PnP-PGD) under prior mismatch where the denoiser is trained on a different data distribution to the inference task at hand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence proof of PnP-PGD under prior mismatch. Compared with the existing theoretical results for PnP algorithms, our new results removed the need for several restrictive and unverifiable assumptions.

### [214] [Step-by-Step Causality: Transparent Causal Discovery with Multi-Agent Tree-Query and Adversarial Confidence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10137)
*Ziyi Ding,Chenfei Ye-Hao,Zheyuan Wang,Xiao-Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tree-Query introduces a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework for interpretable causal discovery queries, improving identification accuracy over direct LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical constraint-based methods for causal discovery suffer from error propagation, and LLM-based methods lack interpretability and confidence estimation, prompting the need for a robust, interpretable framework.

Method: The paper develops Tree-Query, which transforms causal discovery into structured queries involving backdoor paths, independence, latent confounding, and causal direction. The framework provides theoretical guarantees for the identifiability of pairwise relations.

Result: Tree-Query outperforms direct LLM baselines on structural metrics in data-free benchmarks, and successfully applies to a case study on diet-weight causality, demonstrating confounder screening and stable causal conclusions.

Conclusion: Tree-Query provides an interpretable and robust approach to causal discovery using LLMs, complementing data-driven causal research with data-free causal priors.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover ``what causes what'', but classical constraint-based methods (e.g., PC, FCI) suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes. This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

### [215] [A pipeline for enabling path-specific causal fairness in observational health data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09841)
*Aparajita Kashyap,Sara Matijevic,Noémie Elhadad,Steven A. Kushner,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline to train machine learning models ensuring causal fairness in healthcare by addressing direct and indirect biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure ML models deployed in healthcare do not exacerbate existing biases and incorporate considerations of social and medical contexts in fairness measurements.

Method: The study maps a structural fairness model to observational healthcare settings, trains causally fair models through a pipeline, and detangles sources of bias using healthcare-specific contexts.

Result: The pipeline successfully trains models addressing direct and indirect healthcare biases, enabling causally fair predictions leveraging foundational models.

Conclusion: The proposed model-agnostic pipeline ensures causal fairness in ML models for healthcare by explicitly incorporating contextual biases, advancing fairness-accuracy tradeoff understanding.

Abstract: When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target "fair" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the "fairness-accuracy" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.

### [216] [Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Step Lookahead Information Via Adaptive Batching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10418)
*Nadav Merlis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores tabular reinforcement learning with multiple steps of future lookahead information, introducing adaptive batching policies (ABPs) to address issues with fixed batching and model predictive control approaches, and proposes a regret-minimizing algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exist significant challenges in leveraging multi-step lookahead information in reinforcement learning due to NP-hardness of finding optimal policies and shortcomings of existing heuristics.

Method: The paper introduces adaptive batching policies (ABPs) guided by optimal Bellman equations and designs an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm to learn these strategies in unknown environments.

Result: The approach achieves regret bounds close to the optimal order, adjusted by a factor dependent on the lookahead horizon, which is typically small.

Conclusion: Using adaptive batching strategies (ABPs) with multi-step lookahead information improves reinforcement learning outcomes, addressing prior inefficiencies effectively, while maintaining practical learning guarantees.

Abstract: We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.

*Jacob Sander,Brian Jalaian,Venkat R. Dasari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrated framework for optimizing LLMs on resource-constrained devices using quantization, adaptation, and data distillation methods to reduce size while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on edge devices is challenging due to their high computational, memory, and energy demands. The authors aim to optimize these models for such environments while ensuring task-specific performance.

Method: The framework combines GPTQ-based quantization, LoRA for fine-tuning, a data distillation process, knowledge distillation using Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer to enhance efficiency and reduce resource usage.

Result: The approach achieves up to 2x memory compression, supports efficient inference for specialized tasks, and outperforms GPTQ quantization alone on LLM benchmarks, with improved resistance to accuracy loss during quantization.

Conclusion: The presented pipeline effectively reduces the size and complexity of LLMs while maintaining or even enhancing task-specific performance, making them suitable for use on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable advanced natural language processing but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.

*Kirandeep Kaur,Vinayak Gupta,Aditya Gupta,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProPer is a two-agent system designed to address unmet user needs in language-based assistants through proactive personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional language assistants which fail to address unexpressed user needs effectively or make mistimed, unnecessary interventions.

Method: ProPer employs a two-agent architecture: the Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) generates implicit dimensions from user data, which are filtered for relevancy, and the Response Generating Agent (RGA) provides proactive, personalized interventions based on these dimensions.

Result: ProPer demonstrated improved performance in user response quality, achieving up to 84% improvement in single-turn evaluations and consistent success in multi-turn interactions.

Conclusion: ProPer enhances the effectiveness of proactive assistants by balancing explicit and implicit dimensions to provide relevant, timely, and personalized responses across various domains.

Abstract: Most language-based assistants follow a reactive ask-and-respond paradigm, requiring users to explicitly state their needs. As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.

*Chenxi Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpolation-based framework optimizing lp-norm metric Differential Privacy for fine-grained or continuous domains, overcoming computational challenges and improving privacy utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing metric Differential Privacy is challenging in fine-grained or continuous domains due to computational cost and privacy constraint complexities.

Method: The proposed method uses sparse anchor point optimization and log-convex interpolation of distributions, combined with a corrected formulation enforcing lp-norm metric Differential Privacy by design.

Result: Experiments on real-world location datasets show the framework provides rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming traditional mechanisms.

Conclusion: The interpolation-based framework effectively optimizes metric Differential Privacy in challenging settings, balancing rigorous privacy and improved utility.

Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) generalizes Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by adapting privacy guarantees based on pairwise distances, enabling context-aware protection and improved utility. While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.
  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

*Griffin Kearney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Kinematic Tokenization, a continuous-time framework for tokenizing noisy real-world data like financial time series, improving predictive performance in asymmetric, noise-resilient tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of discrete tokenization techniques, which struggle with low signal-to-noise environments and asymmetric penalties in decision-making tasks.

Method: Kinematic Tokenization optimizes continuous-time representations by reconstructing splines from noisy observations, then tokenizes the coefficients (e.g., position, velocity, acceleration) for tasks like financial modeling.

Result: The method demonstrated superior performance compared to discrete baselines on a financial time series dataset, avoiding trivial outcomes and enabling stable, calibrated decision-making policies.

Conclusion: Continuous-time tokens like those developed in Kinematic Tokenization can enhance learning and policy stability in noisy, complex scenarios with asymmetric loss structures.

Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.

TL;DR: The paper identifies economic injustices in the machine learning data value chain, caused by unequal profit distribution and structural faults. It introduces EDVEX, a framework for equitable data value exchange.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address economic inequities in the machine learning value chain, where data creators are inadequately compensated, threatening sustainability and fairness in the system.

Method: The paper analyzes seventy-three public data deals, identifies structural faults in the machine learning data cycle, and proposes the EDVEX framework for equitable exchange.

Result: Findings reveal significant inequity: aggregators capture most value while data creators receive minimal royalties. Structural faults in bargaining power, provenance, and pricing are identified.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that current practices in the machine learning value chain are unsustainable and propose the EDVEX framework as a pathway to equitable value distribution for all stakeholders.

Abstract: We argue that the machine learning value chain is structurally unsustainable due to an economic data processing inequality: each state in the data cycle from inputs to model weights to synthetic outputs refines technical signal but strips economic equity from data generators. We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants. Finally, we outline research directions where our community can make concrete contributions to data deals and contextualize our position with related and orthogonal viewpoints.

*Maissam Barkeshli,Alberto Alfarano,Andrey Gromov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies scaling laws for transformers by exploring training on simplified datasets and demonstrates their emergence without inherent data power law structures. It revisits traditional scaling laws and introduces refined methods for compute optimal curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origins of neural scaling laws and determine whether their emergence requires inherent power law structure in data, while also improving predictive methods for AI model scaling.

Method: Scaling laws are studied using transformers trained on random walks on graphs with tunable complexity and systematically simplified generative language models. The researchers also analyze scaling results from graphs and revisit scaling principles in language modeling.

Result: The study shows neural scaling laws emerge even without inherent power law data structures and derives scaling exponents with simplified language models and graph walks. It also critiques current fitting methods and proposes an alternative parameterization approach.

Conclusion: Neural scaling laws are intrinsic even in simplified data environments. The study provides new insights into efficient model parameterization and refined analysis for scaling practices.

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.

*Hansen He,Shuheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines hybrid architectures combining time series encoders with frozen large language models (LLMs), finding that Inception-based encoders consistently improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in leveraging the reasoning and generalization abilities of large language models (LLMs) for time series classification (TSC) inspired this study.

Method: The authors explored various hybrid architectures pairing LLM backbones with different time series encoder types, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures.

Result: The study found that only the Inception-based encoder consistently enhanced the performance when paired with an LLM backbone.

Conclusion: Inception-based models show significant potential as effective encoders for time series tasks within LLM hybrid frameworks, offering a promising path for future research in LLM-driven time series classification.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a core machine learning problem with broad applications. Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.

*Frank Cole,Dixi Wang,Yineng Chen,Yulong Lu,Rongjie Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces in-context operator learning for optimal transport, enabling accurate solutions without gradient updates using minimal samples as prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently solve optimal transport problems by learning a solution operator that can generalize across distributions using few-shot samples, enhancing computational simplicity at inference.

Method: The authors propose a parameterized solution operator and develop scaling-law theory for nonparametric and parametric regimes, supported by generalization bounds and explicit architecture design.

Result: The method achieves accurate outputs both theoretically and through validation experiments on synthetic and generative-model benchmarks.

Conclusion: In-context operator learning effectively handles optimal transport tasks with limited inference complexity and sample sizes.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{in-context operator learning on probability measure spaces} for optimal transport (OT). The goal is to learn a single solution operator that maps a pair of distributions to the OT map, using only few-shot samples from each distribution as a prompt and \emph{without} gradient updates at inference. We parameterize the solution operator and develop scaling-law theory in two regimes. In the \emph{nonparametric} setting, when tasks concentrate on a low-intrinsic-dimension manifold of source--target pairs, we establish generalization bounds that quantify how in-context accuracy scales with prompt size, intrinsic task dimension, and model capacity. In the \emph{parametric} setting (e.g., Gaussian families), we give an explicit architecture that recovers the exact OT map in context and provide finite-sample excess-risk bounds. Our numerical experiments on synthetic transports and generative-modeling benchmarks validate the framework.

### [225] [Continuous-Depth Transformers with Learned Control Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10007)
*Peter Jemley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid transformer with continuous-depth ODE blocks for steerable language generation, validated through various experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance traditional transformers by introducing a mechanism to control generation attributes during inference, improving functionality and efficiency.

Method: The model uses Neural ODE blocks, treating depth as a continuous variable, influenced by a control signal $u$, allowing dynamic and steerable processing.

Result: The model achieves gradient stability, high semantic steering accuracy, efficient trajectory interpolation, and latency comparable to standard baselines, with insights into vector field structure.

Conclusion: Continuous-depth dynamics and learned control signals offer an effective and efficient approach for steerable language generation.

Abstract: We present a hybrid transformer architecture that replaces discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) block, enabling inference-time control over generation attributes via a learned steering signal. Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_θ(H, τ, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\%/88\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.

### [226] [PID-Guided Partial Alignment for Multimodal Decentralized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10012)
*Yanhang Shi,Xiaoyu Wang,Houwei Cao,Jian Li,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) faces challenges due to differences in modalities and architectures among agents, which must collaborate peer-to-peer without a central coordinator. PARSE, a novel framework, introduces a method for selective knowledge sharing based on partial information decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decentralized federated learning for multimodal applications is challenging due to inconsistent gradient sharing and modality differences among distributed agents, causing inefficiencies and conflicts.

Method: The paper introduces PARSE, a framework based on partial information decomposition, enabling agents to factorize their latent representations into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. Slice-level sharing is implemented, allowing semantically relevant branches to be exchanged among peer agents.

Result: PARSE demonstrates consistent performance improvements over existing DFL systems across various benchmarks, configurations, and sharing schemes, resolving modality-specific gradient conflicts.

Conclusion: PARSE effectively addresses the multimodal DFL dilemma, fostering efficient and robust collaboration without the need for centralized coordination or intrusive gradient modifications.

Abstract: Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) is challenging because agents differ in available modalities and model architectures, yet must collaborate over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks without a central coordinator. Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.

### [227] [CAFEDistill: Learning Personalized and Dynamic Models through Federated Early-Exit Network Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10015)
*Boyi Liu,Zimu Zhou,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAFEDistill is a personalized federated learning method designed for dynamic inference requirements, integrating early-exit networks to balance accuracy and efficiency effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static models in federated learning when dealing with heterogeneous data and varying inference needs.

Method: CAFEDistill introduces a conflict-aware distillation framework for integrating early-exit networks in personalized federated learning, featuring depth-prioritized student coordination and communication-efficient mechanisms.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance with higher accuracy and a reduction in inference costs by 30.79%–46.86%, compared to existing federated learning methods.

Conclusion: CAFEDistill successfully balances personalization, model efficiency, and adaptability in federated learning, thus addressing client heterogeneity and adaptive inference needs.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables collaboratively model training on decentralized, heterogeneous data while tailoring them to each client's unique distribution. However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

### [228] [Time Aggregation Features for XGBoost Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10019)
*Mykola Pinchuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates time aggregation methods for XGBoost in click-through rate prediction on the Avazu dataset, finding trailing windows provide consistent performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve click-through rate predictions by exploring feature engineering methods that consider historical data in a strictly time-limited setting.

Method: The authors used the Avazu dataset with a strict out-of-time split protocol. Time aggregation features based on impressions before a given hour were incorporated into XGBoost models and compared against a baseline of time-aware target encoding.

Result: Trailing window designs improved ROC AUC by 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by 0.0084 to 0.0094 over the baseline. Event count windows offered marginal gains, while other designs like gap and bucketized windows underperformed, confirming trailing windows' robustness.

Conclusion: Trailing windows should be the default time aggregation approach, with event count windows as an optional secondary enhancement when precision gains are needed.

Abstract: This paper studies time aggregation features for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction. The setting is the Avazu click-through rate prediction dataset with strict out-of-time splits and a no-lookahead feature constraint. Features for hour H use only impressions from hours strictly before H. This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs. Across two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic ten percent sample, a trailing window specification improves ROC AUC by about 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by about 0.0084 to 0.0094 relative to target encoding alone. Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small. Gap windows and bucketized windows underperform simple trailing windows in this dataset and protocol. These results support a practical default of trailing windows, with an optional event count window when marginal ROC AUC gains matter.

### [229] [BPE: Behavioral Profiling Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10024)
*Yanxin Liu,Yunqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE), a framework that integrates models based on their inherent behavioral profiles rather than conventional model divergence, achieving better accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional ensemble methods that rely heavily on model divergence and overlook per-model intrinsic behaviors, thus improving integration and predictive performance.

Method: Introducing Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE), which builds a behavioral profile for each model and assigns weights according to the deviation between a model's response on a test instance and its profile.

Result: BPE achieves significant improvements in predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and storage compared to state-of-the-art ensemble methods.

Conclusion: The BPE framework overcomes the shortcomings of traditional ensemble approaches and demonstrates superior performance and efficiency across different datasets and scenarios.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is widely recognized as a pivotal strategy for pushing the boundaries of predictive performance. Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. These gains are evident not only in predictive accuracy but also in computational efficiency and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.

### [230] [Unlabeled Data Can Provably Enhance In-Context Learning of Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10058)
*Renpu Liu,Jing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an augmented in-context learning (ICL) framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data, alongside chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, to improve the accuracy of language models. This is both empirically and theoretically validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by the small number of labeled demonstrations fitting into a prompt, ignoring the vast amounts of unlabeled data that could improve performance. The study seeks to utilize such data effectively to enhance ICL.

Method: The authors introduce an augmented ICL framework where the prompt combines a small set of labeled examples with a block of unlabeled inputs. They demonstrate that transformers can implicitly perform an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm using CoT prompting and achieve better accuracy. Additionally, teacher forcing is employed to train transformers with provable convergence to the desired solution.

Result: The augmented ICL framework improves prediction accuracy over conventional few-shot ICL. Empirical experiments back the theoretical claims about leveraging unlabeled data and CoT prompting in transformer models.

Conclusion: Leveraging unlabeled data in the proposed augmented ICL framework with appropriate prompting significantly improves both the theoretical and empirical performance of LLMs. This could redefine how unlabeled data is utilized in the context of language modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, yet the quality of their predictions is fundamentally limited by the few costly labeled demonstrations that can fit into a prompt. Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.

### [231] [Efficient Content-based Recommendation Model Training via Noise-aware Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10067)
*Hung Vinh Tran,Tong Chen,Hechuan Wen,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Bin Cui,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NaCS, a framework for creating high-quality coresets for content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) that reduces training overhead while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRSs require extensive training on large datasets to account for diverse user preferences, leading to high computational costs. Efficient coreset selection can mitigate these demands, but existing methods struggle with noise in user-item interactions.

Method: NaCS uses submodular optimization to create coresets informed by training gradients, corrects noisy labels with a progressively trained model, and filters out low-confidence samples to avoid unreliable data.

Result: Experiments show NaCS achieves 93-95% performance of full-dataset training using just 1% of the data, outperforming existing coreset selection methods in efficiency and quality.

Conclusion: NaCS is an effective and efficient solution for reducing the training demands of CRSs while overcoming challenges of noisy interactions, making it a promising approach for practical applications in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

*Mohammad Abbadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study introduces a deep learning model (HuSHeM) for assessing sperm morphology, showing improved predictive reliability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce subjectivity, inconsistencies, and resource limitations in assessing sperm morphology, thus enhancing male fertility evaluations.

Method: A comparative study was conducted using the HuSHeM deep learning model trained on high-res sperm images, compared to WHO(+SIRI) criteria through performance evaluations like discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses.

Result: HuSHeM exhibited superior results in discrimination (higher AUC), precision-recall under class imbalance, calibration, and decision curve/net clinical benefit analysis.

Conclusion: Image-based deep learning models, such as HuSHeM, provide more objective and reproducible assessments for sperm morphology and can enhance fertility evaluation workflows.

Abstract: Assessment of sperm morphological quality remains a critical yet subjective component of male fertility evaluation, often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).
  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.
  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse-RL addresses key challenges in RL training for LLMs tied to memory-heavy KV caching by correcting off-policy bias and improving training stability under sparse rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome the memory overhead in RL training of Large Language Models, which limits efficient training on hardware with constrained resources.

Method: Sparse-RL introduces Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to resolve policy mismatches and off-policy bias caused by KV compression.

Result: Experiments show that Sparse-RL reduces memory overhead while maintaining model performance and enhances robustness during sparse inference deployment.

Conclusion: Sparse-RL presents a solution for stable RL training by addressing sparsity-induced challenges, making it effective for hardware-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

*Zan Chaudhry,Noam H. Rotenberg,Brian Caffo,Craig K. Jones,Haris I. Sair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a method to detect mislabeled data using deep learning models, which outperforms existing methods in sensitivity while maintaining precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning systems underperform due to incorrect ground truth labels, even with expert-curated data. Addressing mislabeling is essential to improve model performance.

Method: ALED identifies mislabeled samples by extracting an intermediate feature space using a deep convolutional neural network, denoising the features, modeling class manifolds with Gaussian distributions, and applying a likelihood ratio test.

Result: ALED shows superior sensitivity and precision compared to existing methods on medical imaging datasets, and correcting errors with ALED reduced test errors by 33.8%.

Conclusion: ALED provides an effective solution to detect and correct mislabeling, significantly improving machine learning model accuracy. It is available in the Python package statlab.

Abstract: Machine learning classification systems are susceptible to poor performance when trained with incorrect ground truth labels, even when data is well-curated by expert annotators. As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users. The ALED detector is deployed in the Python package statlab.

*Ashley Klein,Edward Raff,Marcia DesJardin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian approach to address limitations in medical meta-analyses, especially when critical decision variables are missing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to resolve the issue of unreliable conclusions in medical meta-analyses caused by the absence of key decision variables that influence clinical decisions.

Method: The authors propose and construct a Bayesian approach to analyze medical scenarios. This is demonstrated through an application on evaluating TOLAC (Trial of Labor After Cesarean-section) situations in professional OBGYN decision-making processes.

Result: Using the proposed Bayesian approach, the study identifies support for physicians to improve patient care in such scenarios with limited intervention options.

Conclusion: The Bayesian method effectively handles scenarios where standard meta-analyses are unreliable, providing essential insights for advancing medical practices.

Abstract: The meta-analysis's utility is dependent on previous studies having accurately captured the variables of interest, but in medical studies, a key decision variable that impacts a physician's decisions was not captured. This results in an unknown effect size and unreliable conclusions. A Bayesian approach may allow analysis to determine if the claim of a positive effect is still warranted, and we build a Bayesian approach to this common medical scenario. To demonstrate its utility, we assist professional OBGYNs in evaluating Trial of Labor After a Cesarean-section (TOLAC) situations where few interventions are available for patients and find the support needed for physicians to advance patient care.

*Jongseok Kim,Seongae Kang,Jonghwan Shin,Yuhan Lee,Ohyun Jo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework for multimodal clinical predictions, improving performance by integrating level-specific representations within modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal clinical prediction models rely on simplistic, static fusion strategies and fail to maximize modality-specific representations, necessitating more advanced integration methods.

Method: The authors propose LeMoF, which integrates representations from different encoder layers (levels) and separates predictions into modality-level and level-specific categories, ensuring balanced stability and discriminative capacity.

Result: LeMoF consistently outperformed state-of-the-art techniques in predicting ICU length of stay and demonstrated the importance of level-wise integration for clinical prediction tasks.

Conclusion: LeMoF offers robust and superior predictive performance by leveraging level-guided modality representations, making it highly effective for diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical prediction is widely used to integrate heterogeneous data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and biosignals. However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.

*Piyush Singh Pasi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces METAL, a method to align multilingual text embeddings with multimodal spaces, achieving competitive performance in English and strong zero-shot results across 11 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models mainly excel in English due to abundant data availability, while performance in other languages lags due to limited multilingual multimodal resources.

Method: METAL, a lightweight alignment approach, maps multilingual text embeddings into a shared multimodal space using only English text for training and a few linear layers.

Result: METAL achieves competitive English baseline performance (94.9% Recall at 10) and strong zero-shot multilingual transfer (89.5% Recall at 10). It aligns multilingual embeddings with multimodal representations effectively.

Conclusion: The METAL method demonstrates that simple alignment techniques can achieve strong multilingual and multimodal performance, providing tools and datasets for further research in this domain.

Abstract: Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation. We release code and checkpoints at https://github.com/m2m-codebase/M2M , as well as multilingual evaluation datasets including MSCOCO Multilingual 30K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/mscoco-multilingual-30k ), AudioCaps Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/audiocaps-multilingual ), and Clotho Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/clotho-multilingual ), to facilitate further research.

*Jiawen Zhang,Yangfan Hu,Kejia Chen,Lipeng He,Jiachen Ma,Jian Lou,Dan Li,Jian Liu,Xiaohu Yang,Ruoxi Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method called Safety-Preserving Fine-tuning (SPF) to address the safety-utility dilemma during fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs often compromises safety alignment, making them vulnerable to issues like jailbreak attacks even with harmless fine-tuning data. Existing solutions face a tradeoff between safety and task performance.

Method: The authors analyze gradients with geometric insights, revealing key properties like low-rank safety subspaces and negative correlation with utility-oriented gradients. They propose SPF, which removes gradient components conflicting with safety alignment during fine-tuning.

Result: SPF guarantees utility convergence while limiting safety drift. Empirical studies show it consistently maintains task performance, restores pre-trained safety, and resists deep fine-tuning and jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: SPF offers a practical and theoretically-backed approach to ensure safety-aligned fine-tuning of LLMs, balancing performance and alignment. It advances understanding of safety during model adaptation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.
  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.

*Qiang Yu,Xinran Cheng,Shiqiang Xu,Chuanyi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel contrastive learning method called SNGCL for node classification tasks in graph learning, addressing key challenges related to view generation and reliance on negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning approaches for graph data face inefficiencies in view generation and rely heavily on negative samples, which is problematic for node classification tasks.

Method: SNGCL uses a multilayer Laplace smoothing filter to create global and local feature matrices and an improved triple recombination loss function to optimize classification efficiency.

Result: Experimental comparisons demonstrate SNGCL outperforms state-of-the-art models in various node classification tasks.

Conclusion: SNGCL effectively addresses challenges in graph-based node classification with enhanced features and a refined loss function, offering strong competitive performance.

Abstract: The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.

*Aryan Karmore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOOKAT, a compression method for the KV cache in large language models, offering up to 64× storage compression while retaining high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying large language models on edge devices is challenging due to storage and bandwidth constraints of the KV cache.

Method: LOOKAT applies techniques like product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, optimizing attention table calculations by converting key vectors into subspaces and utilizing lookup tables.

Result: LOOKAT achieves up to 64× compression with 95.7% fidelity and 32× compression with 95.0% fidelity, maintaining rank correlation above 0.95.

Conclusion: LOOKAT effectively compresses KV caches without requiring architectural changes, making large language models more feasible for edge deployment.

Abstract: Compressing the KV cache is a required step to deploy large language models on edge devices. Current quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth as attention calculation requires dequantizing keys from INT4/INT8 to FP16 before use. We observe that attention scoring is mathematically equivalent to the inner product similarity search and we can apply some compression techniques from vector databases to compress KV-cache better. We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\times$ compression at 95.7\% output fidelity and 32 $\times$ compression at 95.0\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2. LOOKAT requires no architecture changes or training while maintaining rank correlation $ρ> 0.95$. Theoretical analysis confirms that rank correlation degrades as $O(d_k/mK)$, with guarantees validated across sequence lengths up to 1024 tokens.

*Mingyu Zhao,Haoran Bai,Yu Tian,Bing Zhu,Hengliang Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CC-OR-Net, a method to address challenges in Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, characterized by zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. It achieves better prediction accuracy for both low-to-medium and high-value users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately predicting LTV for datasets with a skewed distribution, where the majority of users have low-to-medium value but a small group of high-value users significantly influences business outcomes.

Method: It proposes CC-OR-Net, a unified framework with three components: a structural ordinal decomposition module for ranking, an intra-bucket residual module for fine-grained regression, and a high-value augmentation module for focusing on top-tier users. This structure enables robust and precise LTV predictions.

Result: The CC-OR-Net model was tested on datasets with over 300 million users and demonstrated superior performance in balancing global accuracy with precision for high-value user groups, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CC-OR-Net provides an effective, commercially valuable solution for LTV prediction by structurally addressing ranking and regression challenges, making it especially beneficial for identifying and targeting high-value customers.

Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, a central problem in modern marketing, is characterized by a unique zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value "whale" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{C}ascaded \textbf{O}rdinal-\textbf{R}esidual Networks \textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed. CC-OR-Net integrates three specialized components: a \textit{structural ordinal decomposition module} for robust ranking, an \textit{intra-bucket residual module} for fine-grained regression, and a \textit{targeted high-value augmentation module} for precision on top-tier users. Evaluated on real-world datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across all key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in creating a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution.

### [242] [Bias in the Shadows: Explore Shortcuts in Encrypted Network Traffic Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10180)
*Chuyi Wang,Xiaohui Xie,Tongze Wang,Yong Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiasSeeker, a framework to detect spurious shortcut features in encrypted traffic for improved generalization in network traffic classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained models in encrypted NTC often rely on spurious correlations, which hinder their real-world applicability.

Method: BiasSeeker uses statistical correlation analysis on raw binary traffic to identify shortcut features, with category-specific validation strategies to preserve meaningful data.

Result: BiasSeeker was tested on 19 datasets across multiple NTC tasks, effectively diagnosing and reducing dataset-specific biases.

Conclusion: BiasSeeker highlights the importance of intentional and scenario-sensitive feature selection to combat shortcut learning challenges before model training.

Abstract: Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.
  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.

### [243] [Reinforcement Learning to Discover a NorthEast Monsoon Index for Monthly Rainfall Prediction in Thailand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10181)
*Kiattikun Chobtham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a NorthEast Monsoon Climate Index based on sea surface temperature, optimized using a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning approach, to enhance long-term rainfall prediction in Thailand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in using local-scale climate indices for improving the accuracy of long-term rainfall predictions in Thailand, especially beyond global indices like El Niño.

Method: A Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent is employed to optimize the calculated areas used for the NorthEast Monsoon Climate Index. The optimized index is then incorporated into Long Short-Term Memory models for rainfall prediction.

Result: Incorporating the optimized climate index into rainfall prediction models significantly improved the forecasting accuracy for 12-month-ahead predictions, as evidenced by reduced Root Mean Square Errors.

Conclusion: The proposed NorthEast Monsoon Climate Index and reinforcement learning-based optimization effectively enhance rainfall prediction accuracy, making it a valuable tool for regional climate studies.

Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.

### [244] [Graph Regularized PCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10199)
*Antonio Briola,Marwin Schmidt,Fabio Caccioli,Carlos Ros Perez,James Singleton,Christian Michler,Tomaso Aste*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA) is introduced to improve dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data with non-isotropic noise by incorporating dependency structures using graph Laplacians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PCA assumes isotropic noise, often failing to capture the dependencies among features in data when noise is non-spherically distributed.

Method: GR-PCA introduces graph-based regularization by learning sparse precision graphs and biasing principal component loadings toward low-frequency graph Laplacian modes.

Result: GR-PCA shows improved variance concentration on intended features, lower graph-Laplacian energy, and better structural fidelity while being competitive in predictive performance.

Conclusion: GR-PCA enhances dimensionality reduction for data with graph-correlated high-frequency signals, offering interpretable and structure-aware principal components without sacrificing predictive ability.

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.

### [245] [PRL: Process Reward Learning Improves LLMs' Reasoning Ability and Broadens the Reasoning Boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10201)
*Jiarui Yao,Ruida Wang,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Process Reward Learning (PRL), a novel framework to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating intermediate process supervision signals with theoretical backing to improve optimization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities, where most works rely on trajectory-level outcome rewards or additional complex frameworks, and to provide a theoretical foundation for designing intermediate reward signals.

Method: The authors propose PRL, which decomposes an entropy-regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, incorporating rigorous process rewards derived from a theoretical framework. PRL formulates optimization as reward maximization along with a KL-divergence penalty term with respect to a reference model.

Result: Experimental results show that PRL improves LLMs' reasoning metrics such as average @ n and pass @ n. Moreover, it broadens reasoning capabilities and demonstrates effective, generalized performance across experiments.

Conclusion: PRL is an efficient, theoretically-supported framework that improves both reasoning ability and training efficiency in LLMs by transforming outcome rewards into fine-grained process supervision signals during optimization.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.

### [246] [Fundamental Limitations of Favorable Privacy-Utility Guarantees for DP-SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10237)
*Murat Bilgehan Ertan,Marten van Dijk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the limitations of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) using the $f$-differential privacy framework, highlighting trade-offs between privacy guarantees and utility under worst-case adversarial scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the fundamental privacy-utility trade-offs in DP-SGD under worst-case adversarial privacy frameworks using the $f$-differential privacy.

Method: The study uses hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, analyzes shuffled sampling with $M$ gradient updates in DP-SGD, derives bounds on privacy parameters, and provides a theoretical foundation for the noise multiplier $σ$ and separation $κ.

Result: The paper demonstrates that meaningful privacy (small $κ$) necessitates a high noise multiplier ($σ$), which impacts the utility of DP-SGD. The bounds indicate a bottleneck in achieving both strong privacy and high accuracy, with slow convergence towards ideal conditions as $M$ increases.

Conclusion: DP-SGD faces inherent limitations under adversarial assumptions, where ensuring robust privacy results in substantial accuracy degradation, especially in realistic training settings.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy
  $σ\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln M}}$ $\quad\text{or}\quad$ $κ\ge\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\!\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{4π\ln M}}\right)$,
  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \to \infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.

### [247] [X-SAM: Boosting Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Dominant-Eigenvector Gradient Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10251)
*Hongru Duan,Yongle Chen,Lei Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates why Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) doesn't consistently align with its theoretical goals, proposing a new method called X-SAM that uses eigenvector-aligned gradient correction to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap between SAM's theoretical goals and its optimization behavior during training, where sharp regions can still produce small perturbed losses, undermining generalization.

Method: The paper introduces X-SAM, which aligns the gradient correction with the leading eigenvector of the Hessian to directly regularize sharpness and improve generalization.

Result: X-SAM provides provable convergence and demonstrates superior generalization performance in both theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: X-SAM effectively resolves limitations in SAM by aligning optimization steps with the leading eigenvector of the Hessian, proving to be a theoretically sound and practically effective method for improving generalization.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve generalization by minimizing a worst-case perturbed loss over a small neighborhood of model parameters. However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.

*Ziqiong Wang,Tianqi Ren,Rongpeng Li,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework for enhancing the robustness of Separate Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) against bit errors in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the cliff effect in SSCC systems caused by residual bit errors, which can disrupt lossless source decoding, and to improve decoding robustness without altering the transmitter.

Method: The method introduces a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework using an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) for bit reliability, bitstream evaluation, ranked candidate selection, LLM-based arithmetic decoding, and a reliability-likelihood fusion rule. Theoretical guarantees for sampling stability and convergence are also provided.

Result: The proposed ICD framework demonstrates consistent performance improvements in SSCC decoding across various communication scenarios involving AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.

Conclusion: The ICD approach proves effective in mitigating SSCC weaknesses, offering enhanced robustness to bit errors, and showcasing practical gains over traditional SSCC and JSCC methods.

Abstract: Separate Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) remains attractive for text transmission due to its modularity and compatibility with mature entropy coders and powerful channel codes. However, SSCC often suffers from a pronounced cliff effect in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where residual bit errors after channel decoding can catastrophically break lossless source decoding, especially for Arithmetic Coding (AC) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework that enhances SSCC robustness without modifying the transmitter. ICD leverages an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) to obtain bit-wise reliability for the decoded information bits. Based on the context-consistent bitstream, ICD constructs a confidence-ranked candidate pool via reliability-guided bit flipping, samples a compact yet diverse subset of candidates, and applies an LLM-based arithmetic decoder to obtain both reconstructions and sequence-level log-likelihoods. A reliability-likelihood fusion rule then selects the final output. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed sampling procedure. Extensive experiments over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate consistent gains compared with conventional SSCC baselines and representative Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of run-to-failure labels while providing unsupervised health monitoring for turbofan engines across diverse operating conditions.

Method: The framework uses regression-based normalization to remove operating-condition effects and trains an LSTM autoencoder on healthy data. Alerts are triggered by persistent reconstruction errors using adaptive thresholds.

Result: High recall and low false-alarm rates are achieved across different operating regimes, showing the system's adaptability and scalability for diverse fleet monitoring.

Conclusion: The approach allows quick deployment and serves as an effective, scalable health-monitoring system for turbofan engines, complementing Remaining Useful Life models.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised health-monitoring framework for turbofan engines that does not require run-to-failure labels. First, operating-condition effects in NASA CMAPSS sensor streams are removed via regression-based normalisation; then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder is trained only on the healthy portion of each trajectory. Persistent reconstruction error, estimated using an adaptive data-driven threshold, triggers real-time alerts without hand-tuned rules. Benchmark results show high recall and low false-alarm rates across multiple operating regimes, demonstrating that the method can be deployed quickly, scale to diverse fleets, and serve as a complementary early-warning layer to Remaining Useful Life models.

*Emre Ozbas,Melih Bastopcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses optimizing large language model server operations by allocating computational tokens to queries for an optimal accuracy-latency trade-off, within constraints and using mathematical modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently manage a large language model server handling different query types, ensuring optimal accuracy and latency while respecting computational and queue-stability constraints.

Method: The authors frame a constrained optimization problem for token allocation to maximize weighted accuracy and minimize latency in a queue system, leveraging mathematical modeling, iterative solvers, and gradient-based methods.

Result: The developed methodologies provide optimal token allocations and projections, ensuring convergence under conditions and minimizing performance losses, validated through simulation results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully allocates tokens for balancing accuracy and latency in heterogeneous query streams, offering practical solutions suitable for large language models in constrained environments.

Abstract: We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.

*Jose Marie Antonio Minoza*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes SPIKE, a method enhancing PINNs with sparse Koopman operators for better generalization and long-term prediction accuracy in solving complex dynamic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overfitting and poor generalization limitations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for complex and dynamic systems.

Method: Introduced SPIKE, which integrates Koopman operators with L1 regularization to enforce sparse linear dynamics in a learned observable space, aiming for parsimonious representations.

Result: SPIKE achieves improved temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and stable long-term predictions, demonstrated across various complex dynamical systems like fluid dynamics and chaotic systems.

Conclusion: SPIKE provides a robust framework for improving PINNs' performance, enhancing their capability to predict and generalize over complex differential equations with stability.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the DualCD framework for improving deep learning models in domain incremental time series classification by disentangling causal features and reducing confounding effects, showing enhanced performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series classification struggle in domain incremental learning, where models must adapt to new domains without forgetting prior knowledge.

Method: The proposed DualCD framework includes a temporal feature disentanglement module to separate causal and spurious features, along with a dual-causal intervention mechanism that eliminates intra- and inter-class confounding features.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets and models show that DualCD significantly enhances domain incremental learning performance and sets a new benchmark for this problem.

Conclusion: DualCD boosts robustness and predictive accuracy for time series classification models in domain incremental scenarios, offering a valuable contribution to advancing the field.

Abstract: The World Wide Web thrives on intelligent services that rely on accurate time series classification, which has recently witnessed significant progress driven by advances in deep learning. However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.

### [253] [Meta Dynamic Graph for Traffic Flow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10328)
*Yiqing Zou,Hanning Yuan,Qianyu Yang,Ziqiang Yuan,Shuliang Wang,Sijie Ruan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG), a framework for improved traffic flow prediction through modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of accurately modeling complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic flow prediction, especially overcoming limitations in handling spatial-temporal heterogeneity.

Method: The authors propose MetaDG, a framework that uses dynamic graph structures and generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters to model spatio-temporal dynamics holistically.

Result: Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaDG in improving traffic flow prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaDG enhances spatio-temporal prediction by effectively modeling dynamics and heterogeneity in a unified manner, overcoming previous limitations in the field.

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.

### [254] [SuS: Strategy-aware Surprise for Intrinsic Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10349)
*Mark Kashirskiy,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel intrinsic motivation framework called Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS) is proposed, improving reinforcement learning exploration by introducing Strategy Stability and Strategy Surprise components, leading to substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve exploration in reinforcement learning by addressing the limitations of curiosity-driven methods, which primarily rely on state prediction error without considering strategy-based behavioral consistency and unexpected outcomes.

Method: The framework introduces two components: Strategy Stability (SS) for measuring behavioral consistency across steps and Strategy Surprise (SuS) for identifying unexpected outcomes. A reward formulation combines these signals with learned weighting coefficients.

Result: Evaluation on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models shows a 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% in Pass@5 over baselines, with consistently higher strategy diversity. Ablation studies also validate the framework's synergistic design.

Conclusion: SuS proves effective in enhancing exploration in reinforcement learning tasks, demonstrating clear advantages over traditional methods and contributing to more accurate and diverse solutions.

Abstract: We propose Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a novel intrinsic motivation framework that uses pre-post prediction mismatch as a novelty signal for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.

### [255] [EvoMorph: Counterfactual Explanations for Continuous Time-Series Extrinsic Regression Applied to Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10356)
*Mesut Ceylan,Alexis Tabin,Patrick Langer,Elgar Fleisch,Filipe Barata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces EvoMorph, a novel framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse counterfactual explanations (CFE) for time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) applications in wearable PPG data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the trustworthiness and clinical interpretability of TSER models by addressing the current limitations in counterfactual explanations for biomedical time series, which often produce physiologically implausible results.

Method: The authors developed EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework that generates plausible and morphology-aware CFEs by optimizing signal descriptors and preserving waveform structure. It was tested on three PPG datasets and compared to a baseline method.

Result: EvoMorph generated physiologically-aware counterfactuals and showed its potential as a tool for uncertainty quantification, outperforming a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline in evaluations.

Conclusion: EvoMorph advances the generation of trustworthy and clinically interpretable counterfactual explanations for continuous biomedical time series, paving the way for more reliable TSER applications in healthcare.

Abstract: Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these "what-if" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.

*Jay Nandy,Arnab Kumar Mondal,Anuj Rathore,Mahesh Chandran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised graph condensation framework, PLGC, which optimizes small synthetic graphs without relying on ground-truth labels, demonstrating robustness under label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural network training on large datasets is computationally expensive, and existing graph condensation methods are unreliable under noisy or limited labels.

Method: PLGC constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings, optimizes condensed graphs to match structural and feature statistics, and jointly learns prototypes and node assignments.

Result: PLGC achieves competitive performance in clean datasets and exceeds existing approaches under label noise in tasks such as node classification and link prediction.

Conclusion: Self-supervised graph condensation via PLGC provides theoretical and empirical advantages, addressing noisy environments effectively without needing ground-truth labels.

Abstract: Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework enabling flexible control over generated distributions in discrete masked diffusion models, using Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discrete diffusion models lack flexible control over the sampled distribution during inference, hindering their full potential in specific applications.

Method: They introduce a control framework based on Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, allowing operations like annealing, combining marginals of different processes, and integrating external reward functions.

Result: The framework demonstrates success in various tasks, such as efficient sampling from the Ising model, enhancing code generation by language models, and reward-tilted protein sequence generation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables better control over discrete diffusion models' outputs without retraining, enhancing their flexibility and applicability in diverse domains.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive approach for generating discrete sequences. Sample generation via gradual denoising or demasking processes allows them to capture hierarchical non-sequential interdependencies in the data. These custom processes, however, do not assume a flexible control over the distribution of generated samples. We propose Discrete Feynman-Kac Correctors, a framework that allows for controlling the generated distribution of discrete masked diffusion models at inference time. We derive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms that, given a trained discrete diffusion model, control the temperature of the sampled distribution (i.e. perform annealing), sample from the product of marginals of several diffusion processes (e.g. differently conditioned processes), and sample from the product of the marginal with an external reward function, producing likely samples from the target distribution that also have high reward. Notably, our framework does not require any training of additional models or fine-tuning of the original model. We illustrate the utility of our framework in several applications including: efficient sampling from the annealed Boltzmann distribution of the Ising model, improving the performance of language models for code generation and amortized learning, as well as reward-tilted protein sequence generation.

*Yuanjie Zhao,Junnan Qiu,Yue Ding,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes CS-GBA, a novel backdoor attack for offline reinforcement learning that efficiently and stealthily targets constrained algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of offline reinforcement learning to backdoor attacks, especially against safety-constrained algorithms, and to enhance attack stealth and effectiveness.

Method: The method, CS-GBA, focuses on adaptive critical sample selection, correlation-breaking triggers for stealth, and gradient-guided action generation to maximize attack impact under a tight poisoning budget.

Result: The results show that CS-GBA outperforms existing baselines, achieving high attack success rates (even with a limited 5% poisoning budget) on D4RL benchmarks and maintaining clean environment performance.

Conclusion: CS-GBA presents an efficient and stealthy strategy for backdoor attacks in offline reinforcement learning, demonstrating its effectiveness against safety-constrained methods.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeFlow, an offline RL framework utilizing flow matching for complex behaviors, bypassing computational challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome computational limitations of optimizing generative policies in offline RL, aiming to improve stability and expressivity.

Method: The method involves using a lightweight refinement module within a trust region of the flow manifold, avoiding backpropagation through solvers.

Result: DeFlow achieves superior performance on the OGBench benchmark and efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

Conclusion: DeFlow offers a computationally efficient and stable framework for offline RL, maintaining expressivity and improving performance.

Abstract: We present DeFlow, a decoupled offline RL framework that leverages flow matching to faithfully capture complex behavior manifolds. Optimizing generative policies is computationally prohibitive, typically necessitating backpropagation through ODE solvers. We address this by learning a lightweight refinement module within an explicit, data-derived trust region of the flow manifold, rather than sacrificing the iterative generation capability via single-step distillation. This way, we bypass solver differentiation and eliminate the need for balancing loss terms, ensuring stable improvement while fully preserving the flow's iterative expressivity. Empirically, DeFlow achieves superior performance on the challenging OGBench benchmark and demonstrates efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

*Shenlong Zheng,Zhen Zhang,Yuhui Deng,Geyong Min,Lin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradESTC is a gradient compression technique for federated learning, reducing communication overhead significantly by leveraging spatial and temporal correlations of gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the challenge of high communication overhead in federated learning, especially in bandwidth-constrained networks.

Method: GradESTC utilizes both spatial and temporal gradient correlations to compress client gradients. It decomposes gradients into basis vectors and combination coefficients, updating only a limited portion of basis vectors dynamically during training.

Result: GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, achieving similar convergence speed and accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg.

Conclusion: GradESTC is an effective and scalable compression method that alleviates communication bottlenecks in federated learning while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address stability and optimization issues in policy learning during fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: Uses sequence-wise projection of gradients during microbatch accumulation, allowing precise updates without additional computational overhead.

Result: PROMA shows better local KL divergence control and avoids entropy collapse compared to existing methods like PPO and GRPO.

Conclusion: PROMA delivers stable fine-tuning without relying on reference policies or clipping mechanisms.

Abstract: This note introduces Projected Microbatch Accumulation (PROMA), a proximal policy update method for large language model fine-tuning. PROMA accumulates policy gradients across microbatches by projecting out sequence-wise gradient components before microbatch aggregation. The projection is applied layer-wise during the backward pass, enabling efficient implementation without additional forward or backward passes. Empirically, PROMA enforces tighter control of local KL divergence than GRPO, resulting in more stable policy learning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, PROMA achieves proximal updates without inducing entropy collapse and does not rely on a reference policy or likelihood-ratio clipping.

Conclusion: The study confirms the potential of using Transformer models to improve CR systems, offering advances in efficiency, robustness, and security for wireless communications.

Abstract: Cognitive Radio (CR) systems, which dynamically adapt to changing spectrum environments, could benefit significantly from advancements in machine learning technologies. These systems can be enhanced in terms of spectral efficiency, robustness, and security through innovative approaches such as the use of Transformer models. This work investigates the application of Transformer models, specifically the GPT-2 architecture, to generate novel modulation schemes for wireless communications. By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). The results show that Transformer-generated modulation schemes can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, traditional methods. This demonstrates that advanced CR systems could greatly benefit from the implementation of Transformer models, leading to more efficient, robust, and secure communication systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for machine learning model transparency, to address security and non-discrimination concerns.

Method: The proposed method learns both transparent labeling functions and the regions in the input space where the labeling function minimizes risk, using a multi-predictor loss function with PAC-Bayesian risk bounds.

Result: Tests with synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming other existing methods including some opaque models.

Conclusion: The proposed mixture of transparent local models effectively balances interpretability and predictive performance, offering a promising solution for transparent machine learning applications.

Abstract: The predominance of machine learning models in many spheres of human activity has led to a growing demand for their transparency. The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models. Keywords: PAC-Bayes, risk bounds, local models, transparent models, mixtures of local transparent models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the explainability and applicability of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) in scientific domains, addressing their lack of domain awareness and reliance on complete concept supervision.

Method: The authors propose PG-CBM, which integrates domain-defined causal mechanisms through intermediate biophysically meaningful concepts. It uses Earth Observation data to validate its approach.

Result: PG-CBM outperforms existing benchmarks by reducing error and bias while providing interpretable intermediate outputs and leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data.

Conclusion: PG-CBM improves accuracy, transparency, and trustworthiness in AI systems for scientific applications by aligning learning processes with domain-specific causal mechanisms.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) improve the explainability of black-box Deep Learning (DL) by introducing intermediate semantic concepts. However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.

We then develop a taxonomy of problem settings based on the form of uncertainty and decision structure. Using this taxonomy, we review algorithmic approaches for static and dynamic problems, survey applications across domains such as scheduling, vehicle routing, stochastic programming, and reinforcement learning, and synthesize methodological contributions in terms of empirical cost minimization, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. Finally, we identify key research frontiers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel probabilistic framework, ProbFM, for better uncertainty quantification in financial time-series forecasting, addressing limitations in current Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in uncertainty quantification for financial forecasting in TSFMs, as existing methods involve restrictive assumptions, conflate uncertainty sources, or lack proper calibration mechanisms.

Method: The proposed ProbFM framework utilizes a transformer-based architecture combined with Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to achieve explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition, avoiding pre-specified distributions or sampling-based inference.

Result: DER was extensively evaluated using an LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods in cryptocurrency forecasting. It showed competitive accuracy while providing explicit uncertainty decomposition.

Conclusion: ProbFM introduces a principled, extensible framework for uncertainty quantification, establishing DER's effectiveness in foundation models for financial applications.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of instability, inefficiency, and communication overhead that arise with fine-grained sparsity in Transformer models while achieving scalable parametric capacity.

Method: STEM replaces the dense up-projection layer in Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) with a static, token-indexed embedding lookup. It maintains dense gates and down-projections for stability and allows asynchronous prefetching and CPU offloading to reduce computational and communication costs.

Result: STEM maintains training stability despite extreme sparsity, improves downstream task performance, reduces approximately 33% of FFN parameters, and enhances interpretability and knowledge-editing capabilities. It also improves long-context performance by activating distinct parameters as the sequence length increases.

Conclusion: STEM achieves better efficiency, interpretability, and accuracy on knowledge and reasoning-heavy tasks, showing gains of up to ~3–4% in benchmarks at 350M and 1B scales. The approach provides a scalable and practical method to enhance parametric memory in Transformers.

Abstract: Fine-grained sparsity promises higher parametric capacity without proportional per-token compute, but often suffers from training instability, load balancing, and communication overhead. We introduce STEM (Scaling Transformers with Embedding Modules), a static, token-indexed approach that replaces the FFN up-projection with a layer-local embedding lookup while keeping the gate and down-projection dense. This removes runtime routing, enables CPU offload with asynchronous prefetch, and decouples capacity from both per-token FLOPs and cross-device communication. Empirically, STEM trains stably despite extreme sparsity. It improves downstream performance over dense baselines while reducing per-token FLOPs and parameter accesses (eliminating roughly one-third of FFN parameters). STEM learns embedding spaces with large angular spread which enhances its knowledge storage capacity. More interestingly, this enhanced knowledge capacity comes with better interpretability. The token-indexed nature of STEM embeddings allows simple ways to perform knowledge editing and knowledge injection in an interpretable manner without any intervention in the input text or additional computation. In addition, STEM strengthens long-context performance: as sequence length grows, more distinct parameters are activated, yielding practical test-time capacity scaling. Across 350M and 1B model scales, STEM delivers up to ~3--4% accuracy improvements overall, with notable gains on knowledge and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, OpenBookQA, GSM8K, MMLU). Overall, STEM is an effective way of scaling parametric memory while providing better interpretability, better training stability and improved efficiency.

### [269] [Single-Stage Huffman Encoder for ML Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10673)
*Aditya Agrawal,Albert Magyar,Hiteshwar Eswaraiah,Patrick Sheridan,Pradeep Janedula,Ravi Krishnan Venkatesan,Krishna Nair,Ravi Iyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single-stage Huffman encoder to optimize data compression for LLMs during latency-sensitive scenarios by using fixed codebooks, achieving near-optimal compression performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the network bandwidth bottleneck caused by frequent collective operations during the training and serving of LLMs. Traditional Huffman-based compression introduces prohibitive computational and data overheads which hinder performance in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Method: The authors propose a single-stage Huffman encoder that avoids overheads by utilizing fixed codebooks, derived from statistical analyses of historical data batches, to ensure efficient and lossless compression.

Result: The method achieves compression rates within 0.5% of the per-shard Huffman coding and 1% of the theoretical Shannon compressibility, demonstrating statistical similarity across layers and shards in the Gemma 2B model.

Conclusion: By employing fixed codebooks, the proposed method enables efficient on-the-fly data compression, alleviating network bottlenecks in LLMs without significant computational or latency overheads.

Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) require partitioning data across multiple accelerators, where collective operations are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using Huffman codes is an effective way to alleviate the issue, however, its three-stage design requiring on-the-fly frequency analysis, codebook generation and transmission of codebook along with data introduces computational, latency and data overheads which are prohibitive for latency-sensitive scenarios such as die-to-die communication. This paper proposes a single-stage Huffman encoder that eliminates these overheads by using fixed codebooks derived from the average probability distribution of previous data batches. Through our analysis of the Gemma 2B model, we demonstrate that tensors exhibit high statistical similarity across layers and shards. Using this approach we achieve compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and within 1% of the ideal Shannon compressibility, enabling efficient on-the-fly compression.

*Andrew F. Ilersich,Kevin Course,Prasanth B. Nair*

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic reduced-order models (ROMs) that generalize across parameter spaces with reduced computational demands and robust capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling complex dynamical systems with existing methods is computationally demanding, struggles with stochastic dynamics, and lacks robust uncertainty quantification, which limits their application in decision-making tasks.

Method: The approach employs amortized stochastic variational inference with a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes. This eliminates the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training, enabling the joint learning of a probabilistic autoencoder and latent dynamics as stochastic differential equations.

Result: The proposed framework shows superior generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcing conditions, with significant computational efficiency benefits demonstrated in three test problems.

Conclusion: This study presents a promising method for creating computationally efficient, flexible, and generalizable stochastic ROMs, with potential utility in various decision-making and predictive modeling scenarios.

Abstract: Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM) for federated learning, focusing on privacy protection and communication efficiency, and evaluates it through theoretical analysis and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore solutions to key challenges in federated learning, particularly ensuring communication efficiency and safeguarding privacy during collaborative training between multiple parties under data-governance restrictions.

Method: The paper uses the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which employs the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ). RSUQ is a randomized quantizer where quantization error simulates prescribed noise, enabling customizable privacy levels.

Result: CEPAM is theoretically analyzed for its privacy guarantees and convergence properties. Its performance is empirically evaluated through experimental results including utility, convergence profiles, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs.

Conclusion: The study validates CEPAM as an effective method for addressing communication efficiency and privacy concerns in federated learning, with favorable theoretical and experimental outcomes.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple parties to jointly train learning models without sharing their own underlying data, offering a practical pathway to privacy-preserving collaboration under data-governance constraints. Continued study of federated learning is essential to address key challenges in it, including communication efficiency and privacy protection between parties. A recent line of work introduced a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which achieves both objectives simultaneously. CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.

*Keval Jain,Anant Raj,Saurav Prakash,Girish Varma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the performance of semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron models for federated and distributed training using iterative parameter mixing. It addresses issues like stale updates, partial participation, and noisy communication, offering deterministic server-side aggregation rules and proving bounds on perceptron mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed and federated learning systems face challenges like stale updates, limited client participation, and communication noise, which degrade model performance. This paper aims to address these issues systematically.

Method: The proposed method introduces staleness-bucket aggregation, a deterministic server-side approach to managing update staleness while modeling intermittent client availability and noise as zero-mean additive terms.

Result: The paper establishes expected bounds for perceptron mistakes under staleness and noise conditions, showing the delay's impact depends on mean staleness, while noise contributes a cumulative term scaling with the square root of the training horizon.

Conclusion: Staleness-bucket aggregation effectively mitigates the detrimental effects of staleness and noise in federated perceptron training. The results demonstrate both finite stabilization and reduced mistakes under disruptive deployment conditions.

Abstract: We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.

*Khashayar Gatmiry,Sitan Chen,Adil Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new solver for diffusion models with complexity that scales polylogarithmically in accuracy, thus providing high-quality sampling efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models rely on iterative numerical methods for sampling, requiring numerous steps to achieve high-quality outputs, which scales polynomially with dimension and inverse accuracy.

Method: The authors propose a solver using a combination of low-degree approximation and collocation methods, improving sampling efficiency while relying on approximate access to data distribution scores.

Result: The study shows the solver achieves high-accuracy guarantees with polylogarithmic complexity in inverse accuracy, removing explicit dependence on ambient dimension.

Conclusion: The proposed solver significantly enhances the efficiency of generating accurate samples from diffusion models, advancing the state-of-the-art while mitigating dimension-dependent constraints.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in sampling from rich multi-modal distributions. Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \emph{high-quality} samples.
  More precisely, prior works have shown that the iteration complexity of discretization methods for diffusion models scales polynomially in the ambient dimension and the inverse accuracy $1/\varepsilon$. In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.

*Navami Kairanda,Shanthika Naik,Marc Habermann,Avinash Sharma,Christian Theobalt,Vladislav Golyanik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DInf-Grid, a novel differentiable grid-based approach for solving differential equations (DEs) efficiently, outperforming traditional MLP-based methods in speed while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural solvers for DEs using coordinate-based MLPs are computationally slow and inefficient, while existing grid-based methods relying on linear interpolation cannot compute higher-order derivatives effectively. A need exists for a fast, efficient solution with high accuracy.

Method: The proposed DInf-Grid combines feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable, and incorporates multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids to handle high-frequency solutions efficiently.

Result: DInf-Grid achieves 5-20x faster speeds compared to MLP-based methods while maintaining accuracy for solving differential equations, demonstrated through benchmark tasks including image reconstruction, wave fields, and cloth simulation.

Conclusion: DInf-Grid effectively balances computational efficiency and accuracy for solving DEs, making it a viable choice for practical applications in engineering and physics.

Abstract: We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.

Result: The architecture demonstrated efficient integration of computing components, showcasing enhanced robotic autonomy and human interaction capabilities in a musical instrument-playing task.

Conclusion: The study highlights the promise of heterogeneous computing systems for improving robotic intelligence and responsiveness, hinting at broader applications in smart city infrastructure.

Abstract: After Industry 4.0 has embraced tight integration between machinery (OT), software (IT), and the Internet, creating a web of sensors, data, and algorithms in service of efficient and reliable production, a new concept of Society 5.0 is emerging, in which infrastructure of a city will be instrumented to increase reliability, efficiency, and safety. Robotics will play a pivotal role in enabling this vision that is pioneered by the NEOM initiative - a smart city, co-inhabited by humans and robots. In this paper we explore the computing platform that will be required to enable this vision. We show how we can combine neuromorphic computing hardware, exemplified by the Loihi2 processor used in conjunction with event-based cameras, for sensing and real-time perception and interaction with a local AI compute cluster (GPUs) for high-level language processing, cognition, and task planning. We demonstrate the use of this hybrid computing architecture in an interactive task, in which a humanoid robot plays a musical instrument with a human. Central to our design is the efficient and seamless integration of disparate components, ensuring that the synergy between software and hardware maximizes overall performance and responsiveness. Our proposed system architecture underscores the potential of heterogeneous computing architectures in advancing robotic autonomy and interactive intelligence, pointing toward a future where such integrated systems become the norm in complex, real-time applications.

TL;DR: The paper presents a performance model for Intel's neuromorphic chip, Loihi 2, to predict runtimes by accounting for compute and communication processes, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of performance models for neuromorphic hardware that sufficiently predict runtimes and enable efficient design of algorithms, focusing on overcoming the memory bandwidth limitations of current architectures.

Method: Development of a multi-dimensional, max-affine runtime model based on microbenchmarks to analyze the compute and communication aspects of Intel Loihi 2 chip.

Result: The model demonstrates strong correlation (Pearson coefficient >= 0.97) with measured runtimes for specific workloads on Loihi 2, and provides insights into scalability and runtime tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The model facilitates the creation of efficient neuromorphic algorithms and highlights scalability considerations, enabling advancements in utilizing Loihi 2 hardware.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computers hold the potential to vastly improve the speed and efficiency of a wide range of computational kernels with their asynchronous, compute-memory co-located, spatially distributed, and scalable nature. However, performance models that are simple yet sufficiently expressive to predict runtime on actual neuromorphic hardware are lacking, posing a challenge for researchers and developers who strive to design fast algorithms and kernels. As breaking the memory bandwidth wall of conventional von-Neumann architectures is a primary neuromorphic advantage, modeling communication time is especially important. At the same time, modeling communication time is difficult, as complex congestion patterns arise in a heavily-loaded Network-on-Chip. In this work, we introduce the first max-affine lower-bound runtime model -- a multi-dimensional roofline model -- for Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip that quantitatively accounts for both compute and communication based on a suite of microbenchmarks. Despite being a lower-bound model, we observe a tight correspondence (Pearson correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.97) between our model's estimated runtime and the measured runtime on Loihi 2 for a neural network linear layer, i.e., matrix-vector multiplication, and for an example application, a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization solver. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for communication-bottlenecked runtime to study scalability of the linear layer, revealing an area-runtime tradeoff for different spatial workload configurations with linear to superliner runtime scaling in layer size with a variety of constant factors. Our max-affine runtime model helps empower the design of high-speed algorithms and kernels for Loihi 2.

Abstract: This study proposes MCEMOL (Multi-Constrained Evolutionary Molecular Design Framework), a molecular optimization approach integrating rule-based evolution with molecular crossover. MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution: optimizing transformation rules at rule level while applying crossover and mutation to molecular structures. Unlike deep learning methods requiring large datasets and extensive training, our algorithm evolves efficiently from minimal starting molecules with low computational overhead. The framework incorporates message-passing neural networks and comprehensive chemical constraints, ensuring efficient and interpretable molecular design. Experimental results demonstrate that MCEMOL provides transparent design pathways through its evolutionary mechanism while generating valid, diverse, target-compliant molecules. The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with high structural diversity and excellent drug-likeness compliance, showing strong performance in symmetry constraints, pharmacophore optimization, and stereochemical integrity. Unlike black-box methods, MCEMOL delivers dual value: interpretable transformation rules researchers can understand and trust, alongside high-quality molecular libraries for practical applications. This establishes a paradigm where interpretable AI-driven drug design and effective molecular generation are achieved simultaneously, bridging the gap between computational innovation and practical drug discovery needs.

Motivation: To improve performance in long-term search for real parameter single objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms.

Method: Enhance EA4eig by adding crisscross search and sparrow search as secondary algorithms to handle inferior individuals, aiming to break stagnation in population distribution.

Result: EA4eigCS significantly outperforms EA4eig and is competitive with other leading algorithms.

Conclusion: EA4eigCS is an effective approach for long-term optimization due to its ability to vary population distribution and overcome stagnation.

Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, real parameter single objective optimization is an important direction. Both the Differential Evolution (DE) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) demonstrate good performance for real parameter single objective optimization. Nevertheless, there exist other types of evolutionary algorithm for the purpose. In recent years, researchers begin to study long-term search. EA4eig - an ensemble of three DE variants and CMA-ES - performs well for long-term search. In this paper, we introduce two types of evolutionary algorithm proposed recently - crisscross search and sparrow search - into EA4eig as secondary evolutionary algorithms to process inferior individuals. Thus, EA4eigCS is obtained. In our ensemble, the secondary evolutionary algorithms are expected to vary distribution of the population for breaking stagnation. Experimental results show that our EA4eigCS outperforms EA4eig and is competitive when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-assisted systems lack a systematic approach to guide evolutionary search, facing issues like experiment bias, poor exploration-exploitation balance, and ineffective collaboration.

Method: PACEvolve integrates hierarchical context management (HCM), momentum-based backtracking (MBB), and self-adaptive sampling for addressing key shortcomings in the evolutionary process.

Result: PACEvolve outperformed existing methods, setting benchmarks on LLM-SR and KernelBench and surpassing prior achievements on Modded NanoGPT.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust and systematic approach, fostering consistent and effective long-horizon self-improvement in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the systemic challenges of ED overcrowding and patient boarding, which degrade care quality.

Method: The study models the ED as a two-class $M/M/c$ queue system where patient priorities govern redirection. A Quasi-Birth-Death process is used to derive optimal thresholds using an objective function balancing revenue, costs, and system performance.

Result: The analysis, guided by national healthcare data, shows context-specific thresholds for rural and urban EDs, optimizing operational efficiency with significant performance gains (up to 4.84% for rural and 5.90% for urban settings).

Conclusion: This threshold-based redirection policy provides a rigorous, adaptable framework for enhancing both clinical care and the operational efficiency of EDs in diverse settings.

Abstract: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding and patient boarding represent critical systemic challenges that compromise care quality. We propose a threshold-based admission policy that redirects non-urgent patients to alternative care pathways, such as telemedicine, during peak congestion. The ED is modeled as a two-class $M/M/c$ preemptive-priority queuing system, where high-acuity patients are prioritized and low-acuity patients are subject to state-dependent redirection. Analyzed via a level-dependent Quasi-Birth-Death (QBD) process, the model determines the optimal threshold by maximizing a long-run time-averaged objective function comprising redirection-affected revenue and costs associated with patient balking and system occupancy. Numerical analysis using national healthcare data reveals that optimal policies are highly context-dependent. While rural EDs generally optimize at lower redirection thresholds, urban EDs exhibit performance peaks at moderate thresholds. Results indicate that our optimal policy yields significant performance gains of up to $4.84\%$ in rural settings and $5.90\%$ in urban environments. This research provides a mathematically rigorous framework for balancing clinical priority with operational efficiency across diverse ED settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the hidden causes of latency variance at the application level caused by kernel and hardware events and provide a comprehensive analysis framework.

Method: Developed VarMRI, a tool that selectively records events affecting application latency, prioritizing relevant and coarse-grained data, and introduces an efficient and robust analysis method.

Result: Using VarMRI, a 3,000-hour study revealed various latency-affecting events such as interrupt preemption and NUMA balancing, alongside optimization techniques that reduced tail latencies by up to 31%.

Conclusion: Long-term monitoring is vital to detect critical kernel and hardware events causing latency variance, and simple optimization can effectively reduce application-level latencies.

Abstract: This paper presents our experience to understand latency variance caused by kernel and hardware events, which are often invisible at the application level. For this purpose, we have built VarMRI, a tool chain to monitor and analyze those events in the long term. To mitigate the "big data" problem caused by long-term monitoring, VarMRI selectively records a subset of events following two principles: it only records events that are affecting the requests recorded by the application; it records coarse-grained information first and records additional information only when necessary. Furthermore, VarMRI introduces an analysis method that is efficient on large amount of data, robust on different data set and against missing data, and informative to the user.
  VarMRI has helped us to carry out a 3,000-hour study of six applications and benchmarks on CloudLab. It reveals a wide variety of events causing latency variance, including interrupt preemption, Java GC, pipeline stall, NUMA balancing etc.; simple optimization or tuning can reduce tail latencies by up to 31%. Furthermore, the impacts of some of these events vary significantly across different experiments, which confirms the necessity of long-term monitoring.

Conclusion: The paper equips programmers with the knowledge to manage variables efficiently in SAS and R, leading to improved debugging and coding practices.

Abstract: Variable scoping dictates how and where variables are accessible within programming languages, playing a crucial role in code efficiency and organization. This paper examines the distinct scoping rules in SAS and R, focusing on SAS's dynamic scoping and R's lexical scoping. In SAS, dynamic scoping utilizes symbol tables, resolving variables at runtime by dynamically searching through active macro layers. R, in contrast, employs lexical scoping, using environments to resolve variables based on the structure in which functions are defined. Illustrative examples highlight the differences between these scoping strategies, showcasing their impact on code behavior. Additionally, the paper outlines methods for inspecting variables in SAS's symbol tables and R's environments, offering practical insights for debugging and optimization. Strategies for controlling variable scope in both languages are discussed, enhancing code precision and reliability. This exploration equips programmers with critical understanding to optimize variable management, improving their programming practices in SAS and R.

### [284] [Lazy Evaluation: A Comparative Analysis of SAS MACROs and R Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09839)
*Chen Ling,Yachen Wang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper explores and compares lazy evaluation mechanisms in SAS MACROs and R functions, detailing their principles, differences, and impact on programming efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate and compare the mechanisms of lazy evaluation in SAS and R to promote better understanding and optimization of programming code, especially as the use of R grows in the pharmaceutical industry.

Method: The paper conducts a conceptual and practical comparative analysis of lazy evaluation mechanisms in SAS MACROs and R functions, demonstrating their differences through illustrative examples.

Result: The study highlights two distinct lazy evaluation approaches: R utilizes Promises and a call-by-need strategy, whereas SAS employs symbol tables and a call-by-name mechanism. These differences significantly impact programming efficiency.

Conclusion: Understanding the differences in lazy evaluation between SAS and R can help programmers optimize their workflows and improve programming efficacy, particularly for those transitioning from SAS to R in fields like pharmaceuticals.

Abstract: Lazy evaluation is a powerful technique that can optimize code execution by deferring evaluations until their results are required, thus enhancing efficiency. In most modern programming languages, like R, lazy evaluation is commonly applied to function arguments. However, the application of lazy evaluation in SAS has not been extensively explored. This paper focuses on the mechanisms of lazy evaluation in SAS MACROs and R functions, offering a comparative analysis of the underlying principles that drive these processes.
  R's lazy evaluation is driven by a data structure called Promise, which postpones evaluation and does not occupy memory until the value is needed, utilizing a call-by-need strategy. SAS, on the other hand, achieves lazy evaluation through its symbol tables, employing memory to store parameters, and operates on a call-by-name basis. These discrepancies in lazy evaluation strategies can notably impact the results of R functions and SAS MACROs. By examining these distinct approaches, the paper illuminates the impact of lazy evaluation on programming efficiency, supported by illustrative examples. As the shift from SAS to R becomes increasingly prevalent in the pharmaceutical industry, understanding these techniques enables programmers to optimize their code for greater efficacy. This exploration serves as a guide to enhance programming capabilities and performance in both languages.

TL;DR: The paper presents a safety framework for autonomous vehicles, combining Barrier Certificates (BCs) with Time-to-Collision (TTC) metrics to address safety challenges in mixed traffic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety and interpretability of autonomous driving systems, addressing their black-box nature and ensuring reliable operation in dynamic, uncertain traffic conditions.

Method: The framework integrates Barrier Certificates with spatio-temporal metrics like Time-to-Collision. Safety is verified with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures compliance in real-time.

Result: Evaluation on real-world highway datasets reduced unsafe interactions by up to 40% with no conflicts in certain lanes, proving the efficacy and scalability of the approach.

Conclusion: The presented framework offers interpretable and scientifically verified safety guarantees, marking a significant step forward in the safe deployment of autonomous driving technologies.

Abstract: Modern AI technologies enable autonomous vehicles to perceive complex scenes, predict human behavior, and make real-time driving decisions. However, these data-driven components often operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Autonomous vehicles operate in dynamic, mixed-traffic environments where interactions with human-driven vehicles introduce uncertainty and safety challenges. This work develops a formally verified safety framework for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) that integrates Barrier Certificates (BCs) with interpretable traffic conflict metrics, specifically Time-to-Collision (TTC) as a spatio-temporal safety metric. Safety conditions are verified using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, and an adaptive control mechanism ensures vehicles comply with these constraints in real time. Evaluation on real-world highway datasets shows a significant reduction in unsafe interactions, with up to 40\% fewer events where TTC falls below a 3 seconds threshold, and complete elimination of conflicts in some lanes. This approach provides both interpretable and provable safety guarantees, demonstrating a practical and scalable strategy for safe autonomous driving.

*Andrew Stratton,Phani Teja Singamaneni,Pranav Goyal,Rachid Alami,Christoforos Mavrogiannis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of human motion prediction on robot navigation in dynamic, constrained environments, highlighting challenges like stochastic human behavior and limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to integrate mobile robots closer to humans in environments like warehouses, hospitals, and homes, ensuring safety, comfort, and efficiency.

Method: A user study was conducted with 80 participants in a constrained workspace using two robot platforms across two global sites, focusing on human motion prediction and robot navigation.

Result: Key findings reveal that average displacement error isn't a reliable metric, human cooperation assumptions fail in constrained areas, and efficient robot navigation can reduce human comfort and efficiency.

Conclusion: Human motion prediction quality significantly influences robot navigation in dynamic environments, requiring reevaluation of predictive metrics and assumptions for improved human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Motivated by the vision of integrating mobile robots closer to humans in warehouses, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and the home, we focus on robot navigation in dynamic and spatially constrained environments. Ensuring human safety, comfort, and efficiency in such settings requires that robots are endowed with a model of how humans move around them. Human motion prediction around robots is especially challenging due to the stochasticity of human behavior, differences in user preferences, and data scarcity. In this work, we perform a methodical investigation of the effects of human motion prediction quality on robot navigation performance, as well as human productivity and impressions. We design a scenario involving robot navigation among two human subjects in a constrained workspace and instantiate it in a user study ($N=80$) involving two different robot platforms, conducted across two sites from different world regions. Key findings include evidence that: 1) the widely adopted average displacement error is not a reliable predictor of robot navigation performance and human impressions; 2) the common assumption of human cooperation breaks down in constrained environments, with users often not reciprocating robot cooperation, and causing performance degradations; 3) more efficient robot navigation often comes at the expense of human efficiency and comfort.

Method: The approach includes 3D reconstruction using VGGT, real-time object state tracking, and simulation synchronization for motion planning.

Result: SyncTwin enhances grasp accuracy and safety in dynamic and visually occluded settings through its synchronization framework.

Conclusion: Digital twin synchronization significantly improves robotic performance in real-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and safe grasping under dynamic and visually occluded conditions remains a core challenge in real-world robotic manipulation. We present SyncTwin, a digital twin framework that unifies fast 3D scene reconstruction and real-to-sim synchronization for robust and safety-aware grasping in such environments. In the offline stage, we employ VGGT to rapidly reconstruct object-level 3D assets from RGB images, forming a reusable geometry library for simulation. During execution, SyncTwin continuously synchronizes the digital twin by tracking real-world object states via point cloud segmentation updates and aligning them through colored-ICP registration. The updated twin enables motion planners to compute collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories in simulation, which are safely executed on the real robot through a closed real-to-sim-to-real loop. Experiments in dynamic and occluded scenes show that SyncTwin improves grasp accuracy and motion safety, demonstrating the effectiveness of digital-twin synchronization for real-world robotic execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulation tasks often require precise force control to avoid task failure or object damage. Existing force sensors are costly, bulky, and fragile, limiting widespread adoption.

Method: UMI-FT integrates six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger alongside RGB, depth, and pose data. It uses this multimodal data for training adaptive compliance policies to execute on standard compliance controllers.

Result: The method achieves improved performance in three force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, zucchini skewering, and lightbulb insertion), surpassing baselines lacking compliance or force sensing.

Conclusion: UMI-FT enables scalable, force-aware policy learning for manipulation tasks and is open-sourced to facilitate broader adoption and further research.

Abstract: Many manipulation tasks require careful force modulation. With insufficient force the task may fail, while excessive force could cause damage. The high cost, bulky size and fragility of commercial force/torque (F/T) sensors have limited large-scale, force-aware policy learning. We introduce UMI-FT, a handheld data-collection platform that mounts compact, six-axis force/torque sensors on each finger, enabling finger-level wrench measurements alongside RGB, depth, and pose. Using the multimodal data collected from this device, we train an adaptive compliance policy that predicts position targets, grasp force, and stiffness for execution on standard compliance controllers. In evaluations on three contact-rich, force-sensitive tasks (whiteboard wiping, skewering zucchini, and lightbulb insertion), UMI-FT enables policies that reliably regulate external contact forces and internal grasp forces, outperforming baselines that lack compliance or force sensing. UMI-FT offers a scalable path to learning compliant manipulation from in-the-wild demonstrations. We open-source the hardware and software to facilitate broader adoption at:https://umi-ft.github.io/.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study introduces CoCoPlan, a framework for multi-robot systems to optimize task planning and communication under limited communication conditions, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the efficiency of multi-robot systems under limited communication conditions, as current methods struggle with dynamic task distributions and communication constraints.

Method: The paper presents CoCoPlan, a framework that integrates a branch-and-bound architecture for task and communication planning, an adaptive objective function to balance task efficiency and communication latency, and a module to optimize global connectivity events.

Result: CoCoPlan achieves a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reduces communication overhead by 58.6%, and supports scalability with up to 100 robots in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: CoCoPlan significantly improves the performance of multi-robot systems, addressing the limitations of existing methods, and proves effective in real-world experiments and complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems can greatly enhance efficiency through coordination and collaboration, yet in practice, full-time communication is rarely available and interactions are constrained to close-range exchanges. Existing methods either maintain all-time connectivity, rely on fixed schedules, or adopt pairwise protocols, but none adapt effectively to dynamic spatio-temporal task distributions under limited communication, resulting in suboptimal coordination. To address this gap, we propose CoCoPlan, a unified framework that co-optimizes collaborative task planning and team-wise intermittent communication. Our approach integrates a branch-and-bound architecture that jointly encodes task assignments and communication events, an adaptive objective function that balances task efficiency against communication latency, and a communication event optimization module that strategically determines when, where and how the global connectivity should be re-established. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a 22.4% higher task completion rate, reducing communication overhead by 58.6%, and improving the scalability by supporting up to 100 robots in dynamic environments. Hardware experiments include the complex 2D office environment and large-scale 3D disaster-response scenario.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gantry-based 3D printing systems lack mobility, while mobile platforms cannot maintain precise printing, especially on unstructured, uneven terrains.

Method: The proposed method uses a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. AI predicts disturbances using IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation. A three-layer control architecture coordinates path planning, chassis-manipulator interaction, and precise hardware execution.

Result: Outdoor experiments on irregular terrains (including slopes and uneven surfaces) achieved sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining platform mobility.

Conclusion: This integrated AI and hardware framework enables accurate mobile 3D printing on complex terrains, offering a foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Mobile 3D printing on unstructured terrain remains challenging due to the conflict between platform mobility and deposition precision. Existing gantry-based systems achieve high accuracy but lack mobility, while mobile platforms struggle to maintain print quality on uneven ground. We present a framework that tightly integrates AI-driven disturbance prediction with multi-modal sensor fusion and hierarchical hardware control, forming a closed-loop perception-learning-actuation system. The AI module learns terrain-to-perturbation mappings from IMU, vision, and depth sensors, enabling proactive compensation rather than reactive correction. This intelligence is embedded into a three-layer control architecture: path planning, predictive chassis-manipulator coordination, and precision hardware execution. Through outdoor experiments on terrain with slopes and surface irregularities, we demonstrate sub-centimeter printing accuracy while maintaining full platform mobility. This AI-hardware integration establishes a practical foundation for autonomous construction in unstructured environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified kinematic analysis method for origami-inspired rigid foldable structures (RFS) using an automated approach that constructs Pfaffian constraint matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid origami-inspired structures have evolved in complexity (e.g., thick, kirigami, multi-sheet forms), requiring a universal method to systematically address their kinematic constraints for practical application and study.

Method: An automated framework is proposed that creates the facet-hinge graph, extracts a minimum cycle basis, and uses screw theory to formulate velocity-level Pfaffian constraint matrices for RFS.

Result: The developed system streamlines constraint calculations by automating the creation of kinematic models, allowing efficient computation and visualization of fold and deploy motions for diverse structures.

Conclusion: This paper resolves the tedious and error-prone process of manually analyzing rigid foldable structures by providing an automated, generalizable kinematic analysis approach.

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures with rigid panels now span thick, kirigami, and multi-sheet realizations, making unified kinematic analysis essential. Yet a general method that consolidates their loop constraints has been lacking. We present an automated approach that generates the Pfaffian constraint matrix for arbitrary rigid foldable structures (RFS). From a minimally extended data schema, the tool constructs the facet-hinge graph, extracts a minimum cycle basis that captures all constraints, and assembles a velocity-level constraint matrix via screw theory that encodes coupled rotation and translation loop closure. The framework computes and visualizes deploy and fold motions across diverse RFS while eliminating tedious and error-prone constraint calculations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of reactive safe controllers, like Control Barrier Functions, which rely solely on real-time obstacle states and risk future collisions in dynamic environments.

Method: The method utilizes Gaussian processes and neural networks to learn barrier functions online from motion predictions of obstacles. These learned functions are integrated into modulated Control Barrier Functions (MCBFs) for safe and efficient navigation.

Result: The proposed framework was tested in simulations and real-world environments, outperforming existing methods in safety and efficiency, particularly in crowded and dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: The study presents an innovative combination of online learning of barrier functions and adaptive modulation techniques, offering a significant advancement in safe and efficient robot navigation in challenging environments.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of safe and efficient mobile robot navigation in complex dynamic environments with concave moving obstacles. Reactive safe controllers like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) design obstacle avoidance strategies based only on the current states of the obstacles, risking future collisions. To alleviate this problem, we use Gaussian processes to learn barrier functions online from multimodal motion predictions of obstacles generated by neural networks trained with energy-based learning. The learned barrier functions are then fed into quadratic programs using modulated CBFs (MCBFs), a local-minimum-free version of CBFs, to achieve safe and efficient navigation. The proposed framework makes two key contributions. First, it develops a prediction-to-barrier function online learning pipeline. Second, it introduces an autonomous parameter tuning algorithm that adapts MCBFs to deforming, prediction-based barrier functions. The framework is evaluated in both simulations and real-world experiments, consistently outperforming baselines and demonstrating superior safety and efficiency in crowded dynamic environments.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes different tactile sensor configurations for robotic hands using simulations to measure their impact on reinforcement learning and identifies the most effective layout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance grasp stability in robotic hands, especially prosthetics, by evaluating the optimal tactile sensor arrangements on the hand surface.

Method: Simulations were used to test six different tactile sensor configurations in various densities and layouts across two setups to ensure consistency across different physics simulators and machine learning algorithms.

Result: The study identified setup-specific and generalized effects for the sensor configurations, highlighting one layout yielding the best overall performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into effective tactile sensor configurations, aiding future designs of robotic hands and prosthetics.

Abstract: Tactile sensors are breaking into the field of robotics to provide direct information related to contact surfaces, including contact events, slip events and even texture identification. These events are especially important for robotic hand designs, including prosthetics, as they can greatly improve grasp stability. Most presently published robotic hand designs, however, implement them in vastly different densities and layouts on the hand surface, often reserving the majority of the available space. We used simulations to evaluate 6 different tactile sensor configurations with different densities and layouts, based on their impact on reinforcement learning. Our two-setup system allows for robust results that are not dependent on the use of a given physics simulator, robotic hand model or machine learning algorithm. Our results show setup-specific, as well as generalized effects across the 6 sensorized simulations, and we identify one configuration as consistently yielding the best performance across both setups. These results could help future research aimed at robotic hand designs, including prostheses.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces CHORAL, a framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots for better navigation and task execution using a semantic-aware approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with various capabilities can improve performance in navigating and inspecting complex environments, but current methods lack full integration of semantic scene understanding into routing decisions.

Method: The authors propose CHORAL, a framework that builds a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models from reconnaissance flights, identifies areas needing inspection, and optimizes robot routing and task assignment based on capabilities.

Result: Simulation and a real-world inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate that CHORAL plans safer and more efficient routes by leveraging explicit navigation capabilities of each platform.

Conclusion: CHORAL improves mission outcomes by combining semantic scene understanding and task optimization for heterogeneous robot teams. The framework is open-sourced to promote further applications and reproducibility.

Abstract: Monitoring large, unknown, and complex environments with autonomous robots poses significant navigation challenges, where deploying teams of heterogeneous robots with complementary capabilities can substantially improve both mission performance and feasibility. However, effectively modeling how different robotic platforms interact with the environment requires rich, semantic scene understanding. Despite this, existing approaches often assume homogeneous robot teams or focus on discrete task compatibility rather than continuous routing. Consequently, scene understanding is not fully integrated into routing decisions, limiting their ability to adapt to the environment and to leverage each robot's strengths. In this paper, we propose an integrated semantic-aware framework for coordinating heterogeneous robots. Starting from a reconnaissance flight, we build a metric-semantic map using open-vocabulary vision models and use it to identify regions requiring closer inspection and capability-aware paths for each platform to reach them. These are then incorporated into a heterogeneous vehicle routing formulation that jointly assigns inspection tasks and computes robot trajectories. Experiments in simulation and in a real inspection mission with three robotic platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning safer and more efficient routes by explicitly accounting for each platform's navigation capabilities. We release our framework, CHORAL, as open source to support reproducibility and deployment of diverse robot teams.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents FastStair, a framework enabling humanoid robots to ascend stairs quickly and stably, integrating model-based planning with reinforcement learning for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of enabling humanoid robots to perform high-speed and stable stair ascension, given the difficulties posed by the need for both agility and stability.

Method: The method combines model-based foothold planners with reinforcement learning (RL). The model-based planner biases the RL training, pre-trains a safety-focused base policy, fine-tunes speed-specific experts, and integrates them using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Result: Achieved stable stair climbing at speeds up to 1.65 m/s on the Oli humanoid robot, traversing a 33-step spiral staircase in 12 seconds. This was also the winning approach in a robot competition.

Conclusion: FastStair successfully reconciles the strengths of model-based planning and reinforcement learning, enabling robust and high-speed stair climbing for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Running up stairs is effortless for humans but remains extremely challenging for humanoid robots due to the simultaneous requirements of high agility and strict stability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can generate dynamic locomotion, yet implicit stability rewards and heavy reliance on task-specific reward shaping tend to result in unsafe behaviors, especially on stairs; conversely, model-based foothold planners encode contact feasibility and stability structure, but enforcing their hard constraints often induces conservative motion that limits speed. We present FastStair, a planner-guided, multi-stage learning framework that reconciles these complementary strengths to achieve fast and stable stair ascent. FastStair integrates a parallel model-based foothold planner into the RL training loop to bias exploration toward dynamically feasible contacts and to pretrain a safety-focused base policy. To mitigate planner-induced conservatism and the discrepancy between low- and high-speed action distributions, the base policy was fine-tuned into speed-specialized experts and then integrated via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable smooth operation across the full commanded-speed range. We deploy the resulting controller on the Oli humanoid robot, achieving stable stair ascent at commanded speeds up to 1.65 m/s and traversing a 33-step spiral staircase (17 cm rise per step) in 12 s, demonstrating robust high-speed performance on long staircases. Notably, the proposed approach served as the champion solution in the Canton Tower Robot Run Up Competition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning framework for real-time monitoring and adaptive predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, addressing challenges of accuracy, interpretability, and adaptiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing techniques fall short of simultaneously achieving predictive accuracy, interpretability, and online adaptability required for Digital Twins in complex systems.

Method: The paper presents a unified probabilistic state-space model using sparse horseshoe priors for online symbolic discovery, coupled with a recursive algorithm and convergence guarantees.

Result: The framework achieves interpretable probabilistic prediction, effective uncertainty quantification, robust system identification, and real-time adaptiveness, confirmed via case studies.

Conclusion: The proposed BRSL framework successfully bridges gaps in current techniques, paving the way for improved real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance with Digital Twins.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), serving as the core enablers for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of complex cyber-physical systems, impose critical requirements on their virtual models: high predictive accuracy, strong interpretability, and online adaptive capability. However, existing techniques struggle to meet these demands simultaneously: Bayesian methods excel in uncertainty quantification but lack model interpretability, while interpretable symbolic identification methods (e.g., SINDy) are constrained by their offline, batch-processing nature, which make real-time updates challenging. To bridge this semantic and computational gap, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Regression-based Symbolic Learning (BRSL) framework. The framework formulates online symbolic discovery as a unified probabilistic state-space model. By incorporating sparse horseshoe priors, model selection is transformed into a Bayesian inference task, enabling simultaneous system identification and uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we derive an online recursive algorithm with a forgetting factor and establish precise recursive conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of the posterior distribution. These conditions also function as real-time monitors for data utility, enhancing algorithmic robustness. Additionally, a rigorous convergence analysis is provided, demonstrating the convergence of parameter estimates under persistent excitation conditions. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving interpretable, probabilistic prediction and online learning.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a federated governance model for IoT data management in manufacturing, addressing challenges in distributed ownership and continuous edge changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises face systemic governance challenges in handling IoT data at scale due to disconnected operational ownership, diverse systems, and dynamic changes.

Method: The paper introduces a federated governance model emphasizing contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability.

Result: The model supports semantic consistency, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance without the need for centralized control over operational systems.

Conclusion: This systems architecture and design framework is tailored to manufacturing IoT requirements but requires future empirical validation.

Abstract: Industrial IoT platforms in global manufacturing environments generate continuous operational data across production assets, utilities, and connected products. While data ingestion and storage capabilities have matured significantly, enterprises continue to face systemic challenges in governing IoT data at scale. These challenges are not rooted in tooling limitations but in the absence of a governance model that aligns with the realities of distributed operational ownership, heterogeneous source systems, and continuous change at the edge. This paper presents a federated governance model that emphasizes contract-driven interoperability, policy-as-code enforcement, and asset-centric accountability across global manufacturing organizations. The model addresses governance enforcement at architectural boundaries, enabling semantic consistency, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance without requiring centralized control of operational technology systems. This work contributes a systems architecture and design framework grounded in analysis of manufacturing IoT requirements and constraints; empirical validation remains future work

*Antonio Abu Nassar,Eitan Farchi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper suggests utilizing AI to reduce the complexity of formal software specification, while retaining its benefits, through natural language and lightweight notation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal software specification is valuable for early error detection and defining explicit invariants but suffers limited adoption due to the expertise and overhead required.

Method: A case study employs natural language augmented with lightweight mathematical notations in LaTeX, refined by AI for specification prior to code generation.

Result: Applying this approach to a simulation of organizational knowledge growth enabled early validation, clear invariants, reduced development effort, and correct implementation on the first attempt.

Conclusion: Recent AI advances make formal specification more accessible and practical, fostering industrial adoption by reducing costs and complexity.

Abstract: Formal software specification is known to enable early error detection and explicit invariants, yet it has seen limited industrial adoption due to its high notation overhead and the expertise required to use traditional formal languages. This paper presents a case study showing that recent advances in artificial intelligence make it possible to retain many of the benefits of formal specification while substantially reducing these costs. The necessity of a clear distinction between what is controlled by the system analyst and can highly benefits from the rigor of formal specification and what need not be controlled is demonstrated. We use natural language augmented with lightweight mathematical notation and written in \LaTeX\ as an intermediate specification language, which is reviewed and refined by AI prior to code generation. Applied to a nontrivial simulation of organizational knowledge growth, this approach enables early validation, explicit invariants, and correctness by design, while significantly reducing development effort and producing a correct implementation on the first attempt.

### [302] [R-LAM: Reproducibility-Constrained Large Action Models for Scientific Workflow Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09749)
*Suriya Sureshkumar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents R-LAM, a reproducibility-focused framework for Large Action Models (LAMs) aimed at automating scientific workflows while ensuring reproducibility and auditability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LAMs lack reproducibility, auditability, and deterministic execution, making them inadequate for scientific workflows that require strict reproducibility and reliability standards.

Method: R-LAM introduces structured action schemas, deterministic execution policies, and provenance tracking, alongside features like failure-aware execution loops. It is implemented as an open-source Python package.

Result: R-LAM improves reproducibility success rates and execution reliability in scientific workflows, outperforming unconstrained LLM-based alternatives.

Conclusion: R-LAM enables reproducible and audit-friendly scientific workflow automation, balancing adaptive control with strict reproducibility requirements.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) extend large language models by enabling autonomous decision-making and tool execution, making them promising for automating scientific workflows. However, scientific workflows impose strict requirements on reproducibility, auditability, and deterministic execution, which are not satisfied by generic LLM-based agents. Unconstrained action generation can lead to silent state changes, non-deterministic executions, and irreproducible experimental results, limiting the applicability of LAMs in scientific settings.
  In this paper, we propose R-LAM, a reproducibility-constrained framework for applying Large Action Models to scientific workflow automation. R-LAM introduces structured action schemas, deterministic execution policies, and explicit provenance tracking to ensure that every action and intermediate artifact is auditable and replayable. The framework supports failure-aware execution loops and controlled workflow forking, enabling iterative experimentation without compromising reproducibility.
  We implement R-LAM as a lightweight Python framework and release it as an open-source PyPI package to facilitate reproducible research. An experimental evaluation of representative scientific workflows demonstrates that R-LAM improves reproducibility success rates and execution reliability compared to unconstrained LLM-based agents, while retaining adaptive control over workflow execution.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGE, a conversational AI based on OPACA framework, which allows dynamic integration of tools to extend LLM functionality with modular methods for task-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the integration process for rapidly evolving tools and services into LLMs while addressing challenges with domain-specific custom tools.

Method: Development of SAGE, integrated with OPACA framework, enabling extensibility, modular switching between different LLMs, and employing zero-shot prompting methods for tool usage.

Result: Promising results from evaluations on benchmark services, showcasing strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies.

Conclusion: The SAGE system enhances dynamic tool integration in LLMs, provides robust task-solving strategies, and showcases the utility of modular and scalable AI interfaces.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to work well in question-answering scenarios, but real-world applications often require access to tools for live information or actuation. For this, LLMs can be extended with tools, which are often defined in advance, also allowing for some fine-tuning for specific use cases. However, rapidly evolving software landscapes and individual services require the constant development and integration of new tools. Domain- or company-specific tools can greatly elevate the usefulness of an LLM, but such custom tools can be problematic to integrate, or the LLM may fail to reliably understand and use them. For this, we need strategies to define new tools and integrate them into the LLM dynamically, as well as robust and scalable zero-shot prompting methods that can make use of those tools in an efficient manner. In this paper, we present SAGE, a specialized conversational AI interface, based on the OPACA framework for tool discovery and execution. The integration with OPACA makes it easy to add new tools or services for the LLM to use, while SAGE itself presents rich extensibility and modularity. This not only provides the ability to seamlessly switch between different models (e.g. GPT, LLAMA), but also to add and select prompting methods, involving various setups of differently prompted agents for selecting and executing tools and evaluating the results. We implemented a number of task-solving strategies, making use of agentic concepts and prompting methods in various degrees of complexity, and evaluated those against a comprehensive set of benchmark services. The results are promising and highlight the distinct strengths and weaknesses of different task-solving strategies. Both SAGE and the OPACA framework, as well as the different benchmark services and results, are available as Open Source/Open Data on GitHub.

*Jiali Cheng,Rui Pan,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) face Tool-Memory Conflict (TMC), a knowledge contradiction between internal parametric knowledge and external tool knowledge, particularly in STEM tasks. Current resolution techniques are ineffective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the newly identified Tool-Memory Conflict (TMC) in tool-augmented large language models, which arises from contradictions between an LLM's internal and external tool-derived knowledge.

Method: The authors studied existing LLMs under TMC conditions, evaluated their priority handling of internal versus external knowledge, and assessed various techniques like prompting-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for resolving such conflicts.

Result: Findings show that current state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with TMC issues, especially in STEM tasks, and that neither prompting-based nor RAG-based methods effectively resolve these conflicts.

Conclusion: TMC is a critical challenge for tool-augmented LLMs, and current conflict resolution techniques are inadequate, highlighting the need for better solutions in this domain.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) have powered many applications. However, they are likely to suffer from knowledge conflict. In this paper, we propose a new type of knowledge conflict -- Tool-Memory Conflict (TMC), where the internal parametric knowledge contradicts with the external tool knowledge for tool-augmented LLMs. We find that existing LLMs, though powerful, suffer from TMC, especially on STEM-related tasks. We also uncover that under different conditions, tool knowledge and parametric knowledge may be prioritized differently. We then evaluate existing conflict resolving techniques, including prompting-based and RAG-based methods. Results show that none of these approaches can effectively resolve tool-memory conflicts.

### [305] [Explicating Tacit Regulatory Knowledge from LLMs to Auto-Formalize Requirements for Compliance Test Case Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09762)
*Zhiyi Xue,Xiaohong Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RAFT automates regulatory compliance test generation, reducing time and improving precision using multiple LLMs with adaptive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The process of translating regulations into executable test cases is largely manual, costly, and prone to errors. Large language models (LLMs) hold potential for automation but are unreliable due to hallucinations.

Method: RAFT utilizes an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy with multiple LLMs to distill regulatory knowledge into a meta-model, formal requirements, and testability constraints, which are integrated into prompts for precise formalization and automated test generation.

Result: RAFT demonstrated expert-level performance in regulatory compliance tasks across domains like finance, automotive, and power, outperforming existing methods and reducing generation and review time.

Conclusion: The proposed RAFT framework addresses the challenges in auto-formalization and compliance testing by leveraging adaptive strategies and multiple LLMs to achieve accuracy and efficiency in regulated domains.

Abstract: Compliance testing in highly regulated domains is crucial but largely manual, requiring domain experts to translate complex regulations into executable test cases. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automation, their susceptibility to hallucinations limits reliable application. Existing hybrid approaches mitigate this issue by constraining LLMs with formal models, but still rely on costly manual modeling. To solve this problem, this paper proposes RAFT, a framework for requirements auto-formalization and compliance test generation via explicating tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs. RAFT employs an Adaptive Purification-Aggregation strategy to explicate tacit regulatory knowledge from multiple LLMs and integrate it into three artifacts: a domain meta-model, a formal requirements representation, and testability constraints. These artifacts are then dynamically injected into prompts to guide high-precision requirement formalization and automated test generation. Experiments across financial, automotive, and power domains show that RAFT achieves expert-level performance, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while reducing overall generation and review time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how code style conventions and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time in open-source Java projects.

Method: Analyzed 1,036 Java repositories on GitHub and tracked a subset monthly to evaluate code style adherence and violations.

Result: Found common code violations including Javadoc and Naming issues, and noted missed violations by current static analysis tools. Repositories following declared practices achieved slightly better adherence.

Conclusion: Insights into adherence to code styles were provided, emphasizing areas for improvement and suggesting future practices to enhance Java code quality.

Abstract: Following code style conventions in software projects is essential for maintaining overall code quality. Adhering to these conventions improves maintainability, understandability, and extensibility. Additionally, following best practices during software development enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors. This paper analyzes 1,036 popular open-source JAVA projects on GITHUB to study how code style and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time, examining their prevalence and the most common violations. Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons learned and suggests future directions for improving code quality in JAVA projects.

### [308] [On Fun for Teaching Large Programming Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09842)
*Walid Maalej*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a catalogue of 10 physical fun activities to teach programming and software development concepts, tested with over 500+ students, showing improved engagement and concept retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of student disengagement and limited interaction in large, frontal lecture settings for teaching software development basics.

Method: The authors developed 10 physical fun activities linked to programming concepts and implemented them in a course with 500+ students. They conducted a three-year study and interviewed 15 former students and 14 global educators to evaluate the activities.

Result: The activities improved focus, concept retention, and reflection among students while emphasizing the need for concise design and clear linkage to concepts.

Conclusion: Physical fun activities, when designed effectively, can enhance engagement and learning outcomes in large programming classes by making abstract concepts interactive and memorable.

Abstract: Teaching software development basics to hundreds of students in a frontal setting is cost-efficient and thus still common in universities. However, in a large lecture hall, students can easily get bored, distracted, and disengaged. The frontal setting can also frustrate lecturers since interaction opportunities are limited and hard to scale. Fun activities can activate students and, if well designed, can also help remember and reflect on abstract software development concepts. We present a novel catalogue of ten physical fun activities, developed over years to reflect on basic programming and software development concepts. The catalogue includes the execution of a LA-OLA algorithm as in stadiums, using paper planes to simulate object messages and pointers, and traversing a lecture hall as a tree or a recursive structure. We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row. We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe. The results suggest that the fun activities can enable students to stay focused, remember key concepts, and reflect afterwards. However, keeping the activities concise and clearly linked to the concepts taught seems to be key to their acceptance and effectiveness.

*Saymon Souza,Amanda Santana,Eduardo Figueiredo,Igor Muzetti,João Eduardo Montandon,Lionel Briand*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the use of LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, Qwen2.5-Code) in detecting 9 types of code smells, comparing them with a combined LLM-static analysis tool strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code smells negatively impact software maintainability, reliability, and development cost. The study explores whether LLMs, known for their adaptability, can be effective in detecting code smells compared to traditional static analysis tools.

Method: The evaluation involved testing 4 LLMs across 9 code smells using a dataset derived from manual inspection by 76 developers on 268 code smell candidates across 30 Java projects.

Result: LLMs show better performance for simple code smells like Large Class and Long Method. A combined LLM-static analysis detection strategy improves results for 5 out of 9 code smells but also produces more false positives for complex smells.

Conclusion: The best detection strategy depends on the priority: Recall or Precision. While LLMs show promise, combining them with traditional tools can be beneficial for detecting certain code smells.

Abstract: Code smells are symptoms of potential code quality problems that may affect software maintainability, thus increasing development costs and impacting software reliability. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.

### [310] [Self-reflection in Automated Qualitative Coding: Improving Text Annotation through Secondary LLM Critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09905)
*Zackary Okun Dunivin,Mobina Noori,Seth Frey,Curtis Atkinson*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage workflow using LLMs to improve the precision of qualitative coding in large datasets through an initial annotation by a codebook-adapted LLM, followed by self-reflective re-evaluation by another LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qualitative coding with LLM classifiers often results in high error rates, particularly in zero- and few-shot scenarios, due to misinterpretations or lack of precision.

Method: The methodology involves a two-stage process where an LLM first annotates data using a codebook, and a second LLM critiques the first model's annotations through self-reflection, reading both the text and the rationale provided by the first model.

Result: Testing with over 3,000 emails found that first-line LLMs had false-positive rates between 8% and 54%, but the second-stage self-reflection process improved F1 scores significantly, resolving initial errors in the weakest codes.

Conclusion: This precision-first, two-stage workflow reduces errors and enhances the performance of LLM-assisted qualitative coding processes, making noisy classifiers more usable and reliable when combined with human guidance and validation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) allow for sophisticated qualitative coding of large datasets, but zero- and few-shot classifiers can produce an intolerable number of errors, even with careful, validated prompting. We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of current hybrid testing tools by proposing a new architecture that combines fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling, showing improved testing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the inefficiencies and limitations of state-of-the-art hybrid testing tools, which underutilize symbolic execution and sampling.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid testing architecture combining conventional symbolic execution with tailored engines, and establish principles to effectively integrate fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. They implement this in a tool called S$^2$F.

Result: S$^2$F achieves a 6.14% improvement in edge coverage and a 32.6% increase in discovered crashes compared to the SOTA tools. It also discovers three previously unknown crashes.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates that better integration of symbolic execution and sampling leads to significant improvements in testing efficacy, proving the merits of the new architecture.

Abstract: Hybrid testing that integrates fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling has demonstrated superior testing efficiency compared to individual techniques. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) hybrid testing tools do not fully exploit the capabilities of symbolic execution and sampling in two key aspects. First, the SOTA hybrid testing tools employ tailored symbolic execution engines that tend to over-prune branches, leading to considerable time wasted waiting for seeds from the fuzzer and missing opportunities to discover crashes. Second, existing methods do not apply sampling to the appropriate branches and therefore cannot utilize the full capability of sampling. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel hybrid testing architecture that combines the precision of conventional symbolic execution with the scalability of tailored symbolic execution engines. Based on this architecture, we propose several principles for combining fuzzing, symbolic execution, and sampling. We implement our method in a hybrid testing tool S$^2$F. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world programs. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^2$F outperforms the SOTA tool, achieving an average improvement of 6.14% in edge coverage and 32.6% in discovered crashes. Notably, our tool uncovers three previously unknown crashes in real-world programs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mark My Works, a local autograding system combining unit testing with AI-generated feedback to enhance feedback quality in programming courses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large programming courses face challenges in providing detailed, timely feedback on student submissions.

Method: The authors developed an autograding tool powered by role-based prompts and AI to evaluate submissions, provide code quality critiques, and generate feedback. They tested it in a 191-student engineering course, comparing its performance to human grading.

Result: AI-grading did not correlate linearly with human grading (r = -0.177), though both showed similar quality hierarchies. The AI system scored more conservatively but gave more detailed feedback than humans.

Conclusion: The system provides valuable, transparent feedback, though its scoring differs from human grading. It highlights AI's potential in augmenting educational assessment systems.

Abstract: Large programming courses struggle to provide timely, detailed feedback on student code. We developed Mark My Works, a local autograding system that combines traditional unit testing with LLM-generated explanations. The system uses role-based prompts to analyze submissions, critique code quality, and generate pedagogical feedback while maintaining transparency in its reasoning process.
  We piloted the system in a 191-student engineering course, comparing AI-generated assessments with human grading on 79 submissions. While AI scores showed no linear correlation with human scores (r = -0.177, p = 0.124), both systems exhibited similar left-skewed distributions, suggesting they recognize comparable quality hierarchies despite different scoring philosophies. The AI system demonstrated more conservative scoring (mean: 59.95 vs 80.53 human) but generated significantly more detailed technical feedback.

*Tsvi Cherny-Shahar,Amiram Yehudai*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG) and SPADE extractor to address difficulties faced by coding agents in understanding complex repository structures, and demonstrates significant improvement in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coding agents often struggle to navigate multilingual repositories with varied build systems and dependencies, leading to inefficiencies in understanding repository structures.

Method: The authors propose the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG) as a concrete dependency map and SPADE as a deterministic extractor for building this graph from repository artifacts. They test its utility by measuring its impact on agent performance across different repositories.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that using RIG significantly improves agent accuracy (12.2%) and efficiency (53.9%). Improvements are more pronounced in multilingual repositories compared to single language ones.

Conclusion: Providing RIG as context enhances agent performance by reducing structural misunderstandings, though quality of reasoning over graph structures remains an area for improvement.

Abstract: Repository aware coding agents often struggle to recover build and test structure, especially in multilingual projects where cross language dependencies are encoded across heterogeneous build systems and tooling. We introduce the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG), a deterministic, evidence backed architectural map that represents buildable components, aggregators, runners, tests, external packages, and package managers, connected by explicit dependency and coverage edges that trace back to concrete build and test definitions. We also present SPADE, a deterministic extractor that constructs RIG from build and test artifacts (currently with an automatic CMake plugin based on the CMake File API and CTest metadata), and exposes RIG as an LLM friendly JSON view that agents can treat as the authoritative description of repository structure.
  We evaluate three commercial agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) on eight repositories spanning low to high build oriented complexity, including the real world MetaFFI project. Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\%, yielding a mean 57.8\% reduction in seconds per correct answer. Gains are larger in multilingual repositories, which improve by 17.7\% in accuracy and 69.5\% in efficiency on average, compared to 6.6\% and 46.1\% in single language repositories. Qualitative analysis suggests that RIG shifts failures from structural misunderstandings toward reasoning mistakes over a correct structure, while rare regressions highlight that graph based reasoning quality remains a key factor.

TL;DR: Traditional malware detection methods rely on static models and large labeled datasets, which are ineffective in adapting to evolving threats. This paper proposes an online learning model using temporal behavioral features to detect malware dynamically and efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inability of existing malware detection approaches to adapt to the growing sophistication of malware and their reliance on static models and large labeled datasets.

Method: An online learning approach that continuously updates its models using behavioral features like process resource utilization metrics.

Result: The approach effectively detects zero-day malware and demonstrates superior performance in data-limited scenarios compared to traditional batch learning methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic, online learning-based malware detection methods adapt efficiently to evolving threats, making them more reliable than traditional batch methods in real-world settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly increased the interconnection of computational resources, creating an environment where malicious software (malware) can spread rapidly. To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively. Upon evaluating our approach against traditional batch algorithms, we find it effective in detecting zero-day malware. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in scenarios with limited data availability, where traditional batch-based approaches often struggle to perform reliably.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study examines the long-term influence of AI-powered coding assistants on professional coding practices using longitudinal data and a survey.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing incorporation of AI-powered tools in professional IDEs necessitates understanding their sustained impact on daily development, especially as prior research mostly explored short-term or perceptual effects.

Method: The study employs a mixed-method approach, analyzing two-year telemetry data from 800 developers alongside survey responses from 62 professionals. Five dimensions of workflow change—productivity, code quality, editing, reuse, and context switching—are examined.

Result: AI users generate more code but also delete more. Survey participants report enhanced productivity with negligible effects on other workflow dimensions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight changes in coding practices due to AI assistance and provide insights for improving AI-augmented software development tools.

Abstract: AI-powered coding assistants are rapidly becoming fixtures in professional IDEs, yet their sustained influence on everyday development remains poorly understood. Prior research has focused on short-term use or self-reported perceptions, leaving open questions about how sustained AI use reshapes actual daily coding practices in the long term. We address this gap with a mixed-method study of AI adoption in IDEs, combining longitudinal two-year fine-grained telemetry from 800 developers with a survey of 62 professionals. We analyze five dimensions of workflow change: productivity, code quality, code editing, code reuse, and context switching. Telemetry reveals that AI users produce substantially more code but also delete significantly more. Meanwhile, survey respondents report productivity gains and perceive minimal changes in other dimensions. Our results offer empirical insights into the silent restructuring of software workflows and provide implications for designing future AI-augmented tooling.

### [317] [Model See, Model Do? Exposure-Aware Evaluation of Bug-vs-Fix Preference in Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10496)
*Ali Al-Kaswan,Claudio Spiess,Prem Devanbu,Arie van Deursen,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how training data exposure influences large language models (LLMs) behavior in preferring correct and buggy code, proposing an exposure-aware evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether prior exposure to buggy or fixed code affects LLM behavior and preferences during code generation and debugging.

Method: Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark and Data Portraits for training corpus analysis, the authors stratified buggy and fixed code examples by exposure and evaluated LLM performance with code completion and likelihood-based metrics.

Result: Fixes were more frequently present than bugs in the training data, but models often reproduced bugs, especially when exposed to buggy variants. Metrics show varying tendencies, with token-probability consistently favoring fixes, while Gini reverses preference for buggy exposure.

Conclusion: Exposure can impact LLM behavior in bug-fix evaluations, potentially perpetuating memorized errors during code generation, underscoring risks in practice.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.

### [318] [Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal Sampling Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09848)
*Hong Ye Tan,Stanley Osher,Wuchen Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces an accelerated particle-based method for sampling from Gibbs distributions using a second-order score-based ODE, leveraging the regularized Wasserstein proximal method for increased efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency and convergence of sampling from Gibbs distributions by addressing the limitations of existing methods like kinetic Langevin algorithms.

Method: Proposes the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP), combining a second-order score-based ODE with the regularized Wasserstein proximal method. It includes both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Result: ARWP demonstrates higher asymptotic contraction rates, faster discrete-time mixing, better structural convergence, and improved tail exploration compared to existing methods. It also shows promise in Bayesian neural network tasks.

Conclusion: The ARWP method enhances sampling efficiency, mixing rates, and generalization capabilities, offering advantages over traditional approaches like kinetic Langevin methods.

Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving a finite number of particles using a particular score estimator rather than Brownian motion. To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.

### [319] [CROCS: A Two-Stage Clustering Framework for Behaviour-Centric Consumer Segmentation with Smart Meter Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10494)
*Luke W. Yerbury,Ricardo J. G. B. Campello,G. C. Livingston,Mark Goldsworthy,Lachlan O'Neil*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces CROCS, a two-stage clustering framework designed to improve consumer segmentation using smart meter data, to optimize DSM and DR programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grid operators face challenges from renewable energy uncertainty and broad electrification, requiring better Demand-Side Management mechanisms. Current segmentation methods fail due to behavioural diversity, missing data, and anomalies.

Method: CROCS uses two stages: first clustering daily consumer load profiles to create a Representative Load Set (RLS), then clustering consumers using the Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD) to draw meaningful behaviour prototypes.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and Australian datasets show CROCS effectively captures behavioural diversity, scales efficiently, and remains robust to data anomalies and missing values.

Conclusion: CROCS enhances consumer segmentation by leveraging behavioral diversity, leading to more efficient and interpretable DSM and DR program designs.

Abstract: With grid operators confronting rising uncertainty from renewable integration and a broader push toward electrification, Demand-Side Management (DSM) -- particularly Demand Response (DR) -- has attracted significant attention as a cost-effective mechanism for balancing modern electricity systems. Unprecedented volumes of consumption data from a continuing global deployment of smart meters enable consumer segmentation based on real usage behaviours, promising to inform the design of more effective DSM and DR programs. However, existing clustering-based segmentation methods insufficiently reflect the behavioural diversity of consumers, often relying on rigid temporal alignment, and faltering in the presence of anomalies, missing data, or large-scale deployments.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage clustering framework -- Clustered Representations Optimising Consumer Segmentation (CROCS). In the first stage, each consumer's daily load profiles are clustered independently to form a Representative Load Set (RLS), providing a compact summary of their typical diurnal consumption behaviours. In the second stage, consumers are clustered using the Weighted Sum of Minimum Distances (WSMD), a novel set-to-set measure that compares RLSs by accounting for both the prevalence and similarity of those behaviours. Finally, community detection on the WSMD-induced graph reveals higher-order prototypes that embody the shared diurnal behaviours defining consumer groups, enhancing the interpretability of the resulting clusters.
  Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real Australian smart meter datasets demonstrate that CROCS captures intra-consumer variability, uncovers both synchronous and asynchronous behavioural similarities, and remains robust to anomalies and missing data, while scaling efficiently through natural parallelisation.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper contributes to causal abstraction research by introducing identifiability results, an efficient algorithm, and lattice structure insights for learning abstract causal graphs from interventional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in estimating causal models at the feature-level granularity within datasets, and facilitate causal abstraction for practical applications.

Method: The authors propose a consistent algorithm for learning abstract causal graphs from interventional data with unknown intervention targets, coupled with graphical identifiability results and lattice structure exploration.

Result: The algorithm is tested on synthetic and real datasets, including a controlled physical system, showcasing its ability to retrieve causal insights effectively.

Conclusion: The study advances causal abstraction by providing practical tools and methods, along with theoretical implications, for understanding and modeling causal structures.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models are a powerful tool for representing causal relationships among jointly distributed random variables, especially concerning data from across different experimental settings. However, it is not always practical or desirable to estimate a causal model at the granularity of given features in a particular dataset. There is a growing body of research on causal abstraction to address such problems. We contribute to this line of research by (i) providing novel graphical identifiability results for practically-relevant interventional settings, (ii) proposing an efficient, provably consistent algorithm for directly learning abstract causal graphs from interventional data with unknown intervention targets, and (iii) uncovering theoretical insights about the lattice structure of the underlying search space, with connections to the field of causal discovery more generally. As proof of concept, we apply our algorithm on synthetic and real datasets with known ground truths, including measurements from a controlled physical system with interacting light intensity and polarization.

### [321] [Parametric RDT approach to computational gap of symmetric binary perceptron](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10628)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The study investigates statistical-computational gaps (SCG) within symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) using fully lifted random duality theory (fl-RDT). They observe structural changes that hint at a computational gap, supported by theoretical and empirical findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore and validate the existence of statistical-computational gaps in symmetric binary perceptrons, likely indicative of inherent limitations in algorithmic performance for certain computational problems.

Method: The researchers use fully lifted random duality theory (fl-RDT) and parametric changes in $c$-sequences to evaluate the satisfiability and algorithmic constraints. They also compare their outcomes to existing literature and design a specific algorithm to test theoretical predictions.

Result: They identify a computational gap, showing the difference between theoretical satisfiability thresholds ($α_c \approx 1.8159$) and algorithmic performance thresholds ($α_a \approx 1.6021$). Their findings align with recent studies on clustering phenomenon and overlap gap properties.

Conclusion: The presence of a statistical-computational gap in SBP is strongly supported by theoretical and numerical evidence. Their findings not only align with prior studies but also underline inherent algorithmic barriers within these systems.

Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($α_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($α_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=α_c-α_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $α_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $α_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($κ=1$ margin) we obtain $α_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $α_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $α_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $α\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $κ\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{α_a}{-\log\left ( α_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.

### [322] [Classification Imbalance as Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10630)
*Eric Xia,Jason M. Klusowski*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper studies classification imbalance, positioning it as a label shift problem under imbalanced source data and balanced target evaluation. It examines oversampling techniques like SMOTE, revealing significant cost discrepancies compared to simpler methods like bootstrapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of classification imbalance, a prevalent issue where one class of data is rarer than the other, and evaluate how oversampling methods perform under this scenario.

Method: The authors frame classification imbalance as a transfer learning problem under label prior shift. They analyze oversampling methods that balance classes by generating synthetic samples, with a specific focus on the SMOTE algorithm, and introduce a decomposition of excess risk to evaluate their performance.

Result: The analysis shows that SMOTE has a higher cost of transfer in moderately high dimensions compared to simpler bootstrapping methods, suggesting bootstrapping may outperform SMOTE in many cases. Experimental data supports these conclusions.

Conclusion: The findings indicate that simpler methods like bootstrapping may be preferable over SMOTE in many scenarios involving moderately high-dimensional data. The paper offers insights into choosing appropriate augmentation strategies for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Classification imbalance arises when one class is much rarer than the other. We frame this setting as transfer learning under label (prior) shift between an imbalanced source distribution induced by the observed data and a balanced target distribution under which performance is evaluated. Within this framework, we study a family of oversampling procedures that augment the training data by generating synthetic samples from an estimated minority-class distribution to roughly balance the classes, among which the celebrated SMOTE algorithm is a canonical example. We show that the excess risk decomposes into the rate achievable under balanced training (as if the data had been drawn from the balanced target distribution) and an additional term, the cost of transfer, which quantifies the discrepancy between the estimated and true minority-class distributions. In particular, we show that the cost of transfer for SMOTE dominates that of bootstrapping (random oversampling) in moderately high dimensions, suggesting that we should expect bootstrapping to have better performance than SMOTE in general. We corroborate these findings with experimental evidence. More broadly, our results provide guidance for choosing among augmentation strategies for imbalanced classification.

*Simon Martin,Giulio Biroli,Francis Bach*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper studies high-dimensional training dynamics of shallow neural networks with quadratic activation, analyzing overparameterization's effects on generalization and recovery in the extensive-width regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of overparameterization and feature learning in neural networks, especially considering label noise and generalization improvements.

Method: Derives gradient flow dynamics using dynamical mean-field theory, analyzes l2-regularized equations at long times, and evaluates spectral properties and generalization behavior.

Result: Revealed a double descent phenomenon in generalization under label noise, and provided an exact threshold for perfect recovery under minimal regularization.

Conclusion: Overparameterization can improve generalization and enable precise recovery, offering deeper insights into learning dynamics in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: We study the high-dimensional training dynamics of a shallow neural network with quadratic activation in a teacher-student setup. We focus on the extensive-width regime, where the teacher and student network widths scale proportionally with the input dimension, and the sample size grows quadratically. This scaling aims to describe overparameterized neural networks in which feature learning still plays a central role. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a dynamical characterization of the gradient flow, in the spirit of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under l2-regularization, we analyze these equations at long times and characterize the performance and spectral properties of the resulting estimator. This result provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of overparameterization on learning and generalization, and reveals a double descent phenomenon in the presence of label noise, where generalization improves beyond interpolation. In the small regularization limit, we obtain an exact expression for the perfect recovery threshold as a function of the network widths, providing a precise characterization of how overparameterization influences recovery.

Motivation: Bengali is a morphologically rich but low-resource language, making automatic speech recognition challenging. The study aims to address this gap by improving ASR performance for Bengali.

Method: The researchers developed a Conformer-CTC architecture with multi-level embeddings including phoneme, syllable, and wordpiece representations. It integrates preprocessing steps like silence trimming, resampling, Log-Mel spectrogram extraction, and SpecAugment.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-granular linguistic information with advanced acoustic modeling leads to improved scalability and effectiveness, offering a viable solution for low-resource ASR tasks like Bengali.

Abstract: Bengali, spoken by over 300 million people, is a morphologically rich and lowresource language, posing challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR). This research presents an end-to-end framework for Bengali ASR, building on a Conformer-CTC backbone with a multi-level embedding fusion mechanism that incorporates phoneme, syllable, and wordpiece representations. By enriching acoustic features with these linguistic embeddings, the model captures fine-grained phonetic cues and higher-level contextual patterns. The architecture employs early and late Conformer stages, with preprocessing steps including silence trimming, resampling, Log-Mel spectrogram extraction, and SpecAugment augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the strong potential of the model, achieving a word error rate (WER) of 10.01% and a character error rate (CER) of 5.03%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multi-granular linguistic information with acoustic modeling, providing a scalable approach for low-resource ASR development.

TL;DR: This paper proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a framework combining fuzzy logic, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), and blockchain to enhance privacy, security, and traceability in edge computing environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of IoT and edge computing enhances real-time data use but raises concerns about data privacy, security, and unauthorized access.

Method: The framework uses fuzzy logic for adaptive decision-making, ZKPs for privacy during verification, and blockchain with smart contracts for transparency and automation of access control.

Result: The model improves data privacy, accuracy in access control, and user trust by reducing unauthorized access and creating a transparent audit trail.

Conclusion: Fuzzychain-edge effectively secures IoT systems, advancing decentralized technologies for critical areas like healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid integration of IoT with edge computing has revolutionized various domains, particularly healthcare, by enabling real-time data sharing, remote monitoring, and decision-making. However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes. The proposed framework addresses key challenges by enhancing security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, and providing a transparent audit trail of data transactions. Expected outcomes include improved data privacy, accuracy in access control, and increased user trust in IoT systems. This research contributes significantly to advancing privacy-preserving, secure, and traceable solutions in IoT environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations in decentralized technologies and their applications in critical domains such as healthcare and beyond.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the security risks of AI agent skills, identifying vulnerabilities across 26.1% of tested skills, and proposes security measures for mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of security analysis in the expanding ecosystem of AI agent skills, which are prone to vulnerabilities and malicious use.

Method: The study analyzed 31,132 skills using a framework called SkillScan, integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification to detect vulnerabilities.

Result: It revealed 26.1% of skills demonstrated vulnerabilities and categorized them into four patterns—prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. High-severity risks were found in 5.2% of the skills.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the immediate need for robust security mechanisms including capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting to safeguard the ecosystem.

Abstract: The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p<0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.

### [327] [Synthetic Data for Veterinary EHR De-identification: Benefits, Limits, and Safety Trade-offs Under Fixed Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09756)
*David Brundage*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study evaluates the use of synthetic narratives generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve veterinary electronic health record (vEHR) de-identification, finding that synthetic data helps augment training but cannot replace real data for safety-critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is motivated by the challenge of protecting privacy-sensitive identifiers in vEHRs, a low-resource domain, while exploring if synthetic LLM-generated narratives can enhance de-identification efforts.

Method: The study used synthetic data generation via a privacy-preserving template method to create synthetic notes, then trained transformer models (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) under different data compositions to evaluate leakage rates and performance.

Result: Synthetic data augmentation improved performance with scaled training exposure, reducing leakage and slightly boosting model accuracy, but synthetic substitution degraded the ability to maintain safety-critical de-identification quality.

Conclusion: Synthetic narratives are beneficial for supplementary training in veterinary document de-identification but cannot replace real-world data when maintaining privacy guarantees is crucial.

Abstract: Veterinary electronic health records (vEHRs) contain privacy-sensitive identifiers that limit secondary use. While PetEVAL provides a benchmark for veterinary de-identification, the domain remains low-resource. This study evaluates whether large language model (LLM)-generated synthetic narratives improve de-identification safety under distinct training regimes, emphasizing (i) synthetic augmentation and (ii) fixed-budget substitution. We conducted a controlled simulation using a PetEVAL-derived corpus (3,750 holdout/1,249 train). We generated 10,382 synthetic notes using a privacy-preserving "template-only" regime where identifiers were removed prior to LLM prompting. Three transformer backbones (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) were trained under varying mixtures. Evaluation prioritized document-level leakage rate (the fraction of documents with at least one missed identifier) as the primary safety outcome. Results show that under fixed-sample substitution, replacing real notes with synthetic ones monotonically increased leakage, indicating synthetic data cannot safely replace real supervision. Under compute-matched training, moderate synthetic mixing matched real-only performance, but high synthetic dominance degraded utility. Conversely, epoch-scaled augmentation improved performance: PetBERT span-overlap F1 increased from 0.831 to 0.850 +/- 0.014, and leakage decreased from 6.32% to 4.02% +/- 0.19%. However, these gains largely reflect increased training exposure rather than intrinsic synthetic data quality. Corpus diagnostics revealed systematic synthetic-real mismatches in note length and label distribution that align with persistent leakage. We conclude that synthetic augmentation is effective for expanding exposure but is complementary, not substitutive, for safety-critical veterinary de-identification.

### [328] [A Novel Contrastive Loss for Zero-Day Network Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09902)
*Jack Wilkie,Hanan Hindy,Craig Michie,Christos Tachtatzis,James Irvine,Robert Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel contrastive loss function to improve machine learning performance for zero-day attack detection in network intrusion, achieving significant results on the Lycos2017 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models for network intrusion detection struggle to detect zero-day attacks, as they rely on previously trained attack classes or lead to high false positive rates when using anomaly detectors.

Method: The proposed method employs a novel contrastive loss function that learns the distribution of benign traffic while leveraging known attack classes, thus balancing robustness to imbalanced data and generalisation to unseen attacks.

Result: Experimental results on the Lycos2017 dataset show AUROC improvements of 0.000065 for known and 0.060883 for zero-day attack detection, along with an OpenAUC improvement of 0.170883 for open-set recognition.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances detection performance for both known and zero-day attacks while addressing limitations of conventional techniques, presenting a promising advancement for secure network intrusion detection.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in network intrusion detection; however, its performance significantly degrades when confronted by a new attack class -- a zero-day attack. In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android malware poses significant risks to privacy, security, and infrastructure. Due to its evolving complexity, traditional detection approaches require extensive feature sets, making them time-consuming and computationally expensive.

Method: The proposed method integrates FGSM for one-step perturbations and Diluted Convolutional Neural Networks to capture malware patterns over longer ranges with fewer features.

Result: The FGSM DICNN model achieved 99.44% accuracy, outperforming other methods such as Custom Deep Neural Networks.

Conclusion: This approach offers high malware detection accuracy with reduced computational complexity and reliance on large feature sets.

Abstract: Android malware has become an increasingly critical threat to organizations, society and individuals, posing significant risks to privacy, data security and infrastructure. As malware continues to evolve in terms of complexity and sophistication, the mitigation and detection of these malicious software instances have become more time consuming and challenging particularly due to the requirement of large number of features to identify potential malware. To address these challenges, this research proposes Fast Gradient Sign Method with Diluted Convolutional Neural Network (FGSM DICNN) method for malware classification. DICNN contains diluted convolutions which increases receptive field, enabling the model to capture dispersed malware patterns across long ranges using fewer features without adding parameters. Additionally, the FGSM strategy enhance the accuracy by using one-step perturbations during training that provides more defensive advantage of lower computational cost. This integration helps to manage high classification accuracy while reducing the dependence on extensive feature sets. The proposed FGSM DICNN model attains 99.44% accuracy while outperforming other existing approaches such as Custom Deep Neural Network (DCNN).

*Mohoshin Ara Tahera,Karamveer Singh Sidhu,Shuvalaxmi Dass,Sajal Saha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates privacy and security challenges posed by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, focusing on threats during the data preprocessing, fine-tuning, and inference phases, as well as proposing solutions for improved privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With LLMs gaining traction in healthcare, there is an urgent need to address privacy concerns due to sensitive medical data and diverse regulatory environments.

Method: The paper conducts a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) by analyzing threats across LLM phases—Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference—and reviews privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs).

Result: The study presents a detailed threat model, evaluates existing PPTs, and identifies their limitations in securing sensitive clinical data within diverse deployment settings.

Conclusion: The paper offers phase-aware recommendations and charts research directions to enhance privacy guarantees for LLMs in healthcare, creating a pathway toward trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in healthcare to support clinical decision-making, summarize electronic health records (EHRs), and enhance patient care. However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities. While existing defenses show promise, our analysis identifies persistent limitations in securing sensitive clinical data across diverse operational tiers. We conclude with phase-aware recommendations and future research directions aimed at strengthening privacy guarantees for LLMs in regulated environments. This work provides a foundation for understanding the intersection of LLMs, threats, and privacy in healthcare, offering a roadmap toward more robust and clinically trustworthy AI systems.

*Hao Li,Yankai Yang,G. Edward Suh,Ning Zhang,Chaowei Xiao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ReasAlign is a model-level solution designed to protect Large Language Models (LLMs) from indirect prompt injection attacks through reasoning, detection, and preserving user task continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vulnerability of LLM-powered systems to indirect prompt injection attacks necessitates strategies to ensure their safe and trustworthy performance.

Method: Structured reasoning steps analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve task continuity. A test-time scaling mechanism selects optimal reasoning trajectories using a preference-optimized judge model.

Result: ReasAlign outperforms prior defensive models, maintaining high utility (94.6%) and achieving low attack success rate (ASR) (3.6%) compared to Meta SecAlign.

Conclusion: ReasAlign provides strong defense against prompt injection attacks while preserving performance, representing practical enhancement in agentic system safety alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of powerful agentic systems capable of automating complex workflows across various fields. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external data can hijack agent behavior. In this work, we present ReasAlign, a model-level solution to improve safety alignment against indirect prompt injection attacks. The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR). These results demonstrate that ReasAlign achieves the best trade-off between security and utility, establishing a robust and practical defense against prompt injection attacks in real-world agentic systems.

*Nadya Abaev,Denis Klimov,Gerard Levinov,David Mimran,Yuval Elovici,Asaf Shabtai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentGuardian, a security framework that governs AI agents by enforcing context-aware access-control policies, ensuring system integrity and preventing misuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are increasingly used, and there is a need to ensure their integrity, security, and proper handling of inputs to prevent unauthorized actions or misuse.

Method: AgentGuardian monitors execution traces to learn legitimate behaviors and input patterns during a staging phase. It then derives adaptive context and control-flow-based policies to regulate tool calls and agent actions.

Result: AgentGuardian was evaluated on two real-world AI applications, effectively detecting malicious inputs and mitigating hallucination-driven errors while maintaining agent functionality.

Conclusion: AgentGuardian enhances the security and reliability of AI agents by providing context-sensitive operational governance, ensuring safe and accurate performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly used in a variety of domains to automate tasks, interact with users, and make decisions based on data inputs. Ensuring that AI agents perform only authorized actions and handle inputs appropriately is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing misuse. In this study, we introduce the AgentGuardian, a novel security framework that governs and protects AI agent operations by enforcing context-aware access-control policies. During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality. Moreover, its control-flow-based governance mechanism mitigates hallucination-driven errors and other orchestration-level malfunctions.

### [333] [Be Your Own Red Teamer: Safety Alignment via Self-Play and Reflective Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10589)
*Hao Wang,Yanting Wang,Hao Li,Rui Li,Lei Sha*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Safety Self-Play (SSP), a method using large language models (LLMs) to autonomously attack and defend in an evolving loop, addressing jailbreak attacks and enhancing safety defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the rigidity and limitations of current LLM safety alignment methods, which rely on static adversarial datasets and fail to address novel or evolving attacks effectively.

Method: The SSP system uses reinforcement learning where a single LLM alternates roles as both attacker and defender. It dynamically evolves its strategies to uncover vulnerabilities and learn from prior mistakes using a Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism.

Result: Experiments establish that SSP achieves stronger, adaptive safety defenses than traditional methods relying on static datasets, setting a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.

Conclusion: The SSP system demonstrates that empowering LLMs to autonomously refine safety mechanisms through self-play leads to more robust and generalizable defenses against new adversarial threats.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial ``jailbreak'' attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails. Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.

### [334] [PADER: Paillier-based Secure Decentralized Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10212)
*Chaochao Chen,Jiaming Qian,Fei Zheng,Yachuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes PADER, a decentralized and secure social recommendation system using the Paillier cryptosystem for privacy protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommendation systems often raise privacy concerns due to centralized data collection; this paper aims to tackle such issues with a decentralized approach.

Method: PADER applies the Paillier cryptosystem to a decentralized Social Regularization model, along with designing secure computation protocols and optimal data packing schemes.

Result: The system efficiently performs training and inference with hundreds of ratings in seconds and ~500K ratings in less than 3 hours per epoch.

Conclusion: PADER is practical and efficient for real-world use, providing privacy-preserving decentralized recommendation capabilities.

Abstract: The prevalence of recommendation systems also brings privacy concerns to both the users and the sellers, as centralized platforms collect as much data as possible from them. To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications.

*Choro Ulan uulu,Mikhail Kulyabin,Katharina M Zeiner,Jan Joosten,Nuno Miguel Martins Pacheco,Filippos Petridis,Rebecca Johnson,Jan Bosch,Helena Holmström Olsson*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how interactive Sankey diagrams can improve the understanding of parameter dependencies compared to traditional tables, reducing cognitive load and interaction complexity significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and high cognitive demands of traditional tabular interfaces in comprehending parameter dependencies in configuration-intensive software systems.

Method: A heuristic evaluation was conducted using the PURE method with three expert evaluators to compare Sankey diagram prototypes against traditional tabular representations.

Result: Interactive Sankey diagrams reduced cognitive load by 51% and interaction complexity by 56% compared to tables, making parameter dependencies immediately visible.

Conclusion: Flow-based visualizations like Sankey diagrams are effective for improving users' comprehension of parameter dependencies in software systems, applicable across domains dealing with complex configurations.

Abstract: Understanding complex parameter dependencies is critical for effective configuration and maintenance of software systems across diverse domains - from Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) to cloud infrastructure and database management. However, legacy tabular interfaces create a major bottleneck: engineers cannot easily comprehend how parameters relate across the system, leading to inefficient workflows, costly configuration errors, and reduced system trust - a fundamental program comprehension challenge in configuration-intensive software. This research evaluates whether interactive Sankey diagrams can improve comprehension of parameter dependencies compared to traditional spreadsheet interfaces. We employed a heuristic evaluation using the PURE method with three expert evaluators (UX design, simulation, and software development specialists) to compare a Sankey-based prototype to traditional tabular representations for core engineering tasks. Our key contribution demonstrates that flow-based parameter visualizations significantly reduce cognitive load (51% lower PURE scores) and interaction complexity (56% fewer steps) compared to traditional tables, while making parameter dependencies immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction. By explicitly visualizing parameter relationships, Sankey diagrams address a core software visualization challenge: helping users comprehend complex system configurations without requiring deep tool-specific knowledge. While demonstrated through CAE software, this research contributes to program comprehension and software visualization by showing that dependency-aware visualizations can significantly improve understanding of configuration-intensive systems. The findings have implications for any software domain where comprehending complex parameter relationships is essential for effective system use and maintenance.

*Nadine Kuo,Agnia Sergeyuk,Valerie Chen,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper studies proactive AI assistance for developers, revealing timing of interventions as critical for developer receptivity and cognitive alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore when and how developers are receptive to proactive in-IDE AI assistance in their workflows, which remains underexplored.

Method: A five-day field study with 15 developers interacting with proactive AI code quality suggestions in a production-grade IDE, analyzing 229 interventions and 5,732 interaction points.

Result: The study shows developers are more receptive to AI suggestions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) than mid-task, with reduced interpretation time for well-timed proactive suggestions.

Conclusion: Timing interventions and aligning them with developer workflows can enhance the effectiveness of proactive AI assistants, balancing AI autonomy and user control.

Abstract: Current in-IDE AI coding tools typically rely on time-consuming manual prompting and context management, whereas proactive alternatives that anticipate developer needs without explicit invocation remain underexplored. Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment. This study provides actionable implications for designing proactive coding assistants, including how to time interventions, align them with developer context, and strike a balance between AI agency and user control in production IDEs.

*Rubel Hassan Mollik,Vamsi Krishna Kosuri,Hans Djalali,Stephanie Ludi,Aboubakar Mountapmbeme*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Researchers addressed the inaccessibility of block-based programming environments (BBPEs) for blind or visually impaired learners by introducing an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BBPEs like Scratch and Code.org are inaccessible to blind or visually impaired learners due to barriers in current accessibility solutions, which limit adoption.

Method: The study proposes an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) with a modular architecture for seamless integration into existing BBPEs. It incorporates a 3D hierarchical navigation model, stack labeling, block numbering, mode-based editing, and WAI-ARIA compatibility.

Result: Integration of the EAF framework into two BBPEs was evaluated with 177 test scenarios and interviews with four users, showing improved spatial orientation and mental model development compared to default accessibility options.

Conclusion: The EAF demonstrates that modular architecture can effectively improve accessibility while remaining compatible with existing block-based programming environments.

Abstract: Block-based programming environments (BBPEs) such as Scratch and Code.org are now widely used in K-12 computer science classes, but they remain mostly inaccessible to blind or visually impaired (BVI) learners. A major problem is that prior accessibility solutions have relied on modifications to the Blockly library, making them difficult to apply in existing BBPEs and thereby limiting adoption. We present an Extension-based Accessibility Framework (EAF) to make BBPEs accessible for BVI students. The framework uses a modular architecture that enables seamless integration with existing Blockly-based BBPEs. We present an innovative three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical navigation model featuring stack labeling and block numbering, mode-based editing to prevent accidental modifications, and WAI-ARIA implementation to ensure compatibility with external screen readers. We evaluated our approach by integrating the EAF framework into two BBPEs (covering 177 test cases) and conducting semi-structured interviews with four participants using VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA. Participants reported clearer spatial orientation and easier mental model formation compared to default Blockly keyboard navigation. EAF shows that modular architecture can provide comprehensive accessibility while ensuring compatibility with existing BBPEs.

*Jordan Taylor,William Agnew,Maarten Sap,Sarah E. Fox,Haiyi Zhu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper critiques the LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP) for biases in its aesthetic evaluation, disproportionately favoring certain demographics and artistic styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whose taste and values are represented in generative AI models, and whether current aesthetic evaluation measures are inclusive.

Method: Auditing the LAP model across three datasets, examining filtering patterns, performing image scoring, analyzing art biases, and conducting a digital ethnography to uncover development origins.

Result: LAP favors images of women, western and Japanese art styles, and realistic imagery while filtering out content related to men, LGBTQ+, and diverse artistic representations.

Conclusion: The aesthetic evaluation model reinforces harmful biases rooted in western imperial and male gazes. A shift towards pluralistic measures of aesthetics is recommended.

Abstract: Visual generative AI models are trained using a one-size-fits-all measure of aesthetic appeal. However, what is deemed "aesthetic" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of "aesthetics" toward more pluralistic evaluation.

TL;DR: LangLasso is a tool that generates natural language descriptions of data clusters using large language models, making cluster interpretation more accessible to non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of interpreting clusters in dimensionality-reduced data due to complex, non-linear combinations of features, especially for non-experts.

Method: Interactive natural language generation using large language models (LLMs) to describe clusters, integrated as a complement to visual analytics approaches.

Result: LangLasso reliably generates human-readable cluster explanations, making it easier for broader, non-expert audiences to interact with and understand datasets.

Conclusion: LangLasso advances cluster interpretation by simplifying its accessibility while integrating external contextual knowledge, bridging the gap for non-technical users.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a powerful technique for revealing structure and potential clusters in data. However, as the axes are complex, non-linear combinations of features, they often lack semantic interpretability. Existing visual analytics (VA) methods support cluster interpretation through feature comparison and interactive exploration, but they require technical expertise and intense human effort. We present \textit{LangLasso}, a novel method that complements VA approaches through interactive, natural language descriptions of clusters using large language models (LLMs). It produces human-readable descriptions that make cluster interpretation accessible to non-experts and allow integration of external contextual knowledge beyond the dataset. We systematically evaluate the reliability of these explanations and demonstrate that \langlasso provides an effective first step for engaging broader audiences in cluster interpretation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper investigates communication challenges older adults face in tech support and proposes using AI models to enhance solution accuracy and interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many older adults face difficulty in effectively articulating tech-related problems due to cognitive changes and unfamiliarity with technical language.

Method: A diary study was conducted along with reflexive thematic analysis and prompt chaining in GPT-4o to elicit and rephrase tech-related queries from older adults. Two experiments were carried out to validate solution accuracy and interaction comfort.

Result: AI-rephrased older adults’ queries improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%), Google search effectiveness (69% vs. 35%), and understanding by younger adults (93.7% vs. 65.8%). Older adults reported high ease and confidence in following AI solutions (94.7%).

Conclusion: Foundation models like GPT-4o can effectively address communication barriers in aging populations, providing scalable solutions and creating datasets like OATS for equitable AI development.

Abstract: While high-quality technology support can assist older adults in using digital applications, many struggle to articulate their issues due to unfamiliarity with technical terminology and age-related cognitive changes. This study examines these communication challenges and explores AI-based approaches to mitigate them. We conducted a diary study with English-speaking, community-dwelling older adults to collect asynchronous, technology-related queries and used reflexive thematic analysis to identify communication barriers. To address these barriers, we evaluated how foundation models can paraphrase older adults' queries to improve solution accuracy. Two controlled experiments followed: one with younger adults evaluating AI-rephrased queries and another with older adults evaluating AI-generated solutions. We also developed a pipeline using large language models to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). We identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. Our prompt-chaining approach using the large language model, GPT-4o, elicited contextual details, paraphrased the original query, and generated a solution. AI-rephrased queries significantly improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%) and Google search results (69% vs. 35%). Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries (93.7% vs. 65.8%) and reported greater confidence and ease. Older adults reported high perceived ability to answer contextual questions (89.8%) and follow solutions (94.7%), with high confidence and ease. OATS demonstrated strong fidelity and face validity. This work shows how foundation models can enhance technology support for older adults by addressing age-related communication barriers. The OATS dataset offers a scalable resource for developing equitable AI systems that better serve aging populations.

*Bohan Zhang,Chengke Bu,Paramveer S. Dhillon*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI writing assistants improve fluency and reduce cognitive effort but can decrease psychological ownership. Tested design integrations show partial mitigation of ownership loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI writing assistants affect users' sense of ownership while maintaining fluency and cognitive benefits.

Method: An online study with 176 participants completing professional writing tasks under different AI assistance conditions, including style personalization and persona-based coaching.

Result: AI reduced psychological ownership but decreased cognitive load. Style personalization partially restored ownership while encouraging more AI incorporation into text.

Conclusion: Ownership-aware design can mitigate the negative effects of AI writing aids on psychological ownership while enhancing their effectiveness.

Abstract: AI writing assistants can reduce effort and improve fluency, but they may also weaken writers' sense of authorship. We study this tension with an ownership-aware co-writing editor that offers on-demand, sentence-level suggestions and tests two common design choices: persona-based coaching and style personalization. In an online study (N=176), participants completed three professional writing tasks: an email without AI help, a proposal with generic AI suggestions, and a cover letter with persona-based coaching, while half received suggestions tailored to a brief sample of their prior writing. Across the two AI-assisted tasks, psychological ownership dropped relative to unassisted writing (about 0.85-1.0 points on a 7-point scale), even as cognitive load decreased (about 0.9 points) and quality ratings stayed broadly similar overall. Persona coaching did not prevent the ownership decline. Style personalization partially restored ownership (about +0.43) and increased AI incorporation in text (+5 percentage points). We distill five design patterns: on-demand initiation, micro-suggestions, voice anchoring, audience scaffolds, and point-of-decision provenance, to guide authorship-preserving writing tools.

### [344] [Detecting Batch Heterogeneity via Likelihood Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09758)
*Austin Talbot,Yue Ke*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: Batch effects in genomic diagnostics disturb reliable CNV detection from NGS data, and this paper introduces a Bayesian model evidence-based method to identify them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch effects cause mismatches in process-matched assumptions in CNV detection, leading to unreliable clinical interpretations.

Method: A novel method clusters samples based on Bayesian model evidence, leveraging likelihood ratio tests with parametric bootstrap calibration.

Result: The method effectively controls Type I error and demonstrates improved clustering accuracy on synthetic, clinical, and cross-modality data.

Conclusion: Bayesian evidence successfully distinguishes batch effects from biological variation, aiding robust and clinically valid analyses.

Abstract: Batch effects represent a major confounder in genomic diagnostics. In copy number variant (CNV) detection from NGS, many algorithms compare read depth between test samples and a reference sample, assuming they are process-matched. When this assumption is violated, with causes ranging from reagent lot changes to multi-site processing, the reference becomes inappropriate, introducing false CNV calls or masking true pathogenic variants. Detecting such heterogeneity before downstream analysis is critical for reliable clinical interpretation. Existing batch effect detection methods either cluster samples based on raw features, risking conflation of biological signal with technical variation, or require known batch labels that are frequently unavailable. We introduce a method that addresses both limitations by clustering samples according to their Bayesian model evidence. The central insight is that evidence quantifies compatibility between data and model assumptions, technical artifacts violate assumptions and reduce evidence, whereas biological variation, including CNV status, is anticipated by the model and yields high evidence. This asymmetry provides a discriminative signal that separates batch effects from biology. We formalize heterogeneity detection as a likelihood ratio test for mixture structure in evidence space, using parametric bootstrap calibration to ensure conservative false positive rates. We validate our approach on synthetic data demonstrating proper Type I error control, three clinical targeted sequencing panels (liquid biopsy, BRCA, and thalassemia) exhibiting distinct batch effect mechanisms, and mouse electrophysiology recordings demonstrating cross-modality generalization. Our method achieves superior clustering accuracy compared to standard correlation-based and dimensionality-reduction approaches while maintaining the conservativeness required for clinical usage.

*Harry Aytug*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: This paper introduces causalfe, a Python package implementing Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE) to estimate treatment effects in panel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard causal forest methods face challenges with panel data due to spurious heterogeneity caused by fixed effects.

Method: The CFFE technique utilizes node-level residualization during tree construction to eliminate fixed effects locally for accurate treatment effect estimation.

Result: Simulation studies confirm the reliability of the CFFE estimator under different data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology succeeds in addressing fixed effects issues in panel data, offering improved estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects.

Abstract: The causalfe package provides a Python implementation of Causal Forests with Fixed Effects (CFFE) for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in panel data settings. Standard causal forest methods struggle with panel data because unit and time fixed effects induce spurious heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates. The CFFE approach addresses this by performing node-level residualization during tree construction, removing fixed effects within each candidate split rather than globally. This paper describes the methodology, documents the software interface, and demonstrates the package through simulation studies that validate the estimator's performance under various data generating processes.

### [346] [Instruction Finetuning LLaMA-3-8B Model Using LoRA for Financial Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10043)
*Zhiming Lian*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: This paper enhances Meta's Llama 3 8B using instruction fine-tuning and LoRA for financial named-entity recognition (NER), achieving a 0.894 micro-F1 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing large language models (LLMs) in accurately recognizing financial named-entities, such as distinguishing organizations from individuals and correctly identifying monetary amounts, which is crucial for creating structured knowledge graphs.

Method: The authors use instruction fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to train Meta's Llama 3 8B model. They convert annotated sentences into instruction-input-output triples and fine-tune the model using small low-rank matrices.

Result: The proposed approach achieved a superior micro-F1 score of 0.894 on a 1,693-sentence corpus, outperforming well-known models like Qwen3-8B, Baichuan2-7B, T5, and BERT-Base. Additional analysis and visualizations of data and metrics were also conducted.

Conclusion: Instruction fine-tuning combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning like LoRA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for domain-specific tasks such as financial NER.

Abstract: Particularly, financial named-entity recognition (NER) is one of the many important approaches to translate unformatted reports and news into structured knowledge graphs. However, free, easy-to-use large language models (LLMs) often fail to differentiate organisations as people, or disregard an actual monetary amount entirely. This paper takes Meta's Llama 3 8B and applies it to financial NER by combining instruction fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Each annotated sentence is converted into an instruction-input-output triple, enabling the model to learn task descriptions while fine-tuning with small low-rank matrices instead of updating all weights. Using a corpus of 1,693 sentences, our method obtains a micro-F1 score of 0.894 compared with Qwen3-8B, Baichuan2-7B, T5, and BERT-Base. We present dataset statistics, describe training hyperparameters, and perform visualizations of entity density, learning curves, and evaluation metrics. Our results show that instruction tuning combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables state-of-the-art performance on domain-sensitive NER.

*Yongzhen Feng,Weiwei Wang,Raymond K. W. Wong,Xianyang Zhang*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified and efficient framework for fair regression tasks focusing on minimizing risk while upholding a demographic parity constraint, applicable across a variety of loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research addresses the limitations of existing methods for fair regression, which are either restricted to specific loss functions or involve complex non-convex optimization, aiming for a more versatile and computationally efficient solution.

Method: The authors propose a framework for fair risk minimization that applies to different regression tasks and derive a novel characterization of fair risk minimizers. They also establish theoretical guarantees for the proposed estimator.

Result: The approach is shown to be computationally efficient, theoretically consistent, and applicable to diverse loss functions, successfully maintaining fairness constraints while minimizing risks.

Conclusion: This framework provides a powerful and practical solution to fair regression challenges, balancing performance and fairness across a wide range of regression scenarios.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for fair regression tasks formulated as risk minimization problems subject to a demographic parity constraint. Unlike many existing approaches that are limited to specific loss functions or rely on challenging non-convex optimization, our framework is applicable to a broad spectrum of regression tasks. Examples include linear regression with squared loss, binary classification with cross-entropy loss, quantile regression with pinball loss, and robust regression with Huber loss. We derive a novel characterization of the fair risk minimizer, which yields a computationally efficient estimation procedure for general loss functions. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator and derive its convergence rates under mild assumptions. We illustrate the method's versatility through detailed discussions of several common loss functions. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach effectively minimizes risk while satisfying fairness constraints across various regression settings.

### [348] [Adjusted Similarity Measures and a Violation of Expectations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10641)
*William L. Lippitt,Edward J. Bedrick,Nichole E. Carlson*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper focuses on generalizing adjustment operators for similarity measures, ensuring proper null expectations and addressing flaws in current adjustment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretation of discrete labeling comparisons by addressing inconsistencies in adjusted measures under null distributions.

Method: The authors generalize adjustment operators to broader null models, incorporating statistical standardization, and define sufficient conditions for reliable adjustment.

Result: They identify flaws in traditional adjustment methods that may lead to incorrect results, like non-positive or biased measures, under improper null distributions.

Conclusion: A broader framework is proposed for adjusting similarity measures with conditions ensuring proper statistical behavior, improving reliability in practical applications.

Abstract: Adjusted similarity measures, such as Cohen's kappa for inter-rater reliability and the adjusted Rand index used to compare clustering algorithms, are a vital tool for comparing discrete labellings. These measures are intended to have the property of 0 expectation under a null distribution and maximum value 1 under maximal similarity to aid in interpretation. Measures are frequently adjusted with respect to the permutation distribution for historic and analytic reasons. There is currently renewed interest in considering other null models more appropriate for context, such as clustering ensembles permitting a random number of identified clusters. The purpose of this work is two -- fold: (1) to generalize the study of the adjustment operator to general null models and to a more general procedure which includes statistical standardization as a special case and (2) to identify sufficient conditions for the adjustment operator to produce the intended properties, where sufficient conditions are related to whether and how observed data are incorporated into null distributions. We demonstrate how violations of the sufficient conditions may lead to substantial breakdown, such as by producing a non-positive measure under traditional adjustment rather than one with mean 0, or by producing a measure which is deterministically 0 under statistical standardization.

### [349] [A Generalizable Framework for Building Executable Domain-Specific LLMs under Data Scarcity: Demonstration on Semiconductor TCAD Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10128)
*Di Wang,Zhenhua Wu,Yu Liu,Kai Chang,Shaohua Wu*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to build compact and executable domain-specific language models, using synthetic data generation, code-centric workflows, and targeted evaluation to deliver high performance in specific professional domains like semiconductor TCAD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity and strict requirements for syntactically valid and executable text generation in specialized domains, the paper aims to create a methodology for building effective domain-specific LLMs.

Method: The framework employs large-scale synthetic QA data, a code-centric workflow for transforming tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations while ensuring code executability, and a controlled evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation techniques.

Result: The proposed framework, demonstrated on TcadGPT for TCAD, achieves 85.6% semantic accuracy and 80.0% syntax pass rate, outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs like GPT-4o. The same approach improves script generation success rates in other domains.

Conclusion: The framework is effective, robust, and reproducible for building executable LLMs in low-resource, domain-specific professional fields, with datasets and code publicly available for replication and further research.

Abstract: Scientific and engineering verticals often suffer from data scarcity and strict executability requirements: models must generate not only fluent text, but also syntactically valid, tool-compilable scripts. We present a schema-first alignment framework for building compact, executable domain-specific LLMs in low-resource settings. The framework integrates three core components: (i) large-scale synthetic QA data generation from expert documentation to instill foundational domain knowledge; (ii) a code-centric IR->DPO workflow that converts verified tool decks into interpretable intermediate representations (IR), performs equivalence-preserving diversification, and constructs preference pairs to directly optimize instruction compliance and code executability; and (iii) a controlled evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), showing that while RAG benefits general LLMs, it can marginally degrade the performance of already domain-aligned models.
  We demonstrate the framework by instantiating TcadGPT for semiconductor Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). Using 1.5M synthetic QA pairs and an IR-driven DPO dataset, TcadGPT attains 85.6% semantic accuracy and an 80.0% syntax pass rate on SDE executability tests, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art general LLMs such as GPT-4o. To probe portability beyond TCAD, we apply the same recipe to the open-source FEM solver Elmer, observing consistent improvements in script-level success rates over general-purpose baselines. All datasets, benchmarks, and code (including P1, P2, and IR->DPO) are released for reproducibility. Together, these results suggest that the proposed framework provides a robust and reproducible path toward executable LLMs in specialized, data-scarce professional domains.

### [350] [Stable Differentiable Modal Synthesis for Learning Nonlinear Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10453)
*Victor Zheleznov,Stefan Bilbao,Alec Wright,Simon King*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper combines scalar auxiliary variable techniques with neural ODEs to create a stable and differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics, tested on a vibrating string system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of modeling nonlinear dynamics in physical systems while ensuring numerical stability and interpretability.

Method: The approach integrates scalar auxiliary variable techniques with neural ODEs, leveraging analytical solutions of linear vibration modes for training.

Result: The model successfully learns the dynamics of nonlinear transverse vibration of a string, with its validity shown through synthetic data and sound examples.

Conclusion: The proposed technique offers an effective and interpretable pathway towards modeling and learning nonlinear physical dynamics using hybrid numerical and machine learning methods.

Abstract: Modal methods are a long-standing approach to physical modelling synthesis. Extensions to nonlinear problems are possible, including the case of a high-amplitude vibration of a string. A modal decomposition leads to a densely coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in scalar auxiliary variable techniques has enabled construction of explicit and stable numerical solvers for such classes of nonlinear systems. On the other hand, machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) have been successful in modelling nonlinear systems automatically from data. In this work, we examine how scalar auxiliary variable techniques can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations to yield a stable differentiable model capable of learning nonlinear dynamics. The proposed approach leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes so that physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the model architecture. As a proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for the nonlinear transverse vibration of a string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in vision-language models caused by cross-modal alignment collapse, particularly when dealing with out-of-distribution concepts.

Method: Develops the MACL framework with four agents (image, text, name, coordination) for structured message exchange, few-shot learning, and adaptive dynamic balancing.

Result: MACL yields 1-5% precision gains on the VISTA-Beyond dataset in few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: MACL effectively enhances vision-language model performance, especially in handling out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Multi-Agent Cooperative Learning (MACL) framework to address cross-modal alignment collapse in vision-language models when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) concepts. Four core agents, including image, text, name, and coordination agents, collaboratively mitigate modality imbalance through structured message passing. The proposed framework enables multi-agent feature space name learning, incorporates a context exchange enhanced few-shot learning algorithm, and adopts an adaptive dynamic balancing mechanism to regulate inter-agent contributions.

TL;DR: TopoDIM is a novel framework enabling decentralized, efficient, and adaptive communication among heterogeneous agents, reducing latency and improving multi-agent system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high latency and computational inefficiency in spatio-temporal interaction paradigms for LLM-based multi-agent systems, by leveraging evaluation and debate mechanisms to enhance communication efficiency and problem-solving.

Method: TopoDIM introduces one-shot topology generation with diverse interaction modes, enabling decentralized and autonomous heterogeneous communication among agents without iterative dialogues.

Result: TopoDIM reduces token consumption by 46.41% while improving task performance by 1.50% compared to state-of-the-art methods, and effectively adapts to heterogeneous agent communication.

Conclusion: TopoDIM offers a significant improvement in efficiency and performance for decentralized multi-agent communication, achieving better token efficiency and clearer collaboration mechanisms.

Abstract: Optimizing communication topology in LLM-based multi-agent system is critical for enabling collective intelligence. Existing methods mainly rely on spatio-temporal interaction paradigms, where the sequential execution of multi-round dialogues incurs high latency and computation. Motivated by the recent insights that evaluation and debate mechanisms can improve problem-solving in multi-agent systems, we propose TopoDIM, a framework for one-shot Topology generation with Diverse Interaction Modes. Designed for decentralized execution to enhance adaptability and privacy, TopoDIM enables agents to autonomously construct heterogeneous communication without iterative coordination, achieving token efficiency and improved task performance. Experiments demonstrate that TopoDIM reduces total token consumption by 46.41% while improving average performance by 1.50% over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework exhibits strong adaptability in organizing communication among heterogeneous agents. Code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TopoDIM-8D35/

*Xi Shi,Mengxin Zheng,Qian Lou*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAMaS, a framework to reduce latency in multi-agent systems through parallel execution optimization, achieving significant latency reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high inference latency in multi-agent systems due to sequential execution and repeated model calls, especially in time-sensitive scenarios.

Method: Proposes a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework (LAMaS) that explicitly optimizes parallel execution by minimizing the critical execution path.

Result: LAMaS reduces critical path length by 38-46% while either maintaining or improving task performance across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution is crucial for designing efficient multi-agent systems, as demonstrated by LAMaS's effectiveness.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) enable complex reasoning by coordinating multiple agents, but often incur high inference latency due to multi-step execution and repeated model invocations, severely limiting their scalability and usability in time-sensitive scenarios. Most existing approaches primarily optimize task performance and inference cost, and explicitly or implicitly assume sequential execution, making them less optimal for controlling latency under parallel execution. In this work, we investigate learning-based orchestration of multi-agent systems with explicit latency supervision under parallel execution. We propose Latency-Aware Multi-agent System (LAMaS), a latency-aware multi-agent orchestration framework that enables parallel execution and explicitly optimizes the critical execution path, allowing the controller to construct execution topology graphs with lower latency under parallel execution. Our experiments show that our approach reduces critical path length by 38-46% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline for multi-agent architecture search across multiple benchmarks, while maintaining or even improving task performance. These results highlight the importance of explicitly optimizing latency under parallel execution when designing efficient multi-agent systems.

### [354] [Procedural Fairness in Multi-Agent Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10600)
*Joshua Caiata,Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces procedural fairness as a new objective, emphasizing equal decision-making power in multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), and demonstrates its trade-offs with outcome-based fairness objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in MA-MAB has mainly focused on outcomes, but evidence suggests fairness should also involve equitable decision-making processes.

Method: A procedural fairness framework is proposed, ensuring equal representation, proportional outcomes, and minimal sacrifices to outcome-based fairness objectives like equality.

Result: Empirical results show outcome-based fairness neglects equal representation, but procedurally fair policies achieve minimal trade-offs in outcomes.

Conclusion: Different fairness notions reflect incompatible values, and procedural fairness deserves greater consideration as a fairness objective with explicit normative choices.

Abstract: In the context of multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MA-MAB), fairness is often reduced to outcomes: maximizing welfare, reducing inequality, or balancing utilities. However, evidence in psychology, economics, and Rawlsian theory suggests that fairness is also about process and who gets a say in the decisions being made. We introduce a new fairness objective, procedural fairness, which provides equal decision-making power for all agents, lies in the core, and provides for proportionality in outcomes. Empirical results confirm that fairness notions based on optimizing for outcomes sacrifice equal voice and representation, while the sacrifice in outcome-based fairness objectives (like equality and utilitarianism) is minimal under procedurally fair policies. We further prove that different fairness notions prioritize fundamentally different and incompatible values, highlighting that fairness requires explicit normative choices. This paper argues that procedural legitimacy deserves greater focus as a fairness objective, and provides a framework for putting procedural fairness into practice.

### [355] [Redundancy-Driven Top-$k$ Functional Dependency Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10130)
*Xiaolong Wan,Xixian Han*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDP, a method to identify the top-k functional dependencies in relation to redundancy count, addressing computational inefficiencies and large result sets in FD discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finding functional dependencies (FDs) in relational databases is computationally expensive and generates large results, making traditional discovery methods impractical for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets.

Method: SDP selectively discovers FDs ranked by redundancy, using a monotone upper bound for pruning the search space and optimization techniques such as partition cardinality ordering, pairwise statistics, and a global scheduler.

Result: SDP demonstrates significant computational and memory efficiency compared to exhaustive methods across 40 datasets.

Conclusion: SDP improves FD discovery by focusing on relevance and redundancy, making it faster and more memory-efficient for large datasets.

Abstract: Functional dependencies (FDs) are basic constraints in relational databases and are used for many data management tasks. Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: This study examined reasoning large language models (LLMs) in autonomously optimizing atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. The agents, leveraging models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5, showed success despite variability in their output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the feasibility of using reasoning LLMs for ALD optimization to offer autonomous and unsupervised interaction without prior knowledge of self-limited processes.

Method: The study employs reasoning LLM-based agents interacting iteratively with an ALD reactor. The agents generate open reasoning responses followed by structured outputs in a two-step optimization process.

Result: The agents successfully optimized ALD processes, evaluated via reaction pathways, but showed variability due to the non-deterministic responses of the models.

Conclusion: Reasoning LLM-based agents demonstrate sound logic in process optimization. However, their outcomes can be influenced by prior decisions when exploring the optimization space.

Abstract: In this work we explore the performance and behavior of reasoning large language models to autonomously optimize atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. In the ALD process optimization task, an agent built on top of a reasoning LLM has to find optimal dose times for an ALD precursor and a coreactant without any prior knowledge on the process, including whether it is actually self-limited. The agent is meant to interact iteratively with an ALD reactor in a fully unsupervised way. We evaluate this agent using a simple model of an ALD tool that incorporates ALD processes with different self-limited surface reaction pathways as well as a non self-limited component. Our results show that agents based on reasoning models like OpenAI's o3 and GPT5 consistently succeeded at completing this optimization task. However, we observed significant run-to-run variability due to the non deterministic nature of the model's response. In order to understand the logic followed by the reasoning model, the agent uses a two step process in which the model first generates an open response detailing the reasoning process. This response is then transformed into a structured output. An analysis of these reasoning traces showed that the logic of the model was sound and that its reasoning was based on the notions of self-limited process and saturation expected in the case of ALD. However, the agent can sometimes be misled by its own prior choices when exploring the optimization space.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new Monte Carlo approach for efficient model counting of DNF formulas, outperforming prior methods significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges in model counting of DNF formulas, important for applications like probabilistic inference and database queries, where existing methods have efficiency and scalability limitations.

Method: The method involves a new Monte Carlo approach featuring an adaptive stopping rule and short-circuit formula evaluation, achieving probabilistically approximate correctness and greater asymptotic efficiency.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing algorithms by orders of magnitude and scales effectively to problems with millions of variables.

Conclusion: This new approach advances the state of DNF formula model counting by being more efficient and scalable, holding practical value for applications like probabilistic reasoning and databases.

Abstract: Model counting of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulas is a critical problem in applications such as probabilistic inference and network reliability. For example, it is often used for query evaluation in probabilistic databases. Due to the computational intractability of exact DNF counting, there has been a line of research into a variety of approximation algorithms. These include Monte Carlo approaches such as the classical algorithms of Karp, Luby, and Madras (1989), as well as methods based on hashing (Soos et al. 2023), and heuristic approximations based on Neural Nets (Abboud, Ceylan, and Lukasiewicz 2020).
  We develop a new Monte Carlo approach with an adaptive stopping rule and short-circuit formula evaluation. We prove it achieves Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning bounds and is asymptotically more efficient than the previous methods. We also show experimentally that it out-performs prior algorithms by orders of magnitude, and can scale to much larger problems with millions of variables.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an extension of the ChASE eigensolver to compute the spectrum of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, achieving scalability and efficiency suitable for modern systems while including new methods for faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The purpose of this work is to address the computational challenge of efficiently solving for thousands of eigenpairs of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which are essential in studying the optoelectronic structure of excitonic materials.

Method: The authors extend the ChASE eigensolver to handle pseudo-Hermitian matrices by proposing an oblique Rayleigh-Ritz projection method with quadratic convergence. They also optimize the parallel implementation of a recursive matrix-product operation for scalability.

Result: The pseudo-Hermitian ChASE solver demonstrates similar convergence and performance levels to its Hermitian counterpart. Enhancements allow effective exploration of the spectral properties of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians on modern exascale systems.

Conclusion: This work provides an advanced computational tool for studying pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, ensuring its scalability and efficiency for applications in material science research, particularly in excitonic materials, supported by theoretical and experimental validations.

Abstract: Studying the optoelectronic structure of materials can require the computation of up to several thousands of the smallest eigenpairs of a pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonian. Iterative eigensolvers may be preferred over direct methods for this task since their complexity is a function of the desired fraction of the spectrum. In addition, they generally rely on highly optimized and scalable kernels such as matrix-vector multiplications that leverage the massive parallelism and the computational power of modern exascale systems. \textit{Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver} (ChASE) is able to compute several thousands of the most extreme eigenpairs of dense hermitian matrices with proven scalability over massive parallel accelerated clusters. This work presents an extension of ChASE to solve for a portion of the spectrum of pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians as they appear in the treatment of excitonic materials. The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set. Additionally, we introduce a parallel implementation of the recursive matrix-product operation appearing in the Chebyshev filter with limited amount of global communications. Our development is supported by a full numerical analysis and experimental tests.

*Alena Kopaničáková,Elisa Riccietti*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper explores how optimization methods differ between machine learning (ML) and scientific machine learning (SciML), emphasizing the structural distinctions and algorithmic implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the structural differences in optimization problems between ML and SciML influence algorithmic choices, given SciML's unique challenges like global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy.

Method: Provides a comparative review of optimization techniques (first- and second-order, stochastic and deterministic), tailored for ML and SciML and offers practical strategies with examples.

Result: Highlights the limitations of standard stochastic methods in SciML and emphasizes the need for deterministic and curvature-aware approaches suited to physics-informed models.

Conclusion: Concludes that optimization methods must adapt to distinct problem structures in ML and SciML, underlining the importance of tailoring techniques and identifying directions for further research.

Abstract: Optimization is central to both modern machine learning (ML) and scientific machine learning (SciML), yet the structure of the underlying optimization problems differs substantially across these domains. Classical ML typically relies on stochastic, sample-separable objectives that favor first-order and adaptive gradient methods. In contrast, SciML often involves physics-informed or operator-constrained formulations in which differential operators induce global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy in the loss landscape. As a result, optimization behavior in SciML is governed by the spectral properties of the underlying physical models rather than by data statistics, frequently limiting the effectiveness of standard stochastic methods and motivating deterministic or curvature-aware approaches. This document provides a unified introduction to optimization methods in ML and SciML, emphasizing how problem structure shapes algorithmic choices. We review first- and second-order optimization techniques in both deterministic and stochastic settings, discuss their adaptation to physics-constrained and data-driven SciML models, and illustrate practical strategies through tutorial examples, while highlighting open research directions at the interface of scientific computing and scientific machine learning.

### [360] [Fundamental Limits of Coded Polynomial Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10028)
*Xi Zhong,Jörg Kliewer,Mingyue Ji*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper extends Coded Polynomial Aggregation (CPA) to straggler-aware distributed systems, introducing a framework that requires fewer worker responses for exact recovery of weighted polynomial aggregations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of straggler-aware distributed systems, where certain tasks may lag, by enabling efficient exact recovery of polynomial aggregations with a reduced number of worker responses.

Method: The authors develop a straggler-aware CPA framework with specific non-straggler patterns, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery. They identify an intersection-size threshold for feasibility and provide explicit constructions of CPA schemes when this threshold is met.

Result: The study shows that exact recovery is achievable with fewer worker responses compared to traditional methods, characterizing feasibility through intersection structure. Simulations verify that the predicted feasibility threshold aligns with practical performance.

Conclusion: The proposed straggler-aware CPA framework reduces required worker responses for exact recovery, supported by theoretical thresholds and empirical validation, making it efficient for distributed systems.

Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.

### [361] [Breaking the Storage-Bandwidth Tradeoff in Distributed Storage with Quantum Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10676)
*Lei Hu,Mohamed Nomeir,Alptug Aytekin,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The study explores improving distributed storage systems using quantum resources, focusing on quantum channels for file reconstruction and repair bandwidth. This approach enhances the storage-bandwidth tradeoff significantly, revealing new efficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address inefficiencies in classical distributed storage systems, particularly in storage and repair bandwidth, through the integration of quantum communication.

Method: The research introduces quantum communication channels among nodes and quantifies the storage and repair bandwidth tradeoff under quantum enhancements. It analyzes entanglement's impact, especially with $d \geq 2k-2$.

Result: Using quantum communication, the study identifies significant improvements in storage-bandwidth tradeoff compared to classical systems, especially at the minimum-storage regenerating point, and discovers simultaneous minimization of storage and repair bandwidth under specific conditions.

Conclusion: Quantum resources can fundamentally improve distributed storage systems' efficiency by exploiting quantum communication, revealing new operations and breaking classical tradeoff limitations.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.

### [362] [Critically Engaged Pragmatism: A Scientific Norm and Social, Pragmatist Epistemology for AI Science Evaluation Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09753)
*Carole J. Lee*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses challenges in the use of AI tools for evaluating scientific research, proposing a framework of Critically Engaged Pragmatism to ensure rigorous scrutiny of these tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by crises in peer review capacity, replication issues in studies, and the emergence of AI-generated scientific content, raising concerns about the misuse of automated evaluation tools.

Method: The author suggests adopting a social, pragmatist epistemology and the norm of Critically Engaged Pragmatism to address the flawed inferences and misuse surrounding AI-driven research evaluation tools.

Result: The paper identifies risks tied to the decontextualization and inappropriate application of AI science evaluation tools, emphasizing their susceptibility to contested purposes, lack of specificity, and overemphasis on data size.

Conclusion: AI science evaluation tools should not serve as final arbiters of credibility; instead, scientific communities must engage critically to scrutinize their purposes and reliability.

Abstract: Crises in peer review capacity, study replication, and AI-fabricated science have intensified interest in automated tools for assessing scientific research. However, the scientific community has a history of decontextualizing and repurposing credibility markers in inapt ways. I caution that AI science evaluation tools are particularly prone to these kinds of inference by false ascent due to contestation about the purposes to which they should be put, their portability across purposes, and technical demands that prioritize data set size over epistemic fit. To counter this, I argue for a social, pragmatist epistemology and a newly articulated norm of Critically Engaged Pragmatism to enjoin scientific communities to vigorously scrutinize the purposes and purpose-specific reliability of AI science evaluation tools. Under this framework, AI science evaluation tools are not objective arbiters of scientific credibility, but the object of the kinds of critical discursive practices that ground the credibility of scientific communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks posed to minority rights and interests by AI-driven privatization, prediction, and automation.

Method: Analyzes judicial review theories by examining cases where AI decisions have been legally challenged, emphasizing due process and equal protection integration.

Result: Provides insights into recuperating concepts for oversight and accountability, integrating them into judicial frameworks for AI.

Conclusion: Judicial review can be adapted to safeguard minorities from algorithmic discrimination by integrating accountability measures into AI systems.

Abstract: This essay examines how judicial review should adapt to address challenges posed by artificial intelligence decision-making, particularly regarding minority rights and interests. As I argue in this essay, the rise of three trends-privatization, prediction, and automation in AI-have combined to pose similar risks to minorities. Here, I outline what a theory of judicial review would look like in an era of artificial intelligence, analyzing both the limitations and the possibilities of judicial review of AI. I draw on cases in which AI decision-making has been challenged in courts, to show how concepts of due process and equal protection can be recuperated in a modern AI era, and even integrated into AI, to provide for better oversight and accountability, offering a framework for judicial review in the AI era that protects minorities from algorithmic discrimination.

### [364] [Differentially Private Inference for Longitudinal Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10626)
*Getoar Sopa,Marco Avella Medina,Cynthia Rush*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework for longitudinal linear regression under user-level differential privacy (DP), addressing challenges in protecting all data contributions from an individual user.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for differentially private linear regression primarily focus on item-level DP, which only protects individual observations. However, scientific and economic applications often require user-level DP to safeguard entire datasets contributed by individuals in longitudinal studies.

Method: The authors propose a user-level private regression estimator using aggregated local regressions. They also introduce a privatized, bias-corrected covariance estimator for heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent inference under dependence.

Result: The framework achieves finite-sample guarantees, ensures asymptotic normality, and offers improved empirical performance for user-level DP in longitudinal linear regression.

Conclusion: This paper provides a practical and theoretically grounded approach to user-level DP in longitudinal linear regression, enabling better estimation and inference while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for releasing statistics while protecting individual information present in a dataset. Although substantial progress has been made on differentially private linear regression, existing methods almost exclusively address the item-level DP setting, where each user contributes a single observation. Many scientific and economic applications instead involve longitudinal or panel data, in which each user contributes multiple dependent observations. In these settings, item-level DP offers inadequate protection, and user-level DP - shielding an individual's entire trajectory - is the appropriate privacy notion. We develop a comprehensive framework for estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under user-level DP. We propose a user-level private regression estimator based on aggregating local regressions, and we establish finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic normality under short-range dependence. For inference, we develop a privatized, bias-corrected covariance estimator that is automatically heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent. These results provide the first unified framework for practical user-level DP estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under dependence, with strong theoretical guarantees and promising empirical performance.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a challenge (CBVCC) focused on classifying microscopy videos of cellular behavior using varied techniques like feature-based, deep learning, and hybrid methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the capability of computer vision approaches in modeling shape, motion, and spatiotemporal features of cells in microscopy videos, which are critical for studying biological processes.

Method: Organized a challenge (CBVCC) where 35 methods were benchmarked based on three approaches: tracking-derived feature classification, end-to-end deep learning, and hybrid ensembling approaches.

Result: Highlighted the strengths and limitations of various methods, comparing their performance on classifying cellular behavior in microscopy videos.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights and directions to drive progress in computer vision methods for analyzing complex cellular dynamics.

Abstract: The classification of microscopy videos capturing complex cellular behaviors is crucial for understanding and quantifying the dynamics of biological processes over time. However, it remains a frontier in computer vision, requiring approaches that effectively model the shape and motion of objects without rigid boundaries, extract hierarchical spatiotemporal features from entire image sequences rather than static frames, and account for multiple objects within the field of view.
  To this end, we organized the Cell Behavior Video Classification Challenge (CBVCC), benchmarking 35 methods based on three approaches: classification of tracking-derived features, end-to-end deep learning architectures to directly learn spatiotemporal features from the entire video sequence without explicit cell tracking, or ensembling tracking-derived with image-derived features.
  We discuss the results achieved by the participants and compare the potential and limitations of each approach, serving as a basis to foster the development of computer vision methods for studying cellular dynamics.

### [366] [Multi-Objective Pareto-Front Optimization for Efficient Adaptive VVC Streaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10607)
*Angeliki Katsenou,Vignesh V. Menon,Guoda Laurinaviciute,Benjamin Bross,Detlev Marpe*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces efficient optimization strategies for adaptive video streaming through Pareto-front (PF) optimization. It achieves improvements in video quality and bitrate while ensuring manageable decoding complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance adaptive video streaming by optimizing the tradeoff between video quality, bitrate, and decoding complexity, aiming for sustainable and high-quality streaming.

Method: The paper proposes two PF-based optimization strategies: JRQT-PF and JQT-PF, focusing on different tradeoffs and applying quality monotonicity constraints during streaming.

Result: Experiments on UHD dataset show that JQT-PF reduces average bitrate by 11.76% with minimal decoding time impact, while JRQT-PF achieves 6.38% bitrate savings and 6.17% decoding time reduction, compared to fixed ladders.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances video streaming performance, proving superior to current benchmarks. It enables adaptive solutions tailored to network and device capabilities.

Abstract: Adaptive video streaming has facilitated improved video streaming over the past years. A balance among coding performance objectives such as bitrate, video quality, and decoding complexity is required to achieve efficient, content- and codec-dependent, adaptive video streaming. This paper proposes a multi-objective Pareto-front (PF) optimization framework to construct quality-monotonic, content-adaptive bitrate ladders Versatile Video Coding (VVC) streaming that jointly optimize video quality, bitrate, and decoding time, which is used as a practical proxy for decoding energy. Two strategies are introduced: the Joint Rate-Quality-Time Pareto Front (JRQT-PF) and the Joint Quality-Time Pareto Front (JQT-PF), each exploring different tradeoff formulations and objective prioritizations. The ladders are constructed under quality monotonicity constraints during adaptive streaming to ensure a consistent Quality of Experience (QoE). Experiments are conducted on a large-scale UHD dataset (Inter-4K), with quality assessed using PSNR, VMAF, and XPSNR, and complexity measured via decoding time and energy consumption. The JQT-PF method achieves 11.76% average bitrate savings while reducing average decoding time by 0.29% to maintain the same XPSNR, compared to a widely-used fixed ladder. More aggressive configurations yield up to 27.88% bitrate savings at the cost of increased complexity. The JRQT-PF strategy, on the other hand, offers more controlled tradeoffs, achieving 6.38 % bitrate savings and 6.17 % decoding time reduction. This framework outperforms existing methods, including fixed ladders, VMAF- and XPSNR-based dynamic resolution selection, and complexity-aware benchmarks. The results confirm that PF optimization with decoding time constraints enables sustainable, high-quality streaming tailored to network and device capabilities.

*Roya Khalili Amirabadi,Mohsen Jalaeian Farimani,Omid Solaymani Fard*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces SODACER, a reinforcement learning framework combining dual-buffer mechanisms, adaptive clustering, and Control Barrier Functions for optimized nonlinear system control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in reinforcement learning struggle with safe system trajectories and scalability in nonlinear systems, prompting the need for innovative solutions.

Method: The SODACER framework uses a Fast-Buffer for recent experiences, a Slow-Buffer with self-organizing adaptive clustering, and integrates Control Barrier Functions, along with the Sophia optimizer for enhanced learning stability.

Result: SODACER outperforms other replay methods in terms of faster convergence, better sample efficiency, and improved bias-variance trade-off, while ensuring safety constraints in dynamic environments like the HPV transmission model.

Conclusion: The study confirms SODACER’s efficacy in safe and scalable learning, making it applicable for robotics, healthcare, and complex nonlinear systems with validated advantages.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, named Self-Organizing Dual-buffer Adaptive Clustering Experience Replay (SODACER), designed to achieve safe and scalable optimal control of nonlinear systems. The proposed SODACER mechanism consisting of a Fast-Buffer for rapid adaptation to recent experiences and a Slow-Buffer equipped with a self-organizing adaptive clustering mechanism to maintain diverse and non-redundant historical experiences. The adaptive clustering mechanism dynamically prunes redundant samples, optimizing memory efficiency while retaining critical environmental patterns. The approach integrates SODASER with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee safety by enforcing state and input constraints throughout the learning process. To enhance convergence and stability, the framework is combined with the Sophia optimizer, enabling adaptive second-order gradient updates. The proposed SODACER-Sophia's architecture ensures reliable, effective, and robust learning in dynamic, safety-critical environments, offering a generalizable solution for applications in robotics, healthcare, and large-scale system optimization. The proposed approach is validated on a nonlinear Human Papillomavirus (HPV) transmission model with multiple control inputs and safety constraints. Comparative evaluations against random and clustering-based experience replay methods demonstrate that SODACER achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and a superior bias-variance trade-off, while maintaining safe system trajectories, validated via the Friedman test.

*Lorenzo Monti,Tatiana Muraveva,Brian Sheridan,Davide Massari,Alessia Garofalo,Gisella Clementini,Umberto Michelucci*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLiMB, a framework improving semi-supervised clustering by separately addressing known phenomena and novel structures, achieving superior results on astronomical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a clustering method that better distinguishes known phenomena and novel patterns, overcoming limitations of existing semi-supervised clustering approaches.

Method: The authors propose CLiMB, which uses a two-phase process: first, known clusters are anchored via constrained partitioning; then, density-based clustering identifies novel structures in remaining data.

Result: CLiMB achieved an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 compared to baselines (<0.20) and identified three novel astronomical features in Gaia Data Release 3.

Conclusion: CLiMB outperforms traditional methods in separating known and unknown patterns and demonstrates robust potential for scientific discovery in data-driven research.

Abstract: In data-driven scientific discovery, a challenge lies in classifying well-characterized phenomena while identifying novel anomalies. Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.

*Yuan-Sen Ting,André Curtis-Trudel,Siyu Yao*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: This paper discusses the implications of AI integration into astronomy, focusing on philosophical rather than purely engineering challenges, emphasizing its impact on scientific understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To navigate AI's integration into astronomy, addressing the epistemological challenges such as understanding, data assumptions, and validating AI's roles in research.

Method: Interdisciplinary workshop involving astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists to identify tensions and explore frameworks for integrating AI into astronomy.

Result: Several tensions in AI usage are highlighted: misunderstanding astronomy's goals, limitations in prediction-focused AI, human peer review necessity amidst AI content, challenges in breakthrough problem-finding, and potential shifts in research criteria due to AI capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper proposes 'pragmatic understanding' as a framework, advocating AI as a cognitive extension while shaping new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation in astronomy.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming astronomical research, yet the scientific community has largely treated this transformation as an engineering challenge rather than an epistemological one. This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy--conceptual clarity about what "understanding" means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will "derive fundamental physics" from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction--it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential--yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important. We propose "pragmatic understanding" as a framework for integration--recognizing AI as a tool that extends human cognition while requiring new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation. Engaging with these questions now may help the community shape the transformation rather than merely react to it.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Proposed a state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural network-based parallel decoding framework, overcoming throughput bottlenecks in real-time quantum error correction for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable and efficient decoder for real-time quantum error correction that can overcome the lack of parallelism and throughput issues in existing neural network decoders like AlphaQubit.

Method: Trained a transformer-based recurrent neural network tailored for parallel window decoding by deriving training labels from local corrections and training on varied decoding windows. This enabled self-coordination across neighboring windows.

Result: The decoder achieves SOTA accuracy and meets stringent throughput requirements for real-time quantum error correction. Benchmarked on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 quantum processor for surface codes with distances up to 7, the approach showed superior accuracy. Additionally, the approach enables decoding of distances up to 25 within 1 microsecond using a single TPU v6e.

Conclusion: This work presents the first scalable and efficient neural network-based parallel decoding framework suitable for real-time FTQC, demonstrating feasibility and significant advancements over previous approaches.

Abstract: Fast, reliable decoders are pivotal components for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.
  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that, using our approach, a single TPU v6e is capable of decoding surface codes with distances up to 25 within 1us per decoding round.

*Eyad I. B Hamid*

TL;DR: The paper introduces the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), which counteracts the Barren Plateau problem in Variational Quantum Algorithms while preserving entanglement and quantum state expressibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the Barren Plateau issue in variational quantum algorithms, which represents a major obstacle in the scalability of quantum machine learning and optimization.

Method: The proposed H-EFT-VA uses an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory and enforces a hierarchical initialization scheme (UV-cutoff), restricting state exploration and avoiding approximate unitary 2-designs.

Result: The H-EFT-VA guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on gradient variance, demonstrating improved energy convergence and ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze by factors of 109x and 10.7x, respectively, across 16 benchmarking experiments.

Conclusion: This approach resolves the Barren Plateau problem without sacrificing the necessary entanglement and expressibility of quantum algorithms, providing a highly efficient solution for practical quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are critically threatened by the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical "UV-cutoff" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\partial θ] \in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether neural information processing includes quantum-like properties using an information-theoretic test with autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if neural processes possess quantum-like properties, addressing an open question regarding their classical or quantum nature.

Method: The authors employ a model-agnostic, information-theoretic Bell-type test in the latent space of autoencoders, analyzing decoding statistics under various readout contexts.

Result: The proposed method enables testing the nonclassicality of neural systems through constraints on their information processing structure.

Conclusion: The research provides a novel experimental framework to probe quantum-like attributes in neural computation, shifting focus from microscopic to system-level information constraints.

Abstract: Whether neural information processing is entirely classical or involves quantum-mechanical elements remains an open question. Here we propose a model-agnostic, information-theoretic test of nonclassicality that bypasses microscopic assumptions and instead probes the structure of neural representations themselves. Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for speech-driven 3D facial animation often restrict emotional control to discrete categories, limiting expressiveness and smooth transitions.

Method: The framework employs boundary-aware semantic embedding to create a continuous emotion expression space and an emotional consistency loss to ensure alignment between motion and target emotion embedding.

Result: EditEmoTalk demonstrates enhanced controllability, expressiveness, generalization, and precise lip synchronization.

Conclusion: EditEmoTalk offers a novel solution for realistic facial animation with continuous emotion control, expanding the capabilities of speech-driven systems.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic and expressive facial motions directly from audio. While recent methods achieve high-quality lip synchronization, they often rely on discrete emotion categories, limiting continuous and fine-grained emotional control. We present EditEmoTalk, a controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation framework with continuous emotion editing. The key idea is a boundary-aware semantic embedding that learns the normal directions of inter-emotion decision boundaries, enabling a continuous expression manifold for smooth emotion manipulation. Moreover, we introduce an emotional consistency loss that enforces semantic alignment between the generated motion dynamics and the target emotion embedding through a mapping network, ensuring faithful emotional expression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditEmoTalk achieves superior controllability, expressiveness, and generalization while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Code and pretrained models will be released.

Method: A subjective quality assessment was conducted using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) methodology on 25 participants, with comparisons across enhancement layers representing 10% and 50% of the total bitrate.

Result: The results include Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with 95% confidence intervals, providing insights into the perceptual quality of the coding configurations tested.

Conclusion: LCEVC as an enhancement layer shows potential for improving video quality over a VVC base layer, depending on the operating points and bitrate allocations.

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a subjective quality assessment of a multilayer video coding configuration in which Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) is applied as an enhancement layer on top of a Versatile Video Coding (VVC) base layer. The evaluation follows the same test methodology and conditions previously defined for MPEG multilayer video coding assessments, with the LCEVC enhancement layer encoded using version 8.1 of the LCEVC Test Model (LTM). The test compares reconstructed UHD output generated from an HD VVC base layer with LCEVC enhancement against two reference cases: upsampled VVC base layer decoding and multilayer VVC (ML-VVC). Two operating points are considered, corresponding to enhancement layers representing approximately 10% and 50% of the total bitrate. Subjective assessment was conducted using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) methodology with twenty five participants, across a dataset comprising fifteen SDR and HDR sequences. The reported results include Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with associated 95% confidence intervals, enabling comparison of perceptual quality across coding approaches and operating points within the defined test scope.

Motivation: Current FL simulations face issues with unrealistic data partitioning and neglect of data correlation among users, which impacts model performance and applicability in real scenarios.

Method: Proposes a data partition model using a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) and a metadata-driven, clustering-based user selection strategy to improve label diversity and reduce data correlation.

Result: Demonstrates improved model performance, stability, and convergence on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in non-IID setups, while maintaining competitive results in IID situations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly enhances FL performance, particularly with fewer selected users per round, and provides insights for realistic FL deployments and standardization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw user data, but conventional simulations often rely on unrealistic data partitioning and current user selection methods ignore data correlation among users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.

### [376] [Sim2Real Deep Transfer for Per-Device CFO Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10264)
*Jingze Zheng,Zhiguo Shi,Shibo He,Chaojie Gu*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper presents a transfer learning framework for device-specific CFO calibration in OFDM systems, combining simulation-driven pretraining with lightweight adaptation for robust performance across SDR platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in CFO estimation occurs due to uncalibrated hardware impairments in SDR platforms, and existing DNN approaches fail at adapting to individual devices.

Method: A backbone DNN is pre-trained on synthetic OFDM signals with hardware distortions. Regression layers are then fine-tuned using real device data, enabling adaptation without extensive cross-device data collection.

Result: Experiments using three SDR families demonstrate $30\times$ BER reduction compared to conventional methods, showcasing effective device-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: The framework solves CFO estimation challenges across SDR platforms by bridging simulation and reality, facilitating cost-effective deployment and improved robustness in heterogeneous wireless systems.

Abstract: Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems faces significant performance degradation across heterogeneous software-defined radio (SDR) platforms due to uncalibrated hardware impairments. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based approaches lack device-level adaptation, limiting their practical deployment. This paper proposes a Sim2Real transfer learning framework for per-device CFO calibration, combining simulation-driven pretraining with lightweight receiver adaptation. A backbone DNN is pre-trained on synthetic OFDM signals incorporating parametric hardware distortions (e.g., phase noise, IQ imbalance), enabling generalized feature learning without costly cross-device data collection. Subsequently, only the regression layers are fine-tuned using $1,000$ real frames per target device, preserving hardware-agnostic knowledge while adapting to device-specific impairments. Experiments across three SDR families (USRP B210, USRP N210, HackRF One) achieve $30\times$ BER reduction compared to conventional CP-based methods under indoor multipath conditions. The framework bridges the simulation-to-reality gap for robust CFO estimation, enabling cost-effective deployment in heterogeneous wireless systems.
