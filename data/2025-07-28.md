### [1] [Initial Steps in Integrating Large Reasoning and Action Models for Service Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18775)
*Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes an integrated framework combining Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs) to address service composition challenges by leveraging their complementary strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in adaptive and intelligent systems, where limited reasoning and execution mechanisms hinder effective service composition.

Method: The authors propose a new architectural framework integrating LRMs for semantic reasoning and LAMs for dynamic action execution, aiming to overcome individual limitations of these paradigms.

Result: The paper demonstrates that combining LRMs and LAMs can facilitate reasoning about service needs and constraints while enabling dynamic workflow execution.

Conclusion: The integrated LRM-LAM system has the potential to automate service composition, making it user-friendly and driven by natural language intent.

Abstract: Service composition remains a central challenge in building adaptive and
intelligent software systems, often constrained by limited reasoning
capabilities or brittle execution mechanisms. This paper explores the
integration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs
address the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while
LAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,
each paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action
capabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an
integrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for
advancing automated service composition. Such a system can reason about service
requirements and constraints while dynamically executing workflows, thus
bridging the gap between intention and execution. This integration has the
potential to transform service composition into a fully automated,
user-friendly process driven by high-level natural language intent.

### [2] [Simulation-Driven Reinforcement Learning in Queuing Network Routing Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18795)
*Fatima Al-Ani,Molly Wang,Jevon Charles,Aaron Ong,Joshua Forday,Vinayak Modi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework leveraging Dyna-DDPG to optimize routing in complex queueing networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional queueing methods fail to handle dynamic and uncertain environments effectively, creating a need for innovative approaches.

Method: The authors developed a simulation-driven Dyna-DDPG framework involving separate predictive models for next-state transitions and rewards.

Result: The framework demonstrated robust and scalable performance in diverse experiments and large network scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach significantly enhances routing policies' efficiency and is reproducible and deployable in real-world systems.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of a simulation-driven reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for optimizing routing decisions in complex queueing
network systems, with a particular emphasis on manufacturing and communication
applications. Recognizing the limitations of traditional queueing methods,
which often struggle with dynamic, uncertain environments, we propose a robust
RL approach leveraging Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) combined with
Dyna-style planning (Dyna-DDPG). The framework includes a flexible and
configurable simulation environment capable of modeling diverse queueing
scenarios, disruptions, and unpredictable conditions. Our enhanced Dyna-DDPG
implementation incorporates separate predictive models for next-state
transitions and rewards, significantly improving stability and sample
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments and rigorous evaluations demonstrate the
framework's capability to rapidly learn effective routing policies that
maintain robust performance under disruptions and scale effectively to larger
network sizes. Additionally, we highlight strong software engineering practices
employed to ensure reproducibility and maintainability of the framework,
enabling practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

### [3] [A Neuroscience-Inspired Dual-Process Model of Compositional Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18868)
*Alex Noviello,Claas Beger,Jacob Groner,Kevin Ellis,Weinan Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRAGE, a brain-inspired AI framework achieving systematic compositional generalization, excelling in novel tasks through explicit schema use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of systematic compositional generalization, the paper draws inspiration from human cognitive processes involving the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

Method: The framework integrates a meta-trained Transformer Neural Decomposer for pattern recognition and a Schema Engine for schema extraction, ranking, and application. Together, they mimic brain processes for compositional reasoning.

Result: MIRAGE achieves > 99% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark with only 1.19M parameters, showing robust performance in novel task generalization.

Conclusion: The model's success underscores the importance of explicit schema management and iterative refinement for achieving systematic compositionality in AI systems.

Abstract: Systematic compositional generalization - constructing and understanding
novel combinations of known building blocks - remains a core challenge for AI
systems. Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the
hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes
episodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for
reasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with
Rules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves
systematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting
modules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive
neocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural
Decomposer, paralleling neocortical "System 1" computation, is trained on a
task-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one
decomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the
sequence representation. (2) The Schema Engine, analogous to the HPC-PFC
"System 2" loop, dynamically extracts, ranks, and applies reusable schemas,
storing variable bindings in episodic memory and expanding them when needed. By
explicitly equipping the Transformer component of MIRAGE with actively managed
schematic structures, our model performs systematic compositional operations
through explicit schema application and transformation, relying solely on
frozen weights when solving entirely novel tasks. This approach demonstrates
systematic compositional generalization on the SCAN benchmark, achieving > 99%
accuracy on all task splits with only 1.19M parameters in the transformer
module. Ablation studies confirm that MIRAGE's systematicity critically depends
on the quality of extracted schemas and the model's iterative refinement
process.

### [4] [Success in Humanoid Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18883)
*Wuhao Wang,Zhiyong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel history encoder enabling humanoid locomotion policy learning under partial observability, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to full state access models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of policy learning under partial observability in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion.

Method: The method involves a novel history encoder that processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel, integrated with a standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithm.

Result: The trained policy matches the performance of state-of-the-art models that use full state information, while utilizing only a fraction of the states. It also adapts to robot property variations, like body part mass changes.

Conclusion: The success of the history encoder demonstrates that reconstructing contextual information from past data enables effective and robust decision-making under partial observability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to robotic control, but
effective policy learning under partial observability remains a major
challenge, especially in high-dimensional tasks like humanoid locomotion. To
date, no prior work has demonstrated stable training of humanoid policies with
incomplete state information in the benchmark Gymnasium Humanoid-v4
environment. The objective in this environment is to walk forward as fast as
possible without falling, with rewards provided for staying upright and moving
forward, and penalties incurred for excessive actions and external contact
forces. This research presents the first successful instance of learning under
partial observability in this environment. The learned policy achieves
performance comparable to state-of-the-art results with full state access,
despite using only one-third to two-thirds of the original states. Moreover,
the policy exhibits adaptability to robot properties, such as variations in
body part masses. The key to this success is a novel history encoder that
processes a fixed-length sequence of past observations in parallel. Integrated
into a standard model-free algorithm, the encoder enables performance on par
with fully observed baselines. We hypothesize that it reconstructs essential
contextual information from recent observations, thereby enabling robust
decision-making.

### [5] [Towards Improving Long-Tail Entity Predictions in Temporal Knowledge Graphs through Global Similarity and Weighted Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18977)
*Mehrnoosh Mirtaheri,Ryan A. Rossi,Sungchul Kim,Kanak Mahadik,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Mohammad Rostami*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an incremental training framework for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) to tackle challenges with unseen or sparsely connected entities during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of traditional TKG completion models, which cannot generalize well as knowledge graphs evolve or handle new/unseen entities effectively due to sparse connections.

Method: The approach integrates a model-agnostic enhancement layer and a weighted sampling strategy. The enhancement layer uses a global definition of entity similarity, while weighted sampling prioritizes rare or sparsely connected entities.

Result: The proposed framework outperformed existing methods on two benchmark datasets, showing a 10% overall improvement and a 15% boost in mean reciprocal rank (MRR).

Conclusion: The results highlight the framework's success in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and its robustness for incremental TKG completion, with strong performance in inductive link prediction and long-tail entity prediction.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) completion models traditionally assume access
to the entire graph during training. This overlooks challenges stemming from
the evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize
and assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen
entities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an
incremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to
address entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse
connections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a
weighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing
TKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global
definition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood
proximity of GNN-based methods. The weighted sampling strategy employed in
training accentuates edges linked to infrequently occurring entities. We
evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that our
framework outperforms existing methods in total link prediction, inductive link
prediction, and in addressing long-tail entities. Notably, our method achieves
a 10\% improvement and a 15\% boost in MRR for these datasets. The results
underscore the potential of our approach in mitigating catastrophic forgetting
and enhancing the robustness of TKG completion methods, especially in an
incremental training context

### [6] [Fine-Grained Traffic Inference from Road to Lane via Spatio-Temporal Graph Node Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19089)
*Shuhao Li,Weidong Yang,Yue Cui,Xiaoxing Liu,Lingkai Meng,Lipeng Ma,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method called RoadDiff to infer detailed lane-level traffic data using minimal road information for improved traffic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane-level traffic data acquisition is limited by sensor capabilities and tracking algorithm accuracy, hindering effective traffic management applications like autonomous driving and signal control.

Method: The authors propose a Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task and present a two-stage framework named RoadDiff. The framework employs a Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and a Lane Diffusion Module to utilize spatio-temporal data and relationships for detailed traffic state inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on six diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model for lane-level traffic inference.

Conclusion: RoadDiff successfully addresses the FRTI task, providing a cost-efficient and precise method to infer detailed traffic conditions. The code and datasets are openly available for further research.

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The
relevant datasets and code are available at

### [7] [Pareto-NRPA: A Novel Monte-Carlo Search Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19109)
*Noé Lallouet,Tristan Cazenave,Cyrille Enderli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Pareto-NRPA, a Monte Carlo algorithm for multi-objective optimization, extending NRPA from single- to multi-objective settings. It benchmarks well against state-of-the-art methods, especially in constrained spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) is limited to single-objective optimization, leaving a gap in multi-objective discrete search space problems that demand efficient exploration and maintenance of diverse solution fronts.

Method: The authors extend NRPA by generalizing the nested search and policy update mechanisms for multi-objective optimization. They introduce policies to explore solution space concurrently and maintain Pareto fronts, optimizing for both diversity and isolation.

Result: Pareto-NRPA demonstrates competitive performance, surpassing evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained problems. It successfully handles the bi-objective MO-TSPTW and neural architecture search with strong convergence metrics and solution diversity.

Conclusion: Pareto-NRPA significantly advances the capability of NRPA by broadening its application to multi-objective optimization. It sets a competitive benchmark for tackling such problems and solidifies its role in constrained multi-objective settings.

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for
multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending
the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for
single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy
update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of
policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and
maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is
performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the
Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel
bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows
problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known
benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive
performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms
of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly
outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on
constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first
adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

### [8] [OS-MAP: How Far Can Computer-Using Agents Go in Breadth and Depth?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19132)
*Xuetian Chen,Yinghao Chen,Xinfeng Yuan,Zhuo Peng,Lu Chen,Yuekeng Li,Zhoujia Zhang,Yingqian Huang,Leyan Huang,Jiaqing Liang,Tianbao Xie,Zhiyong Wu,Qiushi Sun,Biqing Qi,Bowen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces OS-MAP, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-using agents across 416 tasks grouped by automation levels and user demand hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for computer-using agents fail to address task heterogeneity or align capabilities with real-world demands, limiting advancements in targeted capability development and deployment.

Method: The benchmark organizes tasks into a five-level automation taxonomy and generalization scope based on user demand hierarchies, offering structured evaluations of agent autonomy and generalization capabilities.

Result: State-of-the-Art agents, even with advanced VLM backbones, face challenges in higher-level tasks requiring complex perception, reasoning, and coordination.

Conclusion: OS-MAP provides a detailed performance framework to better understand agent limitations and strengths, facilitating progress in agent research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,
environments, baselines, and data are publicly available at

### [9] [PhysDrive: A Multimodal Remote Physiological Measurement Dataset for In-vehicle Driver Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19172)
*Jiyao Wang,Xiao Yang,Qingyong Hu,Jiankai Tang,Can Liu,Dengbo He,Yuntao Wang,Yingcong Chen,Kaishun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysDrive is the first large-scale multimodal dataset designed for contactless in-vehicle physiological monitoring, overcoming previous limitations in scale, variety, and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of comprehensive datasets for remote physiological measurement and create a solution to facilitate robust in-vehicle monitoring.

Method: Developed PhysDrive, a multimodal dataset collected from 48 drivers, incorporating diverse driving modalities, naturalistic conditions, and synchronized biometric ground truths.

Result: PhysDrive includes synchronized RGB, near-infrared, radar data, and diverse driving conditions, accompanied by robust evaluations using signal-processing and deep-learning methods.

Conclusion: PhysDrive is anticipated to accelerate multimodal driver monitoring research, providing an open-source, benchmarkable platform for smart-cockpit innovations.

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,
and SpO2). It covers a wide spectrum of naturalistic driving conditions,
including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road
conditions. We extensively evaluate both signal-processing and deep-learning
methods on PhysDrive, establishing a comprehensive benchmark across all
modalities, and release full open-source code with compatibility for mainstream
public toolboxes. We envision PhysDrive will serve as a foundational resource
and accelerate research on multimodal driver monitoring and smart-cockpit
systems.

### [10] [Faster Lifting for Ordered Domains with Predecessor Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19182)
*Kuncheng Zou,Jiahao Mai,Yonggang Zhang,Yuyi Wang,Ondřej Kuželka,Yuanhong Wang,Yi Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper develops a novel algorithm for lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor relations, achieving significant speedups over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC) algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly involving predecessor relations, despite theoretical tractability.

Method: A novel algorithm is proposed that integrates predecessor relations into the axiom, offering exponential speedup for immediate, second, and general k-th predecessor relations.

Result: The algorithm achieves efficiency improvements by a full order of magnitude across multiple lifted inference tasks and combinatorics problems.

Conclusion: The approach enhances tractability and practical usability of WFOMC algorithms for problems involving ordered domains and predecessor relations.

Abstract: We investigate lifted inference on ordered domains with predecessor
relations, where the elements of the domain respect a total (cyclic) order, and
every element has a distinct (clockwise) predecessor. Previous work has
explored this problem through weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC),
which computes the weighted sum of models for a given first-order logic
sentence over a finite domain. In WFOMC, the order constraint is typically
encoded by the linear order axiom introducing a binary predicate in the
sentence to impose a linear ordering on the domain elements. The immediate and
second predecessor relations are then encoded by the linear order predicate.
Although WFOMC with the linear order axiom is theoretically tractable, existing
algorithms struggle with practical applications, particularly when the
predecessor relations are involved. In this paper, we treat predecessor
relations as a native part of the axiom and devise a novel algorithm that
inherently supports these relations. The proposed algorithm not only provides
an exponential speedup for the immediate and second predecessor relations,
which are known to be tractable, but also handles the general k-th predecessor
relations. The extensive experiments on lifted inference tasks and
combinatorics math problems demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm,
achieving speedups of a full order of magnitude.

### [11] [Knowledge Grafting: A Mechanism for Optimizing AI Model Deployment in Resource-Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19261)
*Osama Almurshed,Ashish Kaushal,Asmail Muftah,Nitin Auluck,Omer Rana*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents "knowledge grafting," a method to optimize AI for resource-constrained environments by transferring features from larger models to smaller ones, achieving a significant reduction in size while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying increasingly large and complex AI models in resource-constrained scenarios, where computing power is limited.

Method: The method involves knowledge grafting, where selected features from a large donor AI model are transferred to a smaller rootstock model, enabling significant size reduction without performance compromise.

Result: The approach reduced the model size by 88.54% (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), improved validation accuracy from 87.47% to 89.97%, and achieved better generalization with an accuracy of 90.45% on unseen test data.

Conclusion: Knowledge grafting successfully addresses the size vs. performance trade-off, making AI deployment feasible in constrained environments. While demonstrated in agricultural weed detection, it can be applied to other edge computing domains.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to larger,
more complex models with numerous parameters that require substantial computing
power -- resources often unavailable in many real-world application scenarios.
Our paper addresses this challenge by introducing knowledge grafting, a novel
mechanism that optimizes AI models for resource-constrained environments by
transferring selected features (the scion) from a large donor model to a
smaller rootstock model. The approach achieves an 88.54% reduction in model
size (from 64.39 MB to 7.38 MB), while improving generalization capability of
the model. Our new rootstock model achieves 89.97% validation accuracy (vs.
donor's 87.47%), maintains lower validation loss (0.2976 vs. 0.5068), and
performs exceptionally well on unseen test data with 90.45% accuracy. It
addresses the typical size vs performance trade-off, and enables deployment of
AI frameworks on resource-constrained devices with enhanced performance. We
have tested our approach on an agricultural weed detection scenario, however,
it can be extended across various edge computing scenarios, potentially
accelerating AI adoption in areas with limited hardware/software support -- by
mirroring in a similar manner the horticultural grafting enables productive
cultivation in challenging agri-based environments.

### [12] [Modeling Uncertainty: Constraint-Based Belief States in Imperfect-Information Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19263)
*Achille Morenville,Éric Piette*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores two methods to represent belief states in imperfect-information games, finding comparable results between constraint-based and probabilistic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-making in imperfect-information games is challenging due to partial knowledge of the state. The paper aims to simplify state estimation using external belief models.

Method: Investigates two techniques: Constraint Satisfaction Problems for constraint-based beliefs and Belief Propagation for probabilistic inference. Evaluates their impact using general-purpose agents in two games.

Result: Agents showed comparable performance using either constraint-based or probabilistic belief representations, with minimal differences in results.

Conclusion: Constraint-based belief states are sufficient for effective decision-making, potentially eliminating the need for complex probabilistic inference in many games.

Abstract: In imperfect-information games, agents must make decisions based on partial
knowledge of the game state. The Belief Stochastic Game model addresses this
challenge by delegating state estimation to the game model itself. This allows
agents to operate on externally provided belief states, thereby reducing the
need for game-specific inference logic. This paper investigates two approaches
to represent beliefs in games with hidden piece identities: a constraint-based
model using Constraint Satisfaction Problems and a probabilistic extension
using Belief Propagation to estimate marginal probabilities. We evaluated the
impact of both representations using general-purpose agents across two
different games. Our findings indicate that constraint-based beliefs yield
results comparable to those of probabilistic inference, with minimal
differences in agent performance. This suggests that constraint-based belief
states alone may suffice for effective decision-making in many settings.

*Patrick Taillandier,Jean Daniel Zucker,Arnaud Grignard,Benoit Gaudou,Nghi Quang Huynh,Alexis Drogoul*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social simulation, highlighting cognitive capabilities, challenges, emerging applications, and advocating for hybrid modeling approaches combining LLMs with rule-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the applicability and limitations of LLMs in computational social science, particularly in replicating human cognition and aiding multi-agent simulations.

Method: The paper reviews recent findings on LLM capabilities, surveys applications in multi-agent simulations, discusses challenges, and compares their use in different contexts.

Result: The analysis identifies strengths in interactive simulations but limitations in predictive modeling, drawing attention to challenges like behavioral fidelity and reproducibility.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional agent-based modeling platforms are recommended to leverage the strengths of both language-based reasoning and rule-based systems.

Abstract: This position paper examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
social simulation, analyzing both their potential and their limitations from a
computational social science perspective. The first part reviews recent
findings on the ability of LLMs to replicate key aspects of human cognition,
including Theory of Mind reasoning and social inference, while also
highlighting significant limitations such as cognitive biases, lack of true
understanding, and inconsistencies in behavior. The second part surveys
emerging applications of LLMs in multi-agent simulation frameworks, focusing on
system architectures, scale, and validation strategies. Notable projects such
as Generative Agents (Smallville) and AgentSociety are discussed in terms of
their design choices, empirical grounding, and methodological innovations.
Particular attention is given to the challenges of behavioral fidelity,
calibration, and reproducibility in large-scale LLM-driven simulations. The
final section distinguishes between contexts where LLMs, like other black-box
systems, offer direct value-such as interactive simulations and serious
games-and those where their use is more problematic, notably in explanatory or
predictive modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for hybrid approaches
that integrate LLMs into traditional agent-based modeling platforms (GAMA,
Netlogo, etc), enabling modelers to combine the expressive flexibility of
language-based reasoning with the transparency and analytical rigor of
classical rule-based systems.

Motivation: Address the challenge in AI to build neural systems capable of learning symbolic algorithms with robust generalization and out-of-distribution performance.

Method: Introduce neuro-symbolic architectures inspired by term rewriting systems, specifically Neural Rewriting System (NRS) and FastNRS, for algorithmic inspired design and modular implementations.

Result: Both architectures surpass Neural Data Router and GPT-4 models in performance across tasks, while FastNRS excels in efficiency and versatility across multiple domains.

Conclusion: The proposed systems provide a scalable and effective solution for learning symbolic algorithms, offering both domain versatility and superior performance.

Abstract: Building neural systems that can learn to execute symbolic algorithms is a
challenging open problem in artificial intelligence, especially when aiming for
strong generalization and out-of-distribution performance. In this work, we
introduce a general framework for learning convergent term rewriting systems
using a neuro-symbolic architecture inspired by the rewriting algorithm itself.
We present two modular implementations of such architecture: the Neural
Rewriting System (NRS) and the Fast Neural Rewriting System (FastNRS). As a
result of algorithmic-inspired design and key architectural elements, both
models can generalize to out-of-distribution instances, with FastNRS offering
significant improvements in terms of memory efficiency, training speed, and
inference time. We evaluate both architectures on four tasks involving the
simplification of mathematical formulas and further demonstrate their
versatility in a multi-domain learning scenario, where a single model is
trained to solve multiple types of problems simultaneously. The proposed system
significantly outperforms two strong neural baselines: the Neural Data Router,
a recent transformer variant specifically designed to solve algorithmic
problems, and GPT-4o, one of the most powerful general-purpose large-language
models. Moreover, our system matches or outperforms the latest o1-preview model
from OpenAI that excels in reasoning benchmarks.

### [15] [Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-Year Asset Management Under Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19458)
*Amir Fard,Arnold X. -X. Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning methodology for multi-year infrastructure asset management, improving scalability and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in infrastructure asset management caused by complex action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, budget constraints, and environmental uncertainties.

Method: The problem is divided into two hierarchical levels: high-level budget planning using budget allocation and low-level maintenance planning for asset prioritization, leveraging a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework with linear programming projection.

Result: The method is applied to sewer network case studies and outperforms Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms in convergence speed, scalability, and maintaining near-optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively streamlines the decision-making process for infrastructure management, ensuring better scalability and cost-effectiveness under complex constraints.

Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure
asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the
complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset
deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty
significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to
multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into
two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets
within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner
prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating
macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear
programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the
method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures
rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying
sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic
algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and
consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.

### [16] [RailX: A Flexible, Scalable, and Low-Cost Network Architecture for Hyper-Scale LLM Training Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18889)
*Yinxiao Feng,Tiancheng Chen,Yuchen Wei,Siyuan Shen,Shiju Wang,Wei Li,Kaisheng Ma,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: RailX is a reconfigurable network architecture designed to meet the scalability and cost-effectiveness demands of hyper-scale AI workloads. It employs 2D physical organization, intra-node direct connectivity, and inter-node circuit switching to optimize network performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyper-scale AI workloads require scalable and cost-effective network infrastructure. Conventional tree-based and direct topologies either fall short in scalability or are too costly, necessitating a new approach.

Method: RailX integrates intra-node direct connectivity with inter-node circuit switching. It applies Hamiltonian decomposition theory to organize rail-based rings into all-to-all topologies for optimized communication. It achieves 2D physical node and optical switch organization.

Result: RailX offers significant cost and scalability advantages: interconnecting over 200K chips with 1.8TB bandwidth requires only $1.3B. Its cost per bandwidth metric is much lower than that of Fat-Tree networks, with small inter-node hop diameters (2~4).

Conclusion: By providing scalability, cost efficiency, and flexibility for AI workloads, RailX is well-suited for hyper-scale ML training tasks and adaptable for ML-as-a-service deployments. Failures can also be effectively mitigated.

Abstract: Increasingly large AI workloads are calling for hyper-scale infrastructure;
however, traditional interconnection network architecture is neither scalable
nor cost-effective enough. Tree-based topologies such as the
\textit{Rail-optimized} network are extremely expensive, while direct
topologies such as \textit{Torus} have insufficient bisection bandwidth and
flexibility. In this paper, we propose \textit{RailX}, a reconfigurable network
architecture based on intra-node direct connectivity and inter-node circuit
switching. Nodes and optical switches are physically 2D-organized, achieving
better scalability than existing centralized circuit switching networks. We
propose a novel interconnection method based on \textit{Hamiltonian
Decomposition} theory to organize separate rail-based rings into
\textit{all-to-all} topology, simultaneously optimizing ring-collective and
all-to-all communication. More than $100$K chips with hyper bandwidth can be
interconnected with a flat switching layer, and the diameter is only $2\sim4$
inter-node hops. The network cost per injection/All-Reduce bandwidth of
\textit{RailX} is less than $10\%$ of the Fat-Tree, and the cost per
bisection/All-to-All bandwidth is less than $50\%$ of the Fat-Tree.
Specifically, only $\sim$\$$1.3$B is required to interconnect 200K chips with
1.8TB bandwidth. \textit{RailX} can also be used in the ML-as-a-service (MLaaS)
scenario, where single or multiple training workloads with various shapes,
scales, and parallelism strategies can be flexibly mapped, and failures can be
worked around.

### [17] [3DGauCIM: Accelerating Static/Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting via Digital CIM for High Frame Rate Real-Time Edge Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19133)
*Wei-Hsing Huang,Cheng-Jhih Shih,Jian-Wei Su,Samuel Wade Wang,Vaidehi Garg,Yuyao Kong,Jen-Chun Tien,Nealson Li,Arijit Raychowdhury,Meng-Fan Chang,Yingyan,Lin,Shimeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables rendering of dynamic scenes for AR/VR but faces performance and energy challenges on edge devices due to DRAM access, sorting latency, buffer capacity, and DCIM compatibility issues. Algorithm-hardware co-design techniques are proposed to address these challenges, achieving high framerates and low power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rendering dynamic scenes for AR/VR applications using Dynamic 3DGS on edge devices faces significant challenges related to energy efficiency, latency, and compatibility with memory architectures.

Method: The paper introduces three algorithmic optimizations—DRAM-access reduction frustum culling, adaptive tile grouping, and adaptive sorting—to improve computational efficiency. It also designs a hardware-friendly computation flow compatible with Digital Compute-In-Memory (DCIM).

Result: The proposed techniques achieve over 200 FPS real-time rendering with low power consumption: 0.28 W for static scenes and 0.63 W for dynamic scenes, validated on a prototype chip and large-scale datasets.

Conclusion: The co-design approach effectively addresses performance and power challenges, enabling efficient implementation of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting for edge devices.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) extends static 3DGS to render dynamic
scenes, enabling AR/VR applications with moving objects. However, implementing
dynamic 3DGS on edge devices faces challenges: (1) Loading all Gaussian
parameters from DRAM for frustum culling incurs high energy costs. (2)
Increased parameters for dynamic scenes elevate sorting latency and energy
consumption. (3) Limited on-chip buffer capacity with higher parameters reduces
buffer reuse, causing frequent DRAM access. (4) Dynamic 3DGS operations are not
readily compatible with digital compute-in-memory (DCIM). These challenges
hinder real-time performance and power efficiency on edge devices, leading to
reduced battery life or requiring bulky batteries. To tackle these challenges,
we propose algorithm-hardware co-design techniques. At the algorithmic level,
we introduce three optimizations: (1) DRAM-access reduction frustum culling to
lower DRAM access overhead, (2) Adaptive tile grouping to enhance on-chip
buffer reuse, and (3) Adaptive interval initialization Bucket-Bitonic sort to
reduce sorting latency. At the hardware level, we present a DCIM-friendly
computation flow that is evaluated using the measured data from a 16nm DCIM
prototype chip. Our experimental results on Large-Scale Real-World
Static/Dynamic Datasets demonstrate the ability to achieve high frame rate
real-time rendering exceeding 200 frame per second (FPS) with minimal power
consumption, merely 0.28 W for static Large-Scale Real-World scenes and 0.63 W
for dynamic Large-Scale Real-World scenes. This work successfully addresses the
significant challenges of implementing static/dynamic 3DGS technology on
resource-constrained edge devices.

### [18] [A3D-MoE: Acceleration of Large Language Models with Mixture of Experts via 3D Heterogeneous Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19142)
*Wei-Hsing Huang,Janak Sharda,Cheng-Jhih Shih,Yuyao Kong,Faaiq Waqar,Pin-Jun Chen,Yingyan,Lin,Shimeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper proposes A3D-MoE, a system to address efficiency, latency, and energy issues in Mixture-of-Experts-based LLMs through innovative hardware and scheduling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from challenges in MoE-based large language models including inefficient memory usage, irregular hardware utilization, and high energy costs during inference.

Method: A3D-MoE employs vertical integration technology, adaptive systolic arrays, scheduling enhancements, and memory access optimizations to tackle inefficiencies.

Result: Evaluation results show reduced latency (1.8x to 2x), energy consumption (2x to 4x), and improved throughput (1.44x to 1.8x).

Conclusion: A3D-MoE is an effective hardware architecture and scheduling solution to improve the efficiency of fine-grained MoE-based LLM inference.

Abstract: Conventional large language models (LLMs) are equipped with dozens of GB to
TB of model parameters, making inference highly energy-intensive and costly as
all the weights need to be loaded to onboard processing elements during
computation. Recently, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as
an efficient alternative, promising efficient inference with less activated
weights per token. Nevertheless, fine-grained MoE-based LLMs face several
challenges: 1) Variable workloads during runtime create arbitrary GEMV-GEMM
ratios that reduce hardware utilization, 2) Traditional MoE-based scheduling
for LLM serving cannot fuse attention operations with MoE operations, leading
to increased latency and decreased hardware utilization, and 3) Despite being
more efficient than conventional LLMs, loading experts from DRAM still consumes
significant energy and requires substantial DRAM bandwidth. Addressing these
challenges, we propose: 1) A3D-MoE, a 3D Heterogeneous Integration system that
employs state-of-the-art vertical integration technology to significantly
enhance memory bandwidth while reducing Network-on-Chip (NoC) overhead and
energy consumption. 2) A 3D-Adaptive GEMV-GEMM-ratio systolic array with
V-Cache efficient data reuse and a novel unified 3D dataflow to solve the
problem of reduced hardware utilization caused by arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios
from different workloads, 3) A Hardware resource-aware operation fusion
scheduler that fuses attention operations with MoE operations to enhance
hardware performance, and 4) MoE Score-Aware HBM access reduction with even-odd
expert placement that reduces DRAM access and bandwidth requirements. Our
evaluation results indicate that A3D-MoE delivers significant performance
enhancements, reducing latency by a factor of 1.8x to 2x and energy consumption
by 2x to 4x, while improving throughput by 1.44x to 1.8x compared to the
state-of-the-art.

### [19] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a framework for improving language models' alignment by dynamically fixing flawed guiding specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often exploit flaws in poorly written specifications, resulting in undesired behavior. The motivation is to address this issue and align the model outcomes with the user's true intent.

Method: SSC is a test-time framework where the model generates an output using a possibly flawed specification, critiques the output, revises the specification to fix loopholes, and finally generates a robust response based on the corrected specification.

Result: Experiments showed that while models initially exploited tainted specifications in 50-70% of cases, SSC successfully reduced this vulnerability by over 90%.

Conclusion: SSC allows language models to dynamically repair flawed guiding specifications without weight modifications, improving their alignment and robustness.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

### [20] [The Role of Orthographic Consistency in Multilingual Embedding Models for Text Classification in Arabic-Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18762)
*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces script-aware pre-trained models (AS-RoBERTa) tailored for Arabic-script languages, demonstrating significant performance improvements over multilingual models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual NLP models struggle with languages sharing the same script but differing in orthography and context, especially for Arabic-script languages such as Sorani, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu.

Method: The authors developed four RoBERTa-based models each pre-trained on large language-specific corpora, emphasizing script features and statistics. They then evaluated performance on classification tasks and conducted an ablation study and error analysis.

Result: AS-RoBERTa variants achieved 2-5 percentage points higher performance compared to mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa on classification tasks.

Conclusion: Script-aware specialization improves model performance for Arabic-script languages, encouraging future research to integrate script and language-specific strategies in pre-training.

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multilingual text detoxification pipeline developed for the PAN-2025 competition, which integrates lexicon-guided tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model, and a classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve multilingual text detoxification by leveraging explicit toxic word annotation for better precision and cross-lingual generalization.

Method: The authors combine lexicon-guided tagging, fine-tuning a sequence-to-sequence model, and an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism.

Result: The final model achieved high detoxification scores across multiple metrics (STA: 0.922, J score: 0.612, xCOMET scores around 0.79) and demonstrated strong performance in high-resource languages.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperformed baseline methods, showcasing strong cross-lingual generalization and robustness, with some trade-offs in text similarity (SIM).

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

*Yilun Yang,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) on code-mixed data across 18 languages and proposes a new method for generating synthetic code-mixed texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-mixing is crucial for multilingual users, but existing benchmarks and research on LLM capabilities in this context are limited.

Method: The authors evaluate LLMs on code-mixed data spanning diverse language families and create a new approach for generating synthetic code-mixed texts by blending word substitution and GPT-4 prompting.

Result: LLMs show consistent underperformance on code-mixed datasets, especially for languages across multiple families.

Conclusion: Enhancing training data, model scale, and few-shot learning could improve LLM performance on code-mixed tasks.

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

TL;DR: This paper presents CueBuddy, a system offering real-time lexical cues during STEM lectures to aid students less fluent in English by detecting technical terms and providing multilingual glossaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the educational gap for STEM students in the Global South who are disadvantaged by limited English fluency in understanding technical terminology, despite equivalency in scientific background.

Method: CueBuddy employs real-time technical keyword spotting and a multilingual glossary lookup to deliver lexical cues to students during lectures without distraction.

Result: CueBuddy enables students to keep pace with English-heavy STEM courses by simplifying the understanding of technical terms through real-time support.

Conclusion: Real-time lexical aids like CueBuddy can bridge the language gap for STEM students in under-resourced regions, though further research and extensions are needed to refine this approach.

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PrismRAG, an improved fine-tuning framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to address the issues of confusing retrieved contexts and promote reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in RAG approaches, where confusing passages and limited reasoning hinder performance in answering complex questions.

Method: PrismRAG fine-tunes models by training on distractor-aware QA pairs and encouraging reasoning-centric processes without heavy reliance on predefined instructions.

Result: PrismRAG demonstrated a 5.4% average improvement in factuality across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art outcomes.

Conclusion: Introducing reasoning and distractor-awareness into RAG models enhances their factuality and reliability in handling diverse QA scenarios, closing key gaps in retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MindFlow+, a dialogue agent for e-commerce customer service, combining large language models with imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges traditional intent-based systems face in dynamic, multi-turn e-commerce interactions, aiming for high-quality dialogue.

Method: MindFlow+ integrates tool-augmented demonstrations for knowledge-enhanced interactions and reward-conditioned data modeling to align outputs with task goals. Experiments utilized real-world e-commerce dialogues to evaluate the improvements.

Result: MindFlow+ surpasses baseline systems in contextual relevance, flexibility, and task accuracy in e-commerce dialogues.

Conclusion: MindFlow+ demonstrates the effectiveness of combining LLMs, tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning in creating advanced, domain-specific, context-aware dialogue systems.

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG is a new Bayesian model that addresses annotator disagreements in NLP training data by removing noise while preserving systematic disagreements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional aggregation methods treat annotator disagreements as errors, ignoring the signal that can be present in genuine disagreements.

Method: The paper introduces NUTMEG, a Bayesian model leveraging annotator background information to distinguish between noise and systematic disagreements in human-labeled data.

Result: NUTMEG outperforms traditional aggregation methods in recovering ground-truth from systematically disagreed annotations and enhances downstream model performance.

Conclusion: Accountability for annotator competence and systematic disagreement is crucial for more accurate NLP models trained on human-labeled data.

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces REPRO-Bench, a benchmark for automating the reproducibility assessment of social science papers using AI agents, showing existing agents achieve low accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing reproducibility of social science papers is essential for research rigor but manual methods are costly and AI solutions face limitations.

Method: Introduced REPRO-Bench, a dataset with 112 instances of social science papers and reproduction reports, and evaluated AI agents on their reproducibility assessment ability.

Result: The best-performing AI agent achieved only 21.4% accuracy, while the new REPRO-Agent raised performance by 71%.

Conclusion: AI agents currently show limited capability in assessing reproducibility, and further advancements are needed for real-world applicability.

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly

<details>

Motivation: Current LLMs support only hundreds of the 7,000+ global languages, and dictionary-based translation methods often consume excessive resources by using all dictionaries.

Method: The proposed method, SLoW, selects dictionaries focusing on low-frequency words without needing access to training data or additional LLM tuning.

Result: SLoW demonstrated better translation performance and lower token usage than strong baselines in experiments on 100 languages from the FLORES dataset.

Conclusion: SLoW effectively optimizes dictionary usage, improving translation and resource efficiency, proving practical even without training data.

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the medical safety of four large language model (LLM) chatbots and discovers significant variation in the rates of problematic and unsafe responses to patient queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the growing use of LLM chatbots for medical advice, raising concerns about patient safety and the quality of advice provided.

Method: The researchers conducted a physician-led red-teaming evaluation of four public chatbots using their newly created 'HealthAdvice' dataset to assess 888 responses to 222 medical questions across various primary care topics.

Result: The study found significant differences between chatbots, with problematic response rates ranging from 21.6% to 43.2%, and unsafe responses varying between 5% and 13% depending on the chatbot.

Conclusion: Millions of patients may be receiving unsafe medical advice from chatbots, indicating an urgent need for improving the clinical safety and reliability of such tools.

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for generating creative captions for images by mining contextualized associations, and uses this to improve vision-language models while enabling abstraction in generated captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the association and captioning capabilities of vision-language models by addressing limitations of current datasets, which mostly contain literal short alt-text.

Method: Developed a scalable approach to mine associations for visual elements within unlabeled images, using these mined associations to create creative captions at various levels of abstraction.

Result: Generated a dataset of 1.7 million creative captions for the MSCOCO images, and demonstrated improved performance in zero-shot image-text retrieval in creative domains like poetry and metaphor visualization.

Conclusion: The method enhances creative captioning capabilities while maintaining visual grounding, benefiting tasks requiring abstraction in image-text associations. The resources have been shared for community use.

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores activation disparities in multilingual LLMs for medium-to-low resource languages and applies activation-aware fine-tuning to improve their performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medium to low resource languages tend to underperform in multilingual LLMs on standard benchmarks, raising concerns of cross-linguistic generalization disparities.

Method: The authors analyze activation patterns using Sparse Autoencoders and apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across residual layers in various languages.

Result: Activation-aware fine-tuning led to significant activation gains (e.g., 87.69% for Malayalam and 86.32% for Hindi) and modest yet consistent benchmark improvements.

Conclusion: Aligning activation patterns is crucial for improving multilingual LLM performance, especially for medium-to-low resource languages.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLaVA-NeuMT, a framework for multimodal multilingual translation, which tackles cross-lingual interference and improves translation efficiency while achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in extending multimodal machine translation (MMT) to multilingual scenarios, specifically tackling cross-lingual interference and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies.

Method: LLaVA-NeuMT comprises a layer selection mechanism for identifying informative layers and neuron-level adaptation for dynamically selecting language-specific and agnostic neurons, aiming to enhance translation quality while reducing redundancy.

Result: Extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and M3-AmbigCaps datasets show that LLaVA-NeuMT, tuning only 40% of model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently and effectively enhances multimodal multilingual adaptation by leveraging selective mechanisms for layers and neurons, presenting a scalable solution to cross-lingual interference in translation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

*Sang Min Jung,Kaixiang Zhang,Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated similarity measure to compare conversations based on their interactional dynamics, validating its robustness and utility through a framework and real-world application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing conversational quality requires understanding interactional patterns rather than isolated replies, and there is currently no robust method for comparing dynamics between conversations.

Method: The authors propose a novel similarity metric, validate its robustness through a designed testing framework, and examine its sensitivity to conversational topics.

Result: The metric is applied to a large online community's conversations, yielding insights into the impact of situational power on conversational dynamics.

Conclusion: The developed metric enhances conversational analysis and provides practical insights into interactional patterns, offering broader implications for evaluating conversational agents and understanding conversation dynamics.

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

*Bohan Yao,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG enhances LLMs by concurrently using multiple tools without finetuning, achieving significant advancements in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous tool-augmented LLMs struggle with solving complex multi-step math problems due to reliance on single-tool approaches.

Method: Multi-TAG guides LLMs to invoke multiple tools simultaneously at each reasoning step, aggregating their outputs to improve accuracy and robustness.

Result: Multi-TAG shows consistent and substantial performance gains, achieving 6.0% to 7.5% improvements across challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: This inference-only framework effectively elevates the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs, offering robustness and broad applicability without finetuning.

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Arg-LLaDA, a framework for improving argument summarization by iteratively refining summaries using a sufficiency-guided remasking approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing summarization methods for arguments rely on single-pass generation, lacking mechanisms for factual correction and structural refinement.

Method: Arg-LLaDA employs iterative improvement via a flexible masking controller paired with a sufficiency-checking module to refine unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that Arg-LLaDA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 metrics, with human assessments confirming improvements in coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness.

Conclusion: The iterative and sufficiency-aware approach of Arg-LLaDA offers enhanced faithfulness, conciseness, and coherence in argument summarization, addressing deficits of earlier techniques.

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DebateCV, a claim verification framework using multiple LLM agents in a debate-style methodology, outperforming existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-LLM approaches struggle with complex claim verification requiring multiple evidence facets, necessitating advanced methodologies.

Method: DebateCV uses a debate-driven framework where two LLM agents debate claims, with a Moderator evaluating and deciding outcomes. A post-training strategy bolsters Moderator performance with synthetic debate data.

Result: Experimental findings demonstrate that DebateCV surpasses existing methods in claim verification performance across various evidence quality levels.

Conclusion: DebateCV provides a robust solution for claim verification using multi-agent debate dynamics, contributing to improved digital literacy and fact-checking efficacy.

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEPA, a prompt optimizer leveraging natural language reflection to improve LLM task performance efficiently, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for adapting large language models require thousands of rollouts, which limits efficiency and scalability.

Method: GEPA reflects on system-level trajectories in natural language, diagnoses issues, proposes updates, tests prompts, and synthesizes improvements using Pareto-efficient approaches.

Result: GEPA achieves an average improvement of 10% over GRPO using up to 35x fewer rollouts and surpasses MIPROv2 by over 10% across two LLMs.

Conclusion: GEPA offers a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional RL-based learning methods for LLMs by leveraging natural language reflection and optimizing prompts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

TL;DR: This paper explores how users interpret topics generated by models, proposing a theory based on cognitive biases like anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic, and highlighting the need for user-aware evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how users interpret topics to improve task-grounded evaluation measures and move beyond existing measures like coherence that don't consider user exploration.

Method: Conducted user studies where users assessed topics, gave rationales, and applied reflexive thematic analysis to uncover interpretation themes.

Result: Users rely on availability and representativeness heuristics rather than probability; a theory of topic interpretation based on anchoring-and-adjustment was proposed.

Conclusion: To improve the evaluation of topic models, frameworks should account for cognitive biases and model users' ecological rationality in topic interpretation.

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

*Gioele Giachino,Marco Rondina,Antonio Vetrò,Riccardo Coppola,Juan Carlos De Martin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Google Gemini can generate gender-biased content in Italian through prompts, highlighting significant stereotype perpetuation in the professional domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the potential of LLMs to perpetuate gender and professional biases, particularly in non-English languages like Italian.

Method: The authors conducted structured experiments, prompting two LLM-based chatbots (ChatGPT and Google Gemini) with ungendered queries about hierarchical professional roles, analyzing 3600 responses for bias.

Result: Both models demonstrated significant bias, with Gemini associating 'assistant' roles 100% to 'she' pronouns, compared to 97% for ChatGPT. These findings reveal notable stereotyping in AI-generated content.

Conclusion: The study underscores the ethical risks and potential societal implications of biased LLM-generated outputs, emphasizing the need for mitigation strategies and further research in multilingual and algorithmic fairness.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

*Chaymaa Abbas,Mariette Awad,Razane Tajeddine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores how data poisoning disproportionately increases toxicity for African American Vernacular English (AAVE) over Standard American English (SAE) in outputs of large language models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to investigate how social biases in LLMs interact with dialectal variations, such as AAVE versus SAE, under the influence of data poisoning, highlighting concerns about inclusion and fairness.

Method: The authors used small- and medium-scale LLaMA models to evaluate the impact of minimal exposure to poisoned data on toxicity levels, employing GPT-4o as a fairness auditor to identify stereotypical patterns tied to AAVE.

Result: The study found that minor exposure to poisoned data significantly increases toxicity in AAVE inputs, whereas SAE inputs are less affected. Larger LLMs amplify this disparity. GPT-4o confirmed harmful stereotypes disproportionately linked to AAVE.

Conclusion: The research emphasizes the compounded effects of data poisoning and dialectal bias in LLMs, highlighting the urgent need for dialect-aware evaluations, debiasing strategies, and responsible training protocols to mitigate biases.

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

*Zi Liang,Liantong Yu,Shiyu Zhang,Qingqing Ye,Haibo Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) and proposes a dynamic evaluation framework named ArxivRoll to ensure fairer and more reliable benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to counter the overestimation in LLM evaluations caused by public benchmark contamination and training biases, which lead to unreliable capability assessments and unfair comparisons.

Method: The authors propose ArxivRoll, a framework with two components: SCP (an automated tool to generate private test cases) and Rugged Scores (to measure contamination and biases). ArxivRoll periodically generates new benchmarks from recent ArXiv articles and employs them for one-time evaluations.

Result: The authors validate the quality of their benchmark through extensive experiments and provide a systematic evaluation of LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of ArxivRoll.

Conclusion: ArxivRoll ensures reproducibility, transparency, and efficiency in evaluating LLMs by addressing public benchmark contamination and imbalanced training. It is a valuable advancement for reliable LLM performance assessments.

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

### [44] [Jailbreaking Large Language Diffusion Models: Revealing Hidden Safety Flaws in Diffusion-Based Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19227)
*Yuanhe Zhang,Fangzhou Xie,Zhenhong Zhou,Zherui Li,Hao Chen,Kun Wang,Yufei Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the safety vulnerabilities of Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs), introduces a novel PAD jailbreak attack method to expose these weaknesses, and highlights their risks compared to traditional LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the safety robustness of LLDMs, as current security measures fail to address their unique architectural features, leaving concerns about harmful generations unresolved.

Method: The researchers designed the PArallel Decoding (PAD) jailbreak attack with a Multi-Point Attention Attack mechanism to guide LLDMs toward harmful outputs, capitalizing on their architectural features.

Result: PAD achieved a 97% success rate in jailbreak attacks across four LLDMs, demonstrating their significant safety vulnerabilities. LLDMs also generated harmful content at twice the speed of comparable LLMs.

Conclusion: LLDMs pose serious safety risks and vulnerabilities, and their secure deployment requires new methods tailored to their architecture. The findings emphasize the critical need for improved security measures in diffusion-based language models.

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

### [45] [Identifying Fine-grained Forms of Populism in Political Discourse: A Case Study on Donald Trump's Presidential Campaigns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19303)
*Ilias Chalkidis,Stephanie Brandl,Paris Aslanidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify nuanced populist discourse, introduces tailored datasets, compares model performance, and analyzes cross-context transferability in political speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to explore LLMs' potential in understanding complex social science concepts like populism, which remains underutilized despite the growing capabilities of these models.

Method: The authors curate specific datasets on populist rhetoric, test various LLMs using diverse prompting paradigms, and compare them to fine-tuned models like RoBERTa. Additionally, they analyze real-world political speeches for practical insights and assess the generalizability of models in cross-context settings.

Result: The study reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs have limitations in detecting and classifying nuanced populist discourse, with fine-tuned models like RoBERTa performing significantly better. However, instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate robustness on out-of-domain data.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned LLMs have room for improvement in social science tasks without domain-specific fine-tuning, and better-performing models like RoBERTa can enhance analysis. Insights into political strategy and cross-context transferability were successfully extracted.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

### [46] [AutoPCR: Automated Phenotype Concept Recognition by Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19315)
*Yicheng Tao,Yuanhao Huang,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoPCR is a prompt-based method for phenotype concept recognition that avoids ontology-specific training, ensuring robust and generalized performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to phenotype concept recognition often face limitations in generalizing across diverse text types and evolving terminology, necessitating a more flexible solution.

Method: AutoPCR uses three stages: entity extraction (rule-based and neural tagging), candidate retrieval (via SapBERT), and entity linking (using a large language model prompting).

Result: AutoPCR achieved the best average performance on four benchmark datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: AutoPCR demonstrates superior generalizability and inductive capabilities without the need for ontology-specific training, addressing challenges in the biomedical text mining domain.

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

### [47] [Smooth Reading: Bridging the Gap of Recurrent LLM to Self-Attention LLM on Long-Context Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19353)
*Kai Liu,Zhan Su,Peijie Dong,Fengran Mo,Jianfei Gao,ShaoTing Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Smooth Reading' for Recurrent LLMs, enabling comparable long-context performance to Self-Attention LLMs while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recurrent LLMs are efficient alternatives to Self-Attention LLMs but struggle on long-context tasks due to fixed-size memory limitations.

Method: The proposed Smooth Reading processes context chunk-wise, iteratively summarizing information to align better with Recurrent LLM structure.

Result: Experimental results show Smooth Reading significantly improves Recurrent LLM performance on long-context tasks and enhances speed compared to Self-Attention LLMs.

Conclusion: Smooth Reading bridges the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention LLMs for long-context tasks while retaining computational advantages and inspires further research.

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

### [48] [Enhancing Speech Emotion Recognition Leveraging Aligning Timestamps of ASR Transcripts and Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19356)
*Hsuan-Yu Wang,Pei-Ying Lee,Berlin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper improves Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy by aligning timestamps between ASR and Speaker Diarization outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment in ASR transcripts and speaker diarization data negatively impacts multimodal emotion recognition, especially in conversations.

Method: The paper introduces a pipeline with pre-trained ASR and SD models to align timestamps, combining RoBERTa-based textual embeddings and Wav2Vec audio embeddings using cross-attention with a gating mechanism.

Result: The proposed method improves SER accuracy on the IEMOCAP dataset, surpassing unsynchronized baseline methods.

Conclusion: Precise timestamp alignment enhances multimodal emotion recognition and establishes a robust framework for analyzing conversational emotions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

### [49] [SpeechIQ: Speech Intelligence Quotient Across Cognitive Levels in Voice Understanding Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19361)
*Zhen Wan,Chao-Han Huck Yang,Yahan Yu,Jinchuan Tian,Sheng Li,Ke Hu,Zhehuai Chen,Shinji Watanabe,Fei Cheng,Chenhui Chu,Sadao Kurohashi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes SIQ, a new evaluation framework for assessing voice understanding in large language models, incorporating cognitive principles based on Bloom's Taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voice understanding metrics, such as word error rate, lack depth in evaluating the voice comprehension capabilities of large language models.

Method: The framework uses three levels of cognitive assessment inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy: Remembering (WER), Understanding (interpretation similarity), and Application (QA accuracy in downstream tasks).

Result: SIQ enables comparisons between cascaded and end-to-end models, identifies faults in existing evaluations and benchmarks, and highlights hallucination issues in LLM Voice.

Conclusion: SIQ bridges cognitive principles with voice benchmarks, enhancing voice understanding evaluation and exposing key challenges in multi-modal training.

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation
errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our
framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges
cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked
challenges in multi-modal training.

*Penny Karanasou,Mengjie Qian,Stefano Bannò,Mark J. F. Gales,Kate M. Knill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method for generating audio-text pairs with grammatical errors, alongside metrics to evaluate the data, specifically for Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of high-quality annotated spoken datasets for SGEC.

Method: Develop a fully automated method to create grammatically erroneous audio-text pairs, maintaining original corpus characteristics.

Result: Generated augmented dataset preserves language scores of L2 learners, enhancing both written GEC and SGEC.

Conclusion: The augmented dataset successfully enriches corpora for SGEC evaluations and aids in correcting grammatical errors in speech.

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study benchmarks adverse drug event (ADE) detection in Dutch clinical free-text using transformer models and sets performance baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and benchmark effective methods for ADE detection in Dutch clinical free-text documents in the ICU and medical settings.

Method: Trained and evaluated Bi-LSTM and four transformer-based models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) on named entity recognition and relation classification using annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes.

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl outperformed the others, achieving the best results in internal testing (macro-F1 0.63) and external validation (recall 0.67-0.74 for discharge letters with ADEs).

Conclusion: The study establishes MedRoBERTa.nl as the most effective model for ADE detection, emphasizing the importance of task-specific performance measures and future clinical applications.

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEDTE, a medical text embedding model fine-tuned on diverse data, and proposes a benchmark suite of 51 tasks to address limitations in existing medical embeddings and evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical text embedding models lack diversity in training data and suffer from outdated methodologies and inadequate evaluations.

Method: The authors developed MEDTE using extensive self-supervised contrastive learning from diverse medical corpora and proposed a benchmark suite spanning 51 tasks modeled on MTEB.

Result: The MEDTE model outperformed state-of-the-art alternatives across various tasks and established a robust evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The proposed solutions enhance medical text embeddings and provide a comprehensive evaluation framework for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

*Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan,Parth Ganeriwala,Sarah M. Lehman,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Amy Alvarez,Natasha Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lane detection models risk catastrophic forgetting during cross-dataset fine-tuning. They propose a method using separate branches for different datasets and inferencing through input distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address catastrophic forgetting in lane detection tasks during cross-dataset fine-tuning, exacerbated by distribution shifts between datasets.

Method: The approach involves training a base model, creating dataset-specific branches for adaptation, using component-specific fine-tuning strategies, and employing a supervised contrastive learning model for distribution-aware dynamic routing during inference.

Result: The proposed framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while significantly reducing parameter usage compared to training separate models for each dataset.

Conclusion: Their strategy offers a parameter-efficient adaptation method for cross-dataset lane detection, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and achieving performance comparable to independent models for each dataset.

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

*Fabio De Sousa Ribeiro,Omar Todd,Charles Jones,Avinash Kori,Raghav Mehta,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study introduces Flow-SSN, a generative segmentation model that overcomes limitations in prior methods and offers efficiency and state-of-the-art results in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in segmentation models, such as low-rank parameterization and inefficiency in sampling, and to enhance performance in medical imaging tasks.

Method: The paper introduces Flow-SSNs that use a discrete-time autoregressive and continuous-time flow approach, which eliminates low-rank assumptions and allocates model capacity to learning expressive priors.

Result: Flow-SSNs achieve state-of-the-art results in medical imaging benchmarks and enable efficient sampling through their optimized model structure.

Conclusion: Flow-SSNs advance segmentation model capabilities by addressing foundational limitations, improving sampling efficiency, and enhancing performance in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a
generative segmentation model family featuring discrete-time autoregressive and
modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

### [60] [Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18655)
*James Dickens,Kamyar Hamad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes using raw geometry, leveraging advancements in point cloud learning and introducing a pseudo-ground truth pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge point cloud learning and human parsing domains by enabling semantic segmentation of human meshes.

Method: The method involves a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline with canonical pose alignment and multi-viewpoint segmentation, combined with a novel windowed iterative FPS sampling and PointTransformer-based geometric segmentation.

Result: The approach proves memory-efficient and achieves accurate semantic segmentation results.

Conclusion: A novel, effective method for semantic segmentation of human meshes without texture reliance is introduced, showcasing robust results.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

### [61] [A New One-Shot Federated Learning Framework for Medical Imaging Classification with Feature-Guided Rectified Flow and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19045)
*Yufei Ma,Hanwen Zhang,Qiya Yang,Guibo Luo,Yuesheng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) framework to improve efficiency, privacy, and performance in non-IID medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OSFL methods face challenges like inefficiency, privacy risks, and difficulty in converging under non-IID data, especially in healthcare applications.

Method: The proposed framework introduces a Feature-Guided Rectified Flow Model (FG-RF) for privacy-preserving generative modeling and a Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) method for improving global model aggregation.

Result: Experiments on three non-IID medical imaging datasets show the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement and reduced privacy leakage with feature-level synthetic images.

Conclusion: The authors demonstrate that their method is more efficient, preserves privacy better, and is more robust for non-IID data in medical imaging OSFL scenarios compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

### [62] [ShrinkBox: Backdoor Attack on Object Detection to Disrupt Collision Avoidance in Machine Learning-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18656)
*Muhammad Zaeem Shahzad,Muhammad Abdullah Hanif,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ShrinkBox, a backdoor attack against collision avoidance ML-ADAS, which subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes in object detection, compromising distance estimation and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing security vulnerabilities in ML-based collision avoidance systems in ADAS, especially targeting cost-effective, camera-based implementations relying on DNNs.

Method: Develop and test ShrinkBox, a backdoor attack that manipulates object bounding boxes in datasets, leading to errors in downstream distance estimations. Experimentation is conducted on YOLOv9m and the KITTI dataset.

Result: The ShrinkBox attack achieved a 96% Attack Success Rate (ASR) at a low poisoning ratio of 4%, and caused a >3x increase in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in distance estimation.

Conclusion: ShrinkBox demonstrates a serious security threat to lightweight ML-ADAS systems by executing targeted attacks that degrade collision avoidance performance, highlighting the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

*Zehui Zhao,Laith Alzubaidi,Haider A. Alwzwazy,Jinglan Zhang,Yuantong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGS-ATD, a new distributed learning framework for medical imaging, addressing privacy, scalability, and efficiency issues found in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized and decentralized learning methods face challenges such as privacy risks, inefficiencies, and scalability issues, especially in dynamic clinical environments.

Method: The authors propose VGS-ATD, a distributed learning framework tested across 30 datasets and 80 labels, offering continuous learning, reduced communication inefficiencies, and resilience to catastrophic forgetting.

Result: VGS-ATD achieved 92.7% accuracy, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and swarm learning (72.99%). It showed resilience to catastrophic forgetting, with minimal accuracy drop after system expansion, and reduced computational costs by up to 50%.

Conclusion: VGS-ATD improves privacy, efficiency, scalability, and system resilience in distributed medical imaging learning compared to traditional centralized and decentralized methods.

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

### [65] [Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18661)
*Ruixing Zhang,Yang Zhang,Tongyu Zhu,Leilei Sun,Weifeng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for next-location prediction tasks by incorporating road network and trajectory visual reasoning akin to human-like methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps in a human-like manner, and the authors aim to leverage advancements in Vision-Language Models to enable trajectory-based reasoning similar to how humans predict locations.

Method: The authors present two methods: (1) Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS) to test VLMs on trajectory reasoning without parameter changes, and (2) VLMLocPredictor, which combines supervised fine-tuning for understanding map structures and reinforcement learning to improve predictive capabilities.

Result: Their VLMLocPredictor model outperformed existing methods across datasets from four cities, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating superior cross-city generalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating visual reasoning through VLMs presents significant improvements in next-location prediction tasks, suggesting that human-like reasoning methods can enhance performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

*Nicholas Fidalgo,Aaron Contreras,Katherine Harvey,Johnny Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores AI-driven methods for automated suspect sketching, comparing three models, with Model 1 showing the best overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance and automate suspect sketching using multimodal AI techniques for better reliability and accuracy.

Method: Three approaches were developed: (1) basic Stable Diffusion image-to-image model, (2) integration of pre-trained CLIP for text-image alignment, and (3) a novel LoRA fine-tuned Stable Diffusion system targeting self- and cross-attention layers.

Result: Model 1 outperformed others, achieving the best SSIM (0.72) and PSNR (25 dB). Ablation studies confirmed improvements in text-sketch alignment by fine-tuning both attention layers, but it fell short compared to Model 1 in structural and perceptual similarity.

Conclusion: Despite its simplicity, Model 1 proved the most effective, demonstrating robustness in generating clear facial features for suspect sketching.

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

*Sanyam Jain,Marsha Mariya Kappan,Vijeta Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the performance of the CLIP model for human action recognition on the UCF-101 dataset, analyzes its weaknesses under different masking strategies, and proposes an enhancement to improve accuracy and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of traditional models like CNNs and RNNs in generalizing human action recognition across diverse and complex actions, particularly in healthcare applications.

Method: CLIP's performance was evaluated under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking, (2) feature-specific masking, and (3) isolation masking. The authors further proposed adding class-specific noise learned via a custom loss function to enhance the model.

Result: The analysis revealed that CLIP often exhibits inconsistent behavior and misclassifications when key visual cues are masked. The proposed enhancement improved classification accuracy, model confidence, and reduced bias.

Conclusion: The enhanced approach demonstrated improved performance, but the paper highlights challenges in deploying such models in clinical scenarios and emphasizes the need for further work to achieve domain-independent generalizability in healthcare.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

*Siyu Mu,Wei Xuan Chan,Choon Hwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet, a deep learning framework, predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) geometry from clinical images with high accuracy and significantly faster computation compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting unloaded heart geometry is crucial for understanding cardiac physiology and supporting personalized clinical modeling, but current methods using inverse finite element solvers are computationally intensive.

Method: HeartUnloadNet uses a graph attention architecture with biophysical priors and cycle-consistency for bidirectional prediction, allowing partial self-supervision to improve accuracy and reduce training dataset requirements.

Result: The model achieves sub-millimeter accuracy (DSC 0.986 and HD 0.083 cm) and reduces inference time to 0.02 seconds, outperforming traditional finite element methods in speed and reliability.

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet offers a fast and accurate solution for predicting unloaded LV geometry, enabling scalable real-time clinical applications, even with limited training samples.

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Motivation: The scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets limits advancements in spatial intelligence, a key component in AI research. While 2D imagery is plentiful, acquiring annotated 3D data is costly and complex.

Method: The proposed pipeline converts single-view images into rich 3D data by performing depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale calibration. This approach generates realistic point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and pseudo-RGBD representations.

Result: The authors created two extensive datasets (COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D) using their pipeline and proved its utility via experiments across various 3D tasks, including perception and multimodal large language model-based reasoning.

Conclusion: Their pipeline reduces 3D data collection costs and bridges the gap between 2D imagery and spatial intelligence demand, enabling advancements in AI systems for environmental interaction.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a new volumetric representation for efficient and scalable light-based sensor simulation, addressing limitations of current methods like NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating light-based sensors accurately and efficiently is crucial for autonomy testing, but existing methods are slow and lack interoperability across multiple sensors.

Method: The authors propose a sparse volumetric representation, SaLF, combining 3D voxel primitives and local implicit fields, enabling both rasterization and raytracing.

Result: SaLF demonstrates fast training (<30 minutes), high rendering speeds (50+ FPS for cameras and 600+ FPS for LiDAR), adaptive scalability, and compatibility with various sensors.

Conclusion: SaLF enhances realism, efficiency, and versatility in sensor simulation, paving the way for more scalable and robust autonomy testing.

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many historical Chinese musical notations lack digitization due to class imbalance in data and limited training resources, making them inaccessible. Advancing OMR can address this gap.

Method: A character recognition model was developed, employing advanced calibration techniques and cross-validation methods for imbalanced and scarce datasets. It also extended the KuiSCIMA dataset.

Result: Improved CER metrics from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu and achieved 0.9% CER for lülüpu, surpassing human transcription accuracy and ensuring robust cross-edition performance.

Conclusion: The advancements enable accurate transcription of Chinese musical notations, enhancing cultural preservation and broadening the scope of OMR to include underrepresented traditions.

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets, hindering the semantic understanding of SAR imagery which is essential for remote sensing.

Method: The authors created the SAR-Text dataset using a multi-stage progressive transfer learning framework called SAR-Narrator. Experiments on three vision-language tasks (image-text retrieval, captioning, and VQA) were conducted with three customized models: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT.

Result: The models showcased significant improvements across tasks. SAR-RS-CLIP enhanced retrieval performance, SAR-RS-CoCa achieved drastically better scores in captioning tasks, and SAR-GPT demonstrated superior reasoning and semantic understanding in VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The SAR-Text dataset significantly enhances SAR imagery understanding, and the SAR-Narrator framework offers flexibility to construct larger datasets, benefiting the vision-language community.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

### [73] [Diffusion-FS: Multimodal Free-Space Prediction via Diffusion for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18763)
*Keshav Gupta,Tejas S. Stanley,Pranjal Paul,Arun K. Singh,K. Madhava Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ContourDiff, a method for drivable free-space corridor prediction using only monocular camera input. It employs a self-supervised approach and relies on future ego trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles currently struggle to estimate navigable driving corridors within road regions effectively, due to limitations in existing BEV-centric representation methods.

Method: The paper develops a self-supervised method utilizing future ego trajectories and front-view camera images. ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture, models corridor prediction using contour points instead of binary masks.

Result: The proposed approach achieved successful multimodal corridor predictions on datasets like nuScenes and CARLA.

Conclusion: ContourDiff provides a structured and interpretable framework for predicting safe driving corridors, offering improvements over traditional free-space prediction methods in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

### [74] [Learning Efficient and Generalizable Human Representation with Human Gaussian Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18758)
*Yifan Liu,Shengjun Zhang,Chensheng Dai,Yang Chen,Hao Liu,Chen Li,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces "Human Gaussian Graph," a new method for creating animatable 3D human avatars from videos by leveraging inter-frame relations using graph-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for animatable human avatars either rely on time-consuming per-instance optimization or treat each video frame independently, failing to leverage inter-frame relations effectively.

Method: The authors propose a dual-layer Human Gaussian Graph. The first layer consists of predicted Gaussians, while the second layer consists of human SMPL mesh vertices. Intra-node operations aggregate Gaussians for mesh vertices, and inter-node operations enable message passing among neighboring mesh nodes.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates enhanced efficiency and generalization capability in tasks like novel view synthesis and novel pose animation.

Conclusion: By leveraging the relationships between Gaussians and human mesh vertices across video frames, the method offers an efficient and generalized approach to modeling animatable human avatars.

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

### [75] [Perspective from a Higher Dimension: Can 3D Geometric Priors Help Visual Floorplan Localization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18881)
*Bolei Chen,Jiaxu Kang,Haonan Yang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper enhances 2D floorplan localization by integrating 3D geometric priors using self-supervised contrastive learning, bridging the modal gap for improved localization results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floorplans' robust and stable characteristics make them valuable for self-localization, but challenges arise due to differences in 2D visuals and 3D obstructions.

Method: The authors introduce self-supervised 3D geometric priors, like multi-view constraints and view-scene alignment, into a visual floorplan localization algorithm.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in localization accuracy and requires no extra geometric or semantic annotations.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D geometric priors resolves modal gaps and boosts floorplan localization accuracy without added computational demand. Data and code will be shared post-review.

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

*Hitesh Kumar Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops and systematically analyzes foundational image captioning models, culminating in a competitive attention-based system called Nexus, achieving strong performance on the MS COCO dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand foundational architectural principles in image captioning by iteratively enhancing models from simple to advanced designs, and addressing limitations in prior typical CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder approaches.

Method: The authors present five progressively developed models, emphasizing an iterative progression. They analyze the effect of enhanced visual backbones and propose a dynamic attention mechanism, culminating in the Nexus model with an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone.

Result: The final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several foundational benchmarks, highlighting the efficacy of architectural enhancements like attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study validates the importance of attention mechanisms in image captioning models and offers a replicable framework for foundational model development in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

### [77] [Deepfake Detection Via Facial Feature Extraction and Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18815)
*Benjamin Carter,Nathan Dilla,Micheal Callahan,Atuhaire Ambala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using facial landmarks instead of raw image processing to detect deepfakes, achieving high accuracy across different neural network models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake technology is becoming harder to detect due to its increasing sophistication, raising concerns about media authenticity.

Method: Facial landmark extraction is used to identify subtle inconsistencies in facial movements, which are then applied to various neural network models. The models tested include RNN, ANN, and CNN.

Result: RNN and ANN models achieved high accuracy rates of 96% and 93%, respectively, while the CNN model performed at a lower 78% accuracy.

Conclusion: Facial landmark-focused deepfake detection is a viable alternative to raw-image processing, offering fewer parameters and compatibility across various neural network models.

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

*Melih Yazgan,Allen Xavier Arasan,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EffiComm improves collaborative vehicle perception by reducing transmitted data by 60%, while maintaining high 3D object detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in collaborative perception face challenges transmitting raw sensor data due to latency and scalability issues over V2V networks.

Method: EffiComm uses Selective Transmission to prune data and Adaptive Grid Reduction with a Graph Neural Network to optimize data reduction based on role and load. Features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts attention.

Result: EffiComm achieves 0.84 mAP@0.7 on the OPV2V benchmark, transmitting only 1.5 MB per frame, surpassing prior methods in accuracy-per-bit efficiency.

Conclusion: EffiComm provides an effective, scalable framework for Vehicle-to-Everything perception by leveraging adaptive and learned communication methods.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

*Pol Francesch Huc,Emily Bates,Simone D'Amico*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a CNN-based initializer for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable efficient 3D model learning from monocular images under noisy or implicit pose estimates, significantly reducing training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of needing accurate pose data and high computational costs in novel view synthesis methods like NeRF and 3DGS for space applications.

Method: Proposes a CNN that generates a coarse 3D model and pose estimates from a single image to initialize 3DGS. The pipeline incorporates methods to handle noisy or implicit pose data and explores initialization variants.

Result: The proposed approach reduces training iterations and required input images by at least an order of magnitude. It achieves accurate 3D representations even under imperfect pose supervision.

Conclusion: The method enables more efficient 3D learning while maintaining precision, making it suitable for space applications and extending the usability of novel view synthesis techniques.

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTCMIL is an advanced MIL method addressing heterogeneity in WSIs by integrating learnable prompt tokens in a ViT backbone for efficient clustering and prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods struggle with the complexity and variability of WSIs, and current solutions like ViTs are computationally costly and lack flexibility to account for task-specific variations.

Method: PTCMIL introduces learnable prompt tokens integrated within a ViT backbone, combining projection-based clustering and prototype-based pooling for task-specific analysis.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets show PTCMIL excels in classification and survival analysis, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, with strong robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: PTCMIL offers an efficient, interpretable, and robust solution to WSI analysis, demonstrating significant improvements over existing MIL approaches.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate self-localization is vital in robot soccer, necessitating efficient field feature detection for reliable pose estimation.

Method: The ELSED algorithm is extended with RGB color transition classification, and detection is calibrated using Particle Swarm Optimization, requiring minimal annotated data.

Result: The method delivers accuracy on par with deep learning models but achieves faster processing speeds, suitable for low-power real-time robotics.

Conclusion: The approach is practical for robotic platforms where speed and efficiency are crucial, balancing accuracy with computational demands.

Abstract: Self-localization is essential in robot soccer, where accurate detection of
visual field features, such as lines and boundaries, is critical for reliable
pose estimation. This paper presents a lightweight and efficient method for
detecting soccer field lines using the ELSED algorithm, extended with a
classification step that analyzes RGB color transitions to identify lines
belonging to the field. We introduce a pipeline based on Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) for threshold calibration to optimize detection performance,
requiring only a small number of annotated samples. Our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to a state-of-the-art deep learning model while offering
higher processing speed, making it well-suited for real-time applications on

*Matthew Kit Khinn Teng,Haibo Zhang,Takeshi Saitoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-stage phoneme-based framework for Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) using visual and facial landmark motion features, which improves word error rate (WER) compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is difficult due to the lack of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes with similar lip motions, leading to high error rates and the need for extensive training data in existing methods.

Method: The authors propose a phoneme-based two-stage framework. Stage 1 predicts phonemes using visual and landmark motion features, thereby reducing training complexity and addressing speaker-specific variations. Stage 2 uses an encoder-decoder LLM model (NLLB) to reconstruct words from these phonemes.

Result: The proposed PV-ASR approach achieves a WER of 17.4% on the LRS2 dataset and 21.0% on the LRS3 dataset, showing superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By adopting a phoneme-based multi-stage approach and leveraging facial landmark features, the PV-ASR method minimizes error rates and visual ambiguity challenges in V-ASR, providing a promising advancement in the field.

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MAT-Adv, a robust adversarial attack framework on 3D point clouds, improving transferability and undefendability by perturbing medial axis transform representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transferability and robustness in existing adversarial attack methods for 3D deep learning models.

Method: The framework uses an autoencoder to transform point clouds into medial axis transform representations, which are then strategically perturbed. A dropout strategy is employed to reduce overfitting and perturbation collapse.

Result: MAT-Adv achieves superior transferability and undefendability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAT-Adv enhances adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds by targeting intrinsic geometric structures, making it more effective against diverse models and defenses.

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Zhihao Luo,Luojun Lin,Zheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework to improve model performance for camouflaged object detection by using synthetic datasets and unannotated real images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited datasets, especially for specialized categories in camouflaged object detection, and the performance gap when using synthetic data.

Method: Proposed a Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA) based on a student-teacher model that combines pseudo labeling and consistency regularization along with recurrent learning.

Result: The CSRDA framework showed improved model performance, mitigating data and annotation limitations in the COD task.

Conclusion: The proposed CSRDA method enhances camouflaged object detection in real-world scenarios using synthetic and unannotated real image data.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HQ-SMem, a novel Video Object Segmentation (VOS) method addressing limitations like tracking drift, coarse masks, and memory inefficiency for long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOS models face challenges such as imprecise masks, deformable and topologically changing objects, and inefficiencies in long video processing.

Method: HQ-SMem incorporates: (i) refinement of segmentation masks using SAM-HQ and appearance-based candidate selection, (ii) a dynamic smart memory mechanism to optimize keyframe storage and efficiency, and (iii) dynamic appearance model updates to better manage object variations and reduce drift.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently ranking among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 benchmarks, and sets new records on Long Video Dataset and LVOS for handling complex multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: HQ-SMem effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional VOS models, establishing itself as a robust solution for video segmentation and tracking in complex, long-duration settings.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

Motivation: The motivation stems from inadequacies in prior methods like 3DGS and PGSR, which fail to optimize Gaussian placement and alignment, leading to uneven distributions and poor reconstruction refinement.

Method: GSSR utilizes fine-grained geometric alignment via single-view normal consistency, multi-view photometric consistency, opacity regularization loss, and Gaussian reinitialization for better spatial Gaussian distribution.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate GSSR's ability to achieve significantly better geometric precision in Gaussian placement, enabling intuitive scene editing and high-quality rendering.

Conclusion: GSSR advances Gaussian-based 3D reconstruction by introducing optimized geometric alignment and distribution techniques, creating realistic and editable 3D environments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

*Heitor R. Medeiros,Atif Belal,Masih Aminbeidokhti,Eric Granger,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study addresses the challenges in infrared object detection due to the scarcity of IR datasets and modality gap between RGB and IR. It introduces benchmarks for out-of-distribution evaluations and proposes weight-space ensembling methods to enhance robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large-scale infrared datasets and reliance on RGB pre-training leads to robustness challenges under distribution shifts in IR object detection.

Method: The paper introduces cross-modality benchmarks (LLVIP-C and FLIR-C) for robustness evaluation and proposes WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method, with two variants: zero-shot combining (WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$) and linear probing (WiSE-OD$_{LP}$).

Result: WiSE-OD demonstrates improved robustness across modality and corruption scenarios without requiring extra training or inference costs.

Conclusion: WiSE-OD is an effective and resource-efficient solution to enhance cross-modality and corruption robustness in IR object detection.

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

*Jian Chen,Yuxuan Hu,Haifeng Lu,Wei Wang,Min Yang,Chengming Li,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MGHFT, a hierarchical fusion transformer leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models to enhance sticker emotion recognition by effectively integrating textual and visual modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sticker emotions are inherently complex due to multi-view factors like stylistic elements and background context, presenting challenges for standard visual models.

Method: MGHFT utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models to derive contextual descriptions. Then, it employs pyramid visual transformers and textual features through hierarchical fusion strategies with attention mechanisms for enhanced multimodal integration.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate an improvement of 5.4% in F1 score and 4.0% in accuracy compared to the best pre-trained visual models.

Conclusion: MGHFT offers a significant advancement in sticker emotion recognition, proving the efficacy of integrating hierarchical text-guided fusion strategies with visual feature extraction.

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDT introduces a novel diffusion model framework to transform unstructured point cloud distributions into structured and semantically meaningful point distributions for 3D geometry processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limited exploration of how to effectively transform unstructured point cloud distributions into semantically meaningful structures for 3D processing tasks.

Method: The method uses diffusion models with a novel architecture and learning strategy to transform input point clouds into structured outputs through a denoising process that correlates the initial and target distributions.

Result: PDT produces diverse structured outputs, such as surface-aligned keypoints, inner sparse joints, and continuous feature lines, demonstrating its capacity to capture geometric and semantic features.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust tool for 3D geometry tasks, effectively converting unstructured point distributions into structured, semantically meaningful forms, with code to be publicly available.

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

TL;DR: The paper introduces OASIS, a novel technique for semi-supervised video object segmentation addressing occlusion and feature similarity issues via improved boundary and structure refinement. It delivers competitive accuracy and real-time processing speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in occlusion and feature similarity during video object segmentation, while maintaining real-time processing speeds for applications.

Method: The method introduces OASIS with a lightweight structure refinement module using edge priors from Canny filters and object features for enhanced boundary features. It also includes uncertainty estimation through evidential learning.

Result: OASIS achieves superior performance with F values of 91.6 and G values of 86.6 on benchmarks like DAVIS-17 and YouTubeVOS, respectively, maintaining a competitive inference speed of 48 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed OASIS method efficiently addresses occlusion-related challenges and enhances segmentation accuracy, making it suitable for downstream real-time applications.

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6
(vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive
speed of 48 FPS on DAVIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets for apical periodontitis diagnosis, hindering the development of CAD systems in dentistry.

Method: The paper releases the PerioXrays dataset and introduces the PerioDet model incorporating Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms.

Result: Experiments show PerioDet outperforms existing methods for apical periodontitis detection using the PerioXrays dataset and supports clinical collaboration with human experts.

Conclusion: The work establishes a benchmark dataset and an effective diagnostic tool for apical periodontitis, enhancing automated detection and clinical applicability.

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing vehicle attribute identification accuracy for law enforcement and intelligence applications.

Method: Three YOLO-based models (YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, YOLO-Classification) were tested on large real-world datasets, using multi-view inference and varying model sizes.

Result: The models achieved classification accuracies of 93.70% for make, 82.86% for shape, 85.19% for colour, and 94.86% for colour-binary predictions.

Conclusion: YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World are superior for make and shape extraction, smaller models offer efficiency, and multi-view inference is key for handling complex datasets.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study compares five object recognition models for underwater waste detection and finds YOLOv8 the most effective with an mAP of 80.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater pollution poses severe environmental challenges, requiring accurate detection methods for effective cleanup and monitoring.

Method: Five object recognition algorithms (YOLOv7 to YOLOv10 and Faster R-CNN) were tested on a dataset of fifteen classes under diverse underwater conditions.

Result: YOLOv8 had the highest performance (mAP of 80.9%) due to its advanced features like anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning.

Conclusion: YOLOv8 is recommended as a robust solution for enhancing underwater waste detection and aiding global pollution mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective
tool in the global fight against pollution, improving both the detection

*Chao Wang,Kejiang Chen,Zijin Yang,Yaofei Wang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction) is a novel approach designed to improve attribution accuracy for generative models by using innovative double-reconstruction techniques, addressing issues of computational cost and reduced accuracy associated with prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns over the security risks of photorealistic image-generation technologies necessitate reliable methods to trace image origins.

Method: AEDR integrates double reconstructions through autoencoders and employs reconstruction loss ratios, further calibrated by an image homogeneity metric, to enhance attribution accuracy.

Result: AEDR exhibits 25.5% higher attribution accuracy compared to previous methods and operates at just 1% of their computational costs.

Conclusion: AEDR is a training-free, efficient, and accurate attribution method that addresses the challenges posed by state-of-the-art generative models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel prompting-based method to improve point cloud analysis under noise and incompleteness, overcoming limitations of isolated and conflicting approaches for denoising and completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud analysis suffers from low-quality data caused by noise and incompleteness in real-world scenarios, and existing methods with isolated enhancement models fail to perform robustly across domains.

Method: The authors propose a unified prompting mechanism with a Rectification Prompter for noise filtering, a Completion Prompter for generating auxiliary prompts, and a Shape-Aware Unit to unify geometric features efficiently.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance and robustness on noisy and incomplete point cloud data through extensive experiments on four datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The unified prompting framework efficiently addresses the challenges of point cloud analysis in noisy and incomplete data, advancing robustness and effectiveness in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GR-CLIP, a calibration method to address the modality gap in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP, enabling superior performance in mixed modality search scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of existing vision-language models, like CLIP, which struggle in mixed modality search due to distinct clustering of image and text embeddings.

Method: The authors propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight post-hoc calibration method that harmonizes the embedding space of CLIP by removing the modality gap.

Result: On the MixBench benchmark for mixed modality search, GR-CLIP achieves significant improvements: up to 26-point increase in NDCG@10 compared to CLIP and surpasses recent models with far less computational cost.

Conclusion: GR-CLIP addresses core challenges in mixed modality search, providing a computationally efficient solution that enhances performance over current models.

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents GPSMamba, a novel framework for improving infrared image super-resolution by integrating non-causal modeling and architectural innovations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared image super-resolution is challenging due to low contrast and sparse textures in infrared data, requiring effective long-range modeling for global coherence. Existing models like Mamba face limitations in capturing global context due to their 1D causal mechanism.

Method: The paper introduces GPSMamba with two main innovations: the Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) for semantic-frequency prompt integration and the Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss for non-causal global supervision.

Result: GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in infrared image super-resolution, evidenced by extensive experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed GPSMamba framework effectively overcomes limitations in causal modeling, achieving superior infrared image restoration and providing a new paradigm in this domain.

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in existing evaluation frameworks for text-to-image models and proposes a novel ICT score and HP score model to improve scoring accuracy and optimize image aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between current evaluation frameworks and human aesthetic preferences in contemporary text-to-image generation systems.

Method: Developed the ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score for text-image representation evaluation and the HP (High-Preference) score model tailored to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality.

Result: The proposed model improves scoring accuracy by over 10% compared to existing evaluation methods and optimizes state-of-the-art text-to-image models.

Conclusion: The research advances evaluation methodologies, aligning them with human aesthetics and promoting higher-quality image generation systems.

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA,
the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle
variability in image dimensions, modalities, anatomical regions, and types. We
developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually
annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice
assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval
and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical
parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA

Conclusion: Current evaluation benchmarks and detection methods for hallucination in MLLMs require improvement to reliably identify and mitigate hallucinated content, with outlined directions for further exploration.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

*Hamid Abdollahi,Amir Hossein Mansouri Majoumerd,Amir Hossein Bagheri Baboukani,Amir Abolfazl Suratgar,Mohammad Bagher Menhaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates brain encoding models using advanced visual and auditory extractors to study their ability to predict brain activity under in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, revealing trade-offs in model complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the critical challenge of predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli and tests the generalization capabilities of encoding models in novel contexts.

Method: State-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper) extractors are used to develop brain encoding models, and their performance is evaluated rigorously across in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Result: Higher-capacity attention models excelled on ID data, while simpler linear models demonstrated greater robustness on OOD datasets, outperforming competitive baselines by 18%. Linguistic features did not enhance accuracy.

Conclusion: The study concludes that rigorous testing on OOD data is crucial for creating robust neuro-AI models, highlights the trade-off between model complexity and generalization, and provides insights into sensory hierarchies shaping neural encoding.

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LOTUS, a leaderboard to evaluate detailed image captions generated by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), addressing standardized criteria, biases, and user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deficiencies in existing evaluations of LVLM image captions, such as lack of standardized criteria, bias awareness, and incorporation of user preference.

Method: The authors developed LOTUS, a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing captions on quality, risks, societal biases, and user preferences.

Result: LOTUS analysis revealed no LVLM excels in all criteria, highlighted correlations between detailed captions and biases, and showed user priorities affect model selection.

Conclusion: Optimal model choice depends on tailoring evaluations to users’ preferences, indicating the need for nuanced assessments like LOTUS in LVLM captioning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

*Chong Xia,Shengjun Zhang,Fangfu Liu,Chang Liu,Khodchaphun Hirunyaratsameewong,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenePainter addresses semantic drift in perpetual 3D scene generation using a hierarchical graph structure for better view consistency and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to improve semantic coherence in long-range 3D scene generation, especially as current methods suffer from semantic drift due to accumulated errors via outpainting.

Method: The proposed method introduces ScenePainter, a framework leveraging a hierarchical graph called SceneConceptGraph to link and refine multi-level scene concepts for guiding the generation of consistent 3D views.

Result: ScenePainter exhibits superior performance in overcoming semantic drift and produces more coherent and immersive 3D view sequences, according to experimental results.

Conclusion: ScenePainter offers a novel solution for semantically consistent and diverse 3D scene generation, addressing limitations of previous methods while enhancing visual coherence.

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) for small object detection, combining an enhanced feature pyramid network (NT-FPN) and a new label assignment method (PS-RPN) to improve robustness and query quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges persist in Transformer-based detectors for small object detection due to noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks and poor query quality with existing label assignment strategies.

Method: The proposed NRQO paradigm integrates NT-FPN to reduce noise and preserve spatial and semantic features and PS-RPN to improve anchor-ground truth matching based on position and shape similarity.

Result: Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate NRQO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in small object detection.

Conclusion: Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network and Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network in the NRQO paradigm enhance small object detection reliability and effectiveness, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMBench-GUI, a benchmark across various platforms to evaluate GUI automation agents, proposing the Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA) metric and emphasizing key factors like grounding, planning, and task efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the lack of a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating essential GUI automation agent capabilities, particularly emphasizing task efficiency and cross-platform generalization.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical evaluation framework (MMBench-GUI) with four levels (GUI Content Understanding, Element Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration) and introduce the Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA) metric for assessing execution efficiency.

Result: The study identifies accurate visual grounding, modular frameworks, task planning, and cross-platform generalization as critical for performance, revealing inefficiencies in all models from redundant steps during task completion.

Conclusion: The integration of precise grounding, robust planning, and early stopping strategies is necessary for efficient and scalable GUI automation. The provided benchmark and metric aim to drive advancements in this domain.

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

*Haochen Han,Alex Jinpeng Wang,Fangming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEAT, a negation-aware test-time adaptation method to address limitations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) when handling negation, bypassing typical data-heavy fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical limitation in VLMs where they fail to understand negation, which is necessary for real-world applications like radiologists excluding specific conditions.

Method: The authors propose NEAT, a method that adjusts distribution-related parameters during inference to tackle negation. It focuses on reducing distribution shifts for consistent semantics and eliminating false consistencies in unrelated semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEAT is effective in improving negation understanding across various tasks.

Conclusion: NEAT offers a resource-efficient and effective solution to improve negation understanding in VLMs without requiring computationally heavy data-centric approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework for improved decoding of stimulus images from fMRI signals, addressing cross-subject variability and cumulative errors using a bidirectional approach and refinement modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals struggle with cross-subject variability and sequential errors, leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity when using pre-trained generative models.

Method: The proposed framework introduces a Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining approach that uses a Subject Bias Modulation Module for unifying subjects, a Semantic Refinement Module for improving semantic accuracy, and a Visual Coherence Module to reduce visual inaccuracies.

Result: The method achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets, both in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrates adaptability to new subjects with minimal training.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the challenge of cross-subject mappings and improves the accuracy of decoded stimulus images, highlighting its practical utility and adaptability in fMRI signal analysis.

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Result: MedSymmFlow achieved comparable or better classification accuracy and AUC compared to existing models, along with superior uncertainty estimation capabilities on four MedMNIST datasets.

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow successfully integrates classification, uncertainty estimation, and generation within a single framework, showing promise for clinical use cases.

well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,

leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in CNNs (long-range dependency issues) and transformers (quadratic computational complexity) for medical anomaly detection and to better utilize the structural regularity of medical radiography images.

Method: The study introduces SP-Mamba, which employs window-sliding prototype learning and Circular-Hilbert scanning techniques to leverage consistent anatomical patterns. It also focuses on anomaly concentration and contrast characteristics.

Result: The extensive experiments on multiple medical anomaly detection benchmarks demonstrate SP-Mamba’s superior performance in terms of efficacy and robustness.

Conclusion: SP-Mamba effectively utilizes structural features and spatial information, providing state-of-the-art results in unsupervised medical anomaly detection with linear computational efficiency.

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in balancing shared representations with task-specific specialization in multi-task learning for dense prediction.

Method: The FGMoE framework integrates three key innovations: intra-task experts for finer task decomposition, shared experts to reduce redundancy, and a global expert for adaptive knowledge transfer. Fine-tuning is also applied to enhance parameter efficiency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that FGMoE achieves superior performance with fewer parameters compared to existing MoE-based MTL models on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets.

Conclusion: The FGMoE architecture successfully advances multi-task learning for dense prediction, leveraging fine-grained expert designs and efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchTraj proposes a patch-based framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing trajectory prediction methods, particularly in modeling human motion dynamics and incorporating frequency domain interactions.

Method: Patch-based approach combining trajectory decomposition into time and frequency components, dynamic patch partitioning, adaptive embedding, hierarchical feature aggregation, and a Transformer-based encoder-decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets.

Conclusion: Unifying temporal and spectral representations with cross-modal attention enhances trajectory modeling, providing robust and efficient prediction results.

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucinations in multimodal LLMs by introducing LISA, a hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion approach to improve generation consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to solve a crucial limitation in multimodal large language models (MLLMs): their tendency for object hallucinations, where they describe objects not present in an image.

Method: They propose LISA (Layer-wise Integration and Suppression Approach), which includes (1) zone-specific spectral modulation for stabilizing attention by suppressing noisy activations in deeper layers, and (2) token-level logit fusion based on adaptive anchor-based routing for decoding.

Result: LISA significantly reduces hallucinations by up to 53.6% on the CHAIR_I benchmark and improves POPE F1 score by 4.5%, demonstrating enhanced consistency across various models and tasks.

Conclusion: LISA is a plug-and-play method that can easily integrate into existing MLLMs, effectively improving their performance by reducing hallucinations and enhancing generation consistency across vision-language applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in cross-modal remote sensing image matching by proposing a mechanism, CSTF, that improves feature alignment and matching for multimodal images, achieving state-of-the-art results in object detection benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve difficulties in aligning features from multimodal remote sensing images, where traditional methods struggle with capturing similarities due to geometric and radiometric differences.

Method: The CSTF mechanism integrates scale-invariant keypoints, correspondence maps, and reformulates similarity matching as a classification problem using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Networks.

Result: The CSTF model demonstrates an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA datasets, surpassing existing models for remote sensing object detection tasks.

Conclusion: The CSTF mechanism effectively improves feature matching across diverse image modalities, contributing to enhanced performance in downstream remote sensing tasks such as object detection while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes TopGeoFormer, an end-to-end architecture for point cloud recovery, leveraging both topological and geometric features to enhance sampling and restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to effectively leverage topological and geometric attributes during point cloud recovery, creating a need for improved techniques.

Method: The method employs topological embedding for structure preservation, InterTwining Attention for merging embeddings, and introduces geometry and topological constraint losses for optimization.

Result: The proposed method significantly outperformed existing sampling and recovery methods, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer is effective in maintaining critical topological and geometric features, resulting in improved point cloud recovery.

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling

### [115] [MixA-Q: Revisiting Activation Sparsity for Vision Transformers from a Mixed-Precision Quantization Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19131)
*Weitian Wang,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization framework for vision transformers that exploits activation sparsity, providing improved trade-offs between efficiency and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers require efficient computation for real-world applications, but existing uniform quantization methods often compromise performance due to activation sparsity.

Method: MixA-Q assigns varying bit widths to activations based on importance, incorporates a Two-Branch Swin Block for processing high- and low-bit precision activations, and integrates with quantization-aware training or post-training quantization.

Result: MixA-Q achieves up to 1.35x computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration and 1.53x speedup with a small 1% mAP drop in QAT setup.

Conclusion: MixA-Q effectively trades computational efficiency for performance through sparsity-aware quantization and reduces quantization degradation in critical regions of the model.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

*Tianyu Zou,Shengwu Xiong,Ruilin Yao,Yi Rong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAHNet to improve few-shot segmentation by balancing conservative and aggressive prediction styles, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The predictions made by existing prototype and affinity learning-based FSS methods either lean too conservative or aggressive, necessitating a balanced approach to enhance performance.

Method: The authors propose PAHNet, which combines prototype learning with affinity learning. It utilizes a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and Attention Score Calibration (ASC) module to balance foreground and background relationships.

Result: PAHNet demonstrates superior segmentation performance in 1-shot and 5-shot tasks, outperforming recent models on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets.

Conclusion: By integrating the strengths of prototype and affinity learning frameworks, PAHNet effectively achieves a balance that improves accuracy and generalizability in FSS tasks.

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

### [117] [DASH: 4D Hash Encoding with Self-Supervised Decomposition for Real-Time Dynamic Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19141)
*Jie Chen,Zhangchi Hu,Peixi Wu,Huyue Zhu,Hebei Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DASH is a real-time framework for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction using 4D hash encoding and self-supervised decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in dynamic scene reconstruction which include low-rank assumptions in Gaussian splatting leading to feature overlap, and inefficiencies in 4D hash encoding such as hash collisions and redundancy.

Method: The framework introduces self-supervised decomposition of dynamic and static components, multiresolution 4D hash encoding for dynamic elements, and spatio-temporal smoothness regularization to counter deformation artifacts.

Result: DASH delivers state-of-the-art performance with improved rendering quality and achieves real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Conclusion: The DASH framework effectively addresses challenges in dynamic scene reconstruction and offers superior visual quality, making it a leading solution for real-time rendering in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

### [118] [Patch Pruning Strategy Based on Robust Statistical Measures of Attention Weight Diversity in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19175)
*Yuki Igaue,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient patch pruning strategy for vision transformers that uses the variance of attention weights to enhance computational performance without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision transformers' multi-head self-attention mechanism has high computational costs, and patch pruning is a promising solution for reducing this complexity.

Method: The strategy evaluates patch importance using the variance or median absolute deviation of attention weights across multiple heads and incorporates overlapping patch embeddings.

Result: The method maintains classification accuracy and improves throughput during both training and inference while optimizing pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances efficiency and accuracy, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained scenarios in vision transformers.

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

*Kotha Kartheek,Lingamaneni Gnanesh Chowdary,Snehasis Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified model for restoring images degraded by diverse weather conditions using a continual learning framework involving feature fusion, elastic weight consolidation, and a novel loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating a unified model for image restoration is essential for applications like autonomous driving, as existing methods work only for specific weather conditions.

Method: The approach integrates Selective Kernel Fusion layers, Elastic Weight Consolidation for continual learning, and a Cycle-Contrastive Loss for preserving semantic consistency during restoration.

Result: The proposed method shows significant improvement in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality on standard datasets for dehazing, desnowing, and deraining compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The framework successfully restores images under diverse weather conditions while addressing training data reliance and mitigating catastrophic forgetting through continual learning.

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisHall3D introduces a two-stage framework addressing feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency in monocular semantic scene completion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address issues in monocular semantic scene completion, particularly feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency in existing methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: Stage 1 reconstructs visible regions using VisFrontierNet; Stage 2 infers invisible regions using OcclusionMAE with a noise injection mechanism.

Result: Validated on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, outperforms previous methods by a significant margin.

Conclusion: Effective decomposition into stages leads to substantial improvements, paving the way for better scene understanding in applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

*Xiaoyu Zhang,Zhifeng Bao,Hai Dong,Ziwei Wang,Jiajun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CounterNet, a network that improves object counting accuracy in 3D point cloud data for autonomous vehicles, addressing errors in prior models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable precise querying and analytics on massive point cloud data from autonomous vehicles by addressing inaccuracies in object counting, a critical aspect for tasks like collision detection and traffic analysis.

Method: The authors introduce CounterNet, a heatmap-based network that focuses on object counting by identifying object centers rather than localization. They enhance performance using feature map partitioning with overlapping regions and a dynamic model selection strategy for varying frame characteristics.

Result: CounterNet achieves 5% to 20% better counting accuracy across object categories and enhances the reliability of query outcomes for RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION tasks.

Conclusion: CounterNet effectively addresses the limitations in object counting for large-scale 3D point cloud data, improving query accuracy and analytics in autonomous vehicle datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

*Hanbing Wu,Ping Jiang,Anyang Su,Chenxu Zhao,Tianyu Fu,Minghui Wu,Beiping Tan,Huiying Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Traditional saliency models fail to account for individual cognitive differences in fixation behavior, relying on outdated low-resolution approaches. This paper introduces SPA-ADV, a multimodal gaze dataset of advertisement videos collected from diverse participants, and PRE-MAP, a reinforcement learning eye-tracking model guided by personalized profiles for precise predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The researchers aim to bridge the gap between subjective cognitive diversity in visual attention and conventional saliency prediction models, which often neglect personalized fixation behavior.

Method: The paper introduces SPA-ADV, a dataset capturing diverse gaze behaviors, and PRE-MAP, an eye-tracking model using reinforcement learning and multi-attribute user profiles, paired with Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO) for format accuracy and spatial precision.

Result: PRE-MAP demonstrates superior performance on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in personalized saliency prediction and point positioning.

Conclusion: The research presents SPA-ADV and PRE-MAP as innovative solutions to address shortcomings in traditional saliency prediction models, contributing significantly to personalized attention modeling.

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel three-stream MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network, leveraging LiDAR and RGB data for enhanced outdoor 3D object detection. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of effectively combining LiDAR and RGB data modalities for outdoor 3D object detection and improving accuracy.

Method: The MuStD network has a three-stream architecture: LiDAR-PillarNet for 2D pillar features, LiDAR-Height Compression for Bird’s-Eye View features, and a 3D Multimodal stream that combines RGB and LiDAR using UV mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Features are fused and sent to a detection head.

Result: Extensive testing on the KITTI Object Detection Benchmark demonstrates that the MuStD network achieves new state-of-the-art results or remains highly competitive across categories while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed MuStD network offers a reliable and efficient method for integrating LiDAR and RGB data, enhancing 3D object detection performance.

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework using large language models (LLMs) to generate dynamic, multi-human virtual scenes with contextual motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of generating scalable, dynamic, and context-aware motions for multiple virtual humans in a dynamic scene.

Method: Utilizes an event generator to break down scene progression into small events, synthesizes motions based on spatial guidance, and employs high-level modules to translate events into coordinate descriptions.

Result: Demonstrates that the framework effectively captures scene context while maintaining scalability and diversity, as validated by benchmark results and user studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves scalable and diverse event-driven storytelling for multi-agent motion and sets a benchmark for contextual reasoning.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDE introduces a sparse, interpretable prototype-based method to enhance explainability in deep learning models without compromising accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models, particularly in computer vision, often lack transparency in high-stakes domains. Existing prototype-based explainability methods are either limited to fine-grained tasks or provide overly complex explanations.

Method: SIDE is a new method that uses a sparse training and pruning scheme along with sigmoid activations to improve the interpretability of prototypes, associating each class with fewer, more relevant prototypes.

Result: SIDE achieves accuracy comparable to existing methods while decreasing explanation size by over 90%, increasing the clarity and understanding of prototype-based models.

Conclusion: SIDE's sparsity-driven approach successfully enhances prototype interpretability and retains performance, making it highly applicable to critical areas requiring explainability in AI.

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoopTrack, a new framework for cooperative 3D multi-object tracking that uses learnable instance association to improve tracking performance while keeping transmission costs low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of single-vehicle autonomous systems by developing cooperative sequential perception models for tasks like 3D object tracking, which remain underexplored.

Method: The method involves CoopTrack, which transmits sparse instance-level features and employs modules for feature extraction and cross-agent association. This enables robust instance representation and adaptive data fusion using a feature graph.

Result: CoopTrack achieved state-of-the-art performance on the V2X-Seq dataset with 39.0% mAP and 32.8% AMOTA, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: CoopTrack significantly improves cooperative 3D multi-object tracking with efficient information exchange, reducing transmission costs while demonstrating high performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

*An Xiang,Zixuan Huang,Xitong Gao,Kejiang Ye,Cheng-zhong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified 2D-3D multimodal anomaly detection framework, overcoming limitations in current methods by learning from both RGB and 3D depth data. It includes novel generators for creating anomalies and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to represent 3D depth anomalies in multimodal scenarios due to disparities between RGB and point cloud depth data. There is also a lack of realistic abnormal samples in industrial multimodal datasets, necessitating better anomaly generation techniques.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that disentangles depth and appearance by representing 3D point cloud data as visible depth and 2D RGB images. It introduces Multi-Scale Gaussian and Unified Texture Anomaly Generators to create realistic anomalies for both RGB and depth data. The modules share parameters for better integration of 2D and 3D modalities.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, successfully validating its robustness on MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed unified anomaly detection framework overcomes the challenges of multimodal 2D-3D scenarios by bridging RGB and depth data. Its parameter-sharing and flexible input representation enable better anomaly generation, advancing the field and providing a strong foundation for industrial applications.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces OV-Fact, a new method to evaluate the factuality of long vision-language captions using visual grounding and tool-based verification, resolving issues with traditional measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the challenge of evaluating long, diverse, and factual captions generated by large vision-language models without relying on ground-truth human annotations.

Method: OV-Fact leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based verification to evaluate caption descriptiveness (recall) and factual precision through a reference-free metric.

Result: The proposed metric aligns better with human judgments and enables improved factuality precision in captions when used for data filtering, without reducing descriptiveness.

Conclusion: OV-Fact offers an effective solution for evaluating and enhancing long caption factuality, showing potential for improving training datasets and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

### [129] [SimMLM: A Simple Framework for Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19264)
*Sijie Li,Chen Chen,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimMLM introduces a simple framework for multimodal learning in scenarios with missing data, leveraging dynamic modality experts and a ranking loss to improve robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning effectively with incomplete multimodal data while improving accuracy and stability.

Method: SimMLM uses Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) with learnable gating mechanisms and a More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss for adaptive contribution from available modalities.

Result: SimMLM demonstrated superior results in tasks like multimodal medical image segmentation and classification, outperforming competitive approaches.

Conclusion: SimMLM is effective, reliable, and interpretable, catering to multimodal challenges with missing data while maintaining or improving accuracy across diverse tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

*Marcel Simon,Tae-Ho Kim,Seul-Ki Yeom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance single-image self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders by using video-based temporal cues. Experiments show improved semantic segmentation accuracy using this approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO lack the ability to leverage temporal cues present in videos, which could improve robust visual feature learning.

Method: They proposed a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict next-frame representations from the current frame, using video temporal cues without relying on optical flow or tracking.

Result: Pre-training on a 2-hour video increased the mean IoU on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4, showing improved performance in a geometry-aware perception task.

Conclusion: Video self-distillation offers a lightweight way to enhance self-supervised learning pipelines and contributes to the development of physically plausible world models and AI systems.

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

*Liang Yao,Fan Liu,Hongbo Lu,Chuanyi Zhang,Rui Min,Shengxiang Xu,Shimin Di,Pai Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RemoteReasoner, a framework integrating multimodal large language models (MLLM) with reinforcement learning to handle complex and diverse reasoning tasks in remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing remote sensing approaches that rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning, constraining their autonomy and adaptability for complex queries.

Method: The proposed method, RemoteReasoner, combines multimodal large language models (MLLM) for interpreting instructions and localizing tasks, with reinforcement learning and task adaptation strategies. This allows for unified reasoning tasks without needing predefined reasoning paths or additional refinements.

Result: RemoteReasoner shows excellent performance across various reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level granularity, enabling novel capabilities like contour extraction that current methods cannot achieve.

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner provides a robust, flexible, and autonomous Earth observation reasoning framework that advances the field of remote sensing through diverse and adaptable output handling.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

*Sakuya Ota,Qing Yu,Kent Fujiwara,Satoshi Ikehata,Ikuro Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PINO, a framework for generating realistic group interactions by decomposing them into pairwise interactions and using physics-based noise optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with generating nuanced and controllable group interactions, particularly as group size grows.

Method: PINO decouples group interactions into pairwise sequences, leverages pretrained diffusion models for composition, and applies physics-based penalties during noise optimization.

Result: The framework yields visually realistic, physics coherent, and adaptable multi-person interactions without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: PINO successfully delivers customizable group interactions applicable in animation, gaming, and robotics, overcoming limitations of single-prompt methods.

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

*Ahmed Endris Hasen,Yang Shangming,Chiagoziem C. Ukwuoma,Biniyam Gashaw,Abel Zenebe Yutra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved version of YOLOX for automatic detection of various blood cells using enhancements like CBAM and ASFF modules, achieving higher accuracy and speed over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual blood cell detection is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors. The paper aims to address these limitations using a deep learning-based approach.

Method: The authors improve the YOLOX object detector by integrating CBAM in the network backbone, adding the ASFF in the network's neck for better feature fusion, and replacing IOU loss with CIOU loss for faster convergence.

Result: The proposed ABCD method achieves 95.49% mAP@0.5 and 86.89% mAP@0.5-0.9, outperforming the baseline by 2.8% and 23.41% respectively, and increases detection speed by 2.9%.

Conclusion: ABCD represents an efficient and effective deep learning-based solution for real-time blood cell detection, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

*Rajesh Madhipati,Sheethal Bhat,Lukas Buess,Andreas Maier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses class imbalance in medical image classification using self-supervised deep learning and Vision-Language models, introducing a class-weighting mechanism for improved long-tailed class accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised deep learning models struggle with class imbalance in medical datasets, particularly underperforming on rare or long-tailed classes, necessitating methods to enhance classification accuracy.

Method: The study enhances classification by employing Gaussian Mixture Model clustering in the latent space, refining clusters with Student t-distribution, and applying metric loss for improved feature embeddings.

Result: Using the outlined method, the proposed approach achieves a 7% improvement in zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset compared to previous state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that adaptive clustering in latent space via class-weighting and embedding refinement leads to significant performance improvements, especially for underrepresented classes in CXR datasets.

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

*Lanmiao Liu,Esam Ghaleb,Aslı Özyürek,Zerrin Yumak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for co-speech gesture generation that ensures semantic and rhythmic coherence between gestures and speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy in co-speech gesture generation methods that typically focus on rhythmic beat gestures without considering semantic alignment with speech.

Method: The approach involves training a vector-quantized variational autoencoder to learn motion prior, followed by a module that generates gestures considering semantic information from speech, text, and speaker identity, achieving semantic alignment using specialized coherence and relevance modules.

Result: The method improves the realism and semantic coherence of generated gestures, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across objective and subjective metrics on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: By integrating fine-grained and global semantic information, the proposed approach advances the field of co-speech gesture generation, providing significant improvements in aligning gestures with speech semantics.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes EA-ViT, an adaptation framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that generates models of varying sizes from a single process to accommodate different resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for adapting Vision Transformers to varying resource constraints involve retraining separate models, which is inefficient in terms of time and energy.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage process: (1) augment a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture and use curriculum-based training to enhance structural flexibility, and (2) design a lightweight router informed by a Pareto-optimal configuration to select submodels tailored for specific constraints.

Result: EA-ViT shows effectiveness and versatility across multiple benchmarks, proving it can handle diverse computational budgets and task requirements.

Conclusion: EA-ViT streamlines the process of adapting ViTs to diverse constraints, offering a practical, efficient solution for deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents BEV-LLM, a lightweight model for 3D scene captioning in autonomous driving, achieving competitive results with innovative methods and introducing new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve interpretability and transparency in autonomous driving systems by advancing scene captioning technology, which is critical for safety and human-AI interaction.

Method: BEV-LLM combines 3D LiDAR and multi-view imagery through BEVFusion, with a novel positional encoding for precise scene descriptions, utilizing a relatively small model architecture.

Result: BEV-LLM achieves competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art BLEU scores by up to 5%. Two new datasets, nuView and GroundView, are introduced for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: BEV-LLM demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight 3D scene captioning for autonomous driving, while new datasets further enhance benchmarking capabilities across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

*Toufiq Parag,Ahmed Elgammal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAELRE, a transformer architecture that efficiently handles long-context processing on a single device by combining token merging and attention approximation, achieving better accuracy and computational cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to address the inefficiency of processing long contexts with transformers under generic single-device implementations, especially given the quadratic memory and computational complexity of traditional attention mechanisms.

Method: MAELRE combines token merging with attention approximation, progressively merging tokens across computational stages. It employs lightweight attention for large token sequences and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence shortens.

Result: MAELRE achieved superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing long-context models tested on classification tasks in multiple modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

Conclusion: MAELRE offers a modality-agnostic, efficient approach to long-context encoding, overcoming limitations of existing strategies and enabling better trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency on diverse tasks and modalities.

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

TL;DR: This paper introduces DEFNet, a multitask deep learning framework for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) with improved uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BIQA methods face challenges in maintaining integration and providing reliable uncertainty estimation, leading to less optimal performance.

Method: The authors propose a multitask optimization model that incorporates scene and distortion classification tasks, alongside a novel trustworthy fusion mechanism combining local-global information.

Result: DEFNet outperforms established methods on datasets with synthetic and authentic distortions, showcasing superior robustness, generalization, and adaptability.

Conclusion: DEFNet proves to be an effective solution for BIQA challenges, combining multitask learning with advanced uncertainty estimation techniques.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a circuit-based framework to explore spatiotemporal visual semantics in large vision-language models (LVLMs), revealing important insights into object token localization, semantic refinement, and functional specialization in middle-to-late model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited understanding of how LVLMs process spatiotemporal semantics, which has implications for improving their robustness and interpretability.

Method: The authors propose a systematic framework with three circuits: visual auditing, semantic tracing, and attention flow, to analyze spatiotemporal representation and processing in LVLMs.

Result: They find that visual semantics are strongly tied to specific object tokens, with their removal leading to performance degradation of up to 92.6%. Additionally, semantic concepts refine in middle-to-late layers, showing specialization for spatiotemporal understanding.

Conclusion: The study uncovers key mechanisms in LVLMs for spatiotemporal semantics, offering a groundwork for designing improved models with better interpretability and performance.

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework for reconstructing occupancy in autonomous driving, overcoming limitations of LiDAR-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based occupancy methods limit scalability and prevent the use of large-scale, crowdsourced data for autonomous driving perception.

Method: GS-Occ3D utilizes an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation for efficient and scalable occupancy representation, while decomposing scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects for tailored modeling.

Result: GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction on the Waymo dataset, effective vision-only binary occupancy labels, and superior zero-shot generalization on other datasets.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that vision-based occupancy reconstruction is a scalable and effective paradigm for autonomous driving, advancing perception capabilities without relying on LiDAR.

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Conclusion: DINO-world is a robust model that excels in predicting video dynamics, which can also be fine-tuned for action-based planning through simulated trajectories in latent space.

Abstract: We present DINO-world, a powerful generalist video world model trained to
predict future frames in the latent space of DINOv2. By leveraging a
pre-trained image encoder and training a future predictor on a large-scale
uncurated video dataset, DINO-world learns the temporal dynamics of diverse
scenes, from driving and indoor scenes to simulated environments. We show that
DINO-world outperforms previous models on a variety of video prediction
benchmarks, e.g. segmentation and depth forecasting, and demonstrates strong
understanding of intuitive physics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to
fine-tune the predictor on observation-action trajectories. The resulting
action-conditioned world model can be used for planning by simulating candidate
trajectories in latent space.

Abstract: This paper presents DINO-SLAM, a DINO-informed design strategy to enhance
neural implicit (Neural Radiance Field -- NeRF) and explicit representations
(3D Gaussian Splatting -- 3DGS) in SLAM systems through more comprehensive
scene representations. Purposely, we rely on a Scene Structure Encoder (SSE)
that enriches DINO features into Enhanced DINO ones (EDINO) to capture
hierarchical scene elements and their structural relationships. Building upon
it, we propose two foundational paradigms for NeRF and 3DGS SLAM systems
integrating EDINO features. Our DINO-informed pipelines achieve superior
performance on the Replica, ScanNet, and TUM compared to state-of-the-art

*Byungjun Kim,Shunsuke Saito,Giljoo Nam,Tomas Simon,Jason Saragih,Hanbyul Joo,Junxuan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D head avatar model with disentangled face and hair representations to enable applications like face and hairstyle swapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for 3D head avatars struggle to disentangle face and hair representations and lack flexibility for applications such as swapping due to holistic modeling of face and hair.

Method: The authors create a synthetic hairless dataset and train separate latent spaces for face and hair representations, incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias.

Result: The proposed model enables seamless transfer of face and hair components, supports few-shot fine-tuning for new subjects, and produces high-fidelity 3D avatars.

Conclusion: The presented approach achieves flexible, controllable, and expressive 3D avatar generation with potential real-world applicability.

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

*Yanbo Zhao,Jinku Cui,Zecheng Li,Shuyin Jiao,Xu Liu,Jiajia Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: cuThermo is a GPU memory profiling tool that identifies inefficiencies using heatmaps and enables optimization to improve performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of fine-grained, runtime profiling support for analyzing GPU memory bottlenecks.

Method: cuThermo analyzes GPU binaries to generate heatmaps and provides optimization guidance without requiring hardware, OS, or source code modifications.

Result: Experiments showed five common memory access patterns across GPUs, and optimization with cuThermo led to performance improvements up to 721.79%.

Conclusion: cuThermo demonstrates its practicality and effectiveness in identifying and addressing GPU memory inefficiencies to achieve substantial performance gains.

Abstract: GPUs have become indispensable in high-performance computing, machine
learning, and many other domains. Efficiently utilizing the memory subsystem on
GPUs is critical for maximizing computing power through massive parallelism.
Analyzing memory access patterns has proven to be an effective method for
understanding memory bottlenecks in applications. However, comprehensive
runtime and fine-grained memory profiling support is lacking on GPU
architectures. In this work, we introduce cuThermo, a lightweight and practical
profiling tool for GPU memory analysis. It operates on GPU binaries without
requiring any modifications to hardware, operating system, or application
source code. Given a CUDA application, cuThermo identifies memory
inefficiencies at runtime via a heat map based on distinct visited warp counts
to represent word-sector-level data sharing and provides optimization guidance
in performance tuning iterations. Through our experiments on six applications,
we identified five memory access patterns that are portable across different
GPU architectures. By evaluating optimization on two GPUs, cuThermo achieves up
to $721.79\%$ performance improvement.

*Z. Jonny Kong,Qiang Xu,Y. Charlie Hu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper presents PPipe, an inference serving system that leverages pipeline parallelism on heterogeneous GPU clusters, achieving significantly improved throughput and utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently utilizing heterogeneous GPU clusters for latency-sensitive tasks like model inference, particularly exploiting the potential of low-class GPUs.

Method: The work introduces 'PPipe,' an inference system that deploys pool-based pipeline parallelism, MILP-based control plane, and resource reservation-based adaptive batching in the data plane.

Result: PPipe improved the utilization of low-class GPUs by 41.1%-65.5%, maintaining high-class GPU utilization, and increased serving throughput by 32.2%-75.1% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Pipeline parallelism can effectively optimize heterogeneous GPU resources for model inference, enhancing overall throughput and system performance.

Abstract: With the rapid innovation of GPUs, heterogeneous GPU clusters in both public
clouds and on-premise data centers have become increasingly commonplace. In
this paper, we demonstrate how pipeline parallelism, a technique wellstudied
for throughput-oriented deep learning model training, can be used effectively
for serving latency-bound model inference, e.g., in video analytics systems, on
heterogeneous GPU clusters. Our work exploits the synergy between diversity in
model layers and diversity in GPU architectures, which results in comparable
inference latency for many layers when running on low-class and high-class
GPUs. We explore how such overlooked capability of low-class GPUs can be
exploited using pipeline parallelism and present a novel inference serving
system, PPipe, that employs pool-based pipeline parallelism via an MILP-based
control plane and a data plane that performs resource reservation-based
adaptive batching. Evaluation results on diverse workloads (18 CNN models) show
that PPipe achieves 41.1% - 65.5% higher utilization of low-class GPUs while
maintaining high utilization of high-class GPUs, leading to 32.2% - 75.1%
higher serving throughput compared to various baselines.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an optimal job scheduling algorithm for MEC and cloud systems that ensures task deadlines are met. The algorithm achieves low complexity and addresses challenges with randomly arriving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve user experiences by addressing computation-intensive tasks requiring stringent deadlines and low latency in MEC and cloud systems.

Method: The paper presents a job scheduling algorithm with computational efficiency (O(nlogn)) and an online approach for random task arrivals, with outage detection and rapid acceptance (O(n)).

Result: Extensive numerical results show improvements in service ratios and reduced scheduling costs.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively optimizes task scheduling while balancing performance, complexity, and robustness against uncertainty.

Abstract: The demand for stringent interactive quality-of-service has intensified in
both mobile edge computing (MEC) and cloud systems, driven by the imperative to
improve user experiences. As a result, the processing of computation-intensive
tasks in these systems necessitates adherence to specific deadlines or
achieving extremely low latency. To optimize task scheduling performance,
existing research has mainly focused on reducing the number of late jobs whose
deadlines are not met. However, the primary challenge with these methods lies
in the total search time and scheduling efficiency. In this paper, we present
the optimal job scheduling algorithm designed to determine the optimal task
order for a given set of tasks. In addition, users are enabled to make informed
decisions for offloading tasks based on the information provided by servers.
The details of performance analysis are provided to show its optimality and low
complexity with the linearithmic time O(nlogn), where $n$ is the number of
tasks. To tackle the uncertainty of the randomly arriving tasks, we further
develop an online approach with fast outage detection that achieves rapid
acceptance times with time complexity of O(n). Extensive numerical results are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of
the service ratio and scheduling cost.

*Yufang Li,Yuanbo Zhang,Hanlong Liao,Guoming Tang,Deke Guo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GPUnion is a GPU sharing platform tailored for campuses, enabling resource sharing while maintaining provider autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disparity in GPU resource availability on campuses, where resources in some labs are underutilized while others face shortages.

Method: GPUnion employs a decentralized system with container-based task execution, provider-first architecture, and resilient execution features like automatic checkpointing and migration.

Result: Case studies showed a 30% increase in GPU utilization, a 40% rise in interactive sessions, and 94% successful workload migration during provider unavailability.

Conclusion: The platform successfully balances provider autonomy and reliability, democratizing computational access and challenging centralized paradigms in campus GPU sharing.

Abstract: A pronounced imbalance in GPU resources exists on campus, where some
laboratories own underutilized servers while others lack the compute needed for
AI research. GPU sharing can alleviate this disparity, while existing platforms
typically rely on centralized oversight and persistent allocation models,
conflicting with the voluntary and autonomous nature of academic resource
ownership. We present GPUnion, a campus-scale GPU sharing platform enabling
voluntary participation while preserving full provider autonomy. GPUnion
incorporates three core mechanisms: i) container-based task dispatching and
execution, ii) resource provider-first architecture, and iii) resilient
execution featuring automatic checkpointing and migration. GPUnion also
supports custom data storage and integrates the non-root execution and image
attestation for isolation and security improvement for containerization. Case
studies across multiple campus scenarios demonstrate 30% more GPU utilization
improvement, 40% increase in interactive sessions, and 94% successful workload
migration during provider departures. GPUnion demonstrates that provider
autonomy and platform reliability can coexist, challenging conventional
centralized paradigms and democratizing access to computational resources
within campus networks.

### [149] [The Case for Time-Shared Computing Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19287)
*Pierre Jacquet,Adrien Luxey-Bitri*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: This paper discusses the environmental challenges of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and argues for improving resource sharing among tenants to reduce physical computing resources and improve energy efficiency, even at the cost of reduced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing environmental footprint of ICT, driven by increasing usage, rebound effects, and demands, necessitates better resource management due to the finite availability of physical resources.

Method: The paper advocates for enhancing mutualization of infrastructure by revisiting and innovating resource-sharing mechanisms, shifting away from traditional time-sharing to achieve consolidation and energy efficiency.

Result: Improving resource sharing can reduce the size of hosting facilities and boost energy efficiency, emphasizing an acceptable trade-off between performance and infrastructure consolidation.

Conclusion: The paper outlines challenges, opportunities, and research directions for resource sharing in ICT, suggesting that this paradigm shift can improve sustainability while mitigating the need to eliminate services.

Abstract: The environmental impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
continues to grow, driven notably by increasing usage, rebound effects, and
emerging demands. However, despite the virtual nature of its services, the
sector remains inherently constrained by its materiality and cannot rely on an
infinite pool of resources. As a result, the wide variety of supported services
may need to be managed under stricter limits within hosting facilities in the
future. Contrary to common assumptions, we show that tenants typically do not
share computing resources, even in environments commonly perceived as
mutualized, such as cloud platforms. Time-sharing has been progressively phased
out for reasons of performance, security, predictability, and, perhaps more
importantly, due to the decreasing cost of computing resources. This paper
advocates for managing fewer physical resources by improving resource sharing
between tenants. It represents a paradigm shift, moving beyond traditional
time-sharing at the hardware level to a higher abstraction. This approach
entails "doing with fewer resources" under conditions of "reduced performance".
Nonetheless, enhancing the mutualization of infrastructure can reduce cluster
sizes (through consolidation) and improve energy efficiency, with gains related
to the accepted performance trade-off, a situation potentially more socially
acceptable than eliminating services. We review the current state of the art,
identify challenges and opportunities, propose interpretations of Time-Shared
Computing, and outline key research directions.

*Saeed Mohseni-Sehdeh,Walid Saad,Kei Sakaguchi,Tao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel piecewise guidance-based diffusion framework for efficiently solving inverse problems like image inpainting and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address computational inefficiency and task-specific limitations in existing approaches for solving inverse problems using diffusion models.

Method: The method employs a piecewise guidance scheme where the guidance term varies across diffusion timesteps to balance computational efficiency and approximation accuracy.

Result: The framework demonstrates reduced inference time (up to 25% for inpainting and around 24% for super-resolution tasks) with negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is problem-agnostic, adaptable to multiple inverse problems, effectively incorporates measurement noise, and offers a computationally efficient alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

TL;DR: DGAKT introduces a graph neural network model to enhance computational efficiency in knowledge tracing by utilizing high-order information from subgraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT methods are computationally inefficient when dealing with large graphs and long learning sequences.

Method: DGAKT uses a subgraph-based graph neural network approach to process relevant subgraphs for each interaction.

Result: Experimental results show DGAKT achieves higher performance and better resource efficiency compared to prior KT models.

Conclusion: DGAKT addresses computational inefficiency in KT methods by leveraging subgraph-based processing, improving performance and resource usage.

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automated method for identifying the optimal layer to probe in neural networks for specific human-defined concepts, validated through empirical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dependency of concept probing on the choice of internal network layers makes it challenging to determine the appropriate layer for probing.

Method: An automated method evaluates layer representations in neural networks based on their informativeness and regularity with respect to a human-defined concept of interest.

Result: The proposed method is validated through exhaustive empirical analysis across different models and datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates an effective approach to optimize layer selection for concept probing, enhancing the interpretability and utility of neural networks.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

TL;DR: Innovator prevents catastrophic forgetting in LLMs while boosting scientific and general task performance by transforming the model into a Mixtures-of-Experts structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for an LLM capable of handling both scientific knowledge and general tasks without sacrificing performance in either domain.

Method: A four-stage upcycle training paradigm involving expert induction, splitting, routing warmup, and integration training on hybrid datasets.

Result: Innovator significantly improves scientific task performance by 25% on average while retaining 99% general task performance.

Conclusion: Innovator successfully addresses knowledge decoupling issues, advancing the ability of LLMs in scientific reasoning without compromising general task capabilities.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

TL;DR: The paper applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to market making in financial markets, introducing innovative methods for inventory management and non-stationary market dynamics adaptation, achieving superior performance over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Market makers are essential for liquidity but face challenges like inventory risk and competition. This paper seeks to adapt RL techniques for creating effective and adaptive market making strategies.

Method: The authors formulated the market making problem as a reinforcement learning task, using single and multi-agent systems with reward engineering and Pareto optimization for inventory management. A novel POW-dTS algorithm was developed for dynamic policy adaptation.

Result: Experimental findings showed that RL-based strategies outperform traditional market making algorithms across various metrics, proving the efficacy of these methods.

Conclusion: Deep RL provides transformative methodologies for creating adaptive, autonomous market making agents and showcases its potential in financial algorithmic trading.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces GENIAL, a Transformer-based machine-learning framework for optimizing arithmetic units, achieving significant efficiency improvements in digital circuit design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing prevalence of AI workloads necessitates optimized arithmetic units to reduce hardware footprint, but traditional design approaches fail to effectively explore the extensive design space.

Method: GENIAL uses a Transformer-based surrogate model, with self-supervised pretraining and supervised finetuning, to predict key hardware metrics and invert the model to find optimized operand encodings.

Result: GENIAL outperforms other methods in sample efficiency and convergence speed, discovering operand encodings that save up to 18% in switching activity for multipliers and improving designs for diverse logic functions.

Conclusion: GENIAL represents a significant advancement in automated combinational circuit design, demonstrating improvements in efficiency and its versatility across various use cases.

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Jie Ji,Ruimeng Ye,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces an "un-pruning" algorithm to address challenges in "machine unlearning" for sparse models, presenting theoretical bounds and novel metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the practical need for ensuring machine learning models comply with the right to be forgotten, particularly focusing on sparse models and how deleted data affects pruning.

Method: The authors define and develop an "un-pruning" algorithm to mitigate the impact of deleted data on pruned sparse model topologies, while proposing performance metrics tailored for sparse models.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the un-pruning algorithm is effective across various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms, while highlighting unreliability issues in traditional Membership Inference Attack evaluations.

Conclusion: Un-pruning provides a promising approach for eliminating the influence of deleted data in sparse models, offering a generalizable framework and more reliable performance evaluation metrics than existing methods.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted
data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the
success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not
yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

*Pedro R. Pires,Gregorio F. Azevedo,Pietro L. Campos,Rafael T. Sereicikas,Tiago A. Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Offline evaluations of contextual linear Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) highlight inadequacies in assessing exploration strategies, as greedy models focused on exploitation outperform exploratory ones in most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the limitations of offline assessments in reliably evaluating exploration strategies in Multi-Armed Bandits, particularly in the context of recommender systems.

Method: An extensive offline empirical comparison of multiple contextual linear MABs across varied datasets, focusing on the performance of greedy exploitation-only models versus exploratory strategies.

Result: Greedy exploitation-only linear models consistently outperform or match exploratory counterparts across 90% of datasets. Hyperparameter tuning further confirms minimal exploration configurations are preferred.

Conclusion: Offline evaluation methodologies fail to adequately assess the value of exploration in MAB algorithms, necessitating the development of improved frameworks for evaluating exploration-exploitation trade-offs in recommender systems.

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender

### [158] [CLEAR: Unlearning Spurious Style-Content Associations with Contrastive LEarning with Anti-contrastive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18794)
*Minghui Sun,Benjamin A. Goldstein,Matthew M. Engelhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLEAR, a framework for learning task-relevant representations unaffected by superficial characteristics to ensure equitable and generalizable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of biases where task-irrelevant superficial characteristics (e.g., race or sex) affect downstream predictions, especially in sensitive applications like healthcare.

Method: CLEAR uses Contrastive Learning with an Anti-contrastive Regularization strategy, applying a Pair-Switching penalty to minimize the mutual information between irrelevant style features and relevant content labels. It is instantiated in a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE).

Result: Experiments with CLEAR-VAE show improved classification performance under mismatched content and style, as well as capabilities to swap and interpolate between content and style features.

Conclusion: CLEAR effectively separates task-relevant features from superficial ones, ensuring better performance and fairness in cases of superficial characteristic shifts. The method is intuitive, easy to implement, and adaptable to multiple datasets.

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

### [159] [Ralts: Robust Aggregation for Enhancing Graph Neural Network Resilience on Bit-flip Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18804)
*Wencheng Zou,Nan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against hardware-induced bit-flip errors and proposes Ralts, a lightweight solution to enhance resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored issue of hardware-induced errors in GNNs, which are becoming more prevalent due to advancements in technology nodes.

Method: Ralts uses graph similarity metrics to filter out outliers, recovers compromised graph topology, and integrates these techniques into aggregation functions compatible with message-passing GNN models.

Result: Ralts improves GNN prediction accuracy significantly: by at least 20% for errors in model weights or node embeddings, and by at least 10% for adjacency matrix errors under a specific bit error rate.

Conclusion: Ralts enhances GNN robustness efficiently, supporting diverse architectures and datasets, while achieving performance comparable to standard PyTorch Geometric functions.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node
embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts
is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

### [160] [Fishers for Free? Approximating the Fisher Information Matrix by Recycling the Squared Gradient Accumulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18807)
*YuXin Li,Felix Dangel,Derek Tam,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "Squisher," a method leveraging squared gradient accumulators from adaptive optimizers to approximate the Fisher diagonal, reducing computational costs. Experiments show its effectiveness across various applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating the Fisher diagonal using traditional methods is computationally expensive, yet it is widely used for measuring parameter sensitivity. Reusing existing calculations, like the squared gradient accumulator in adaptive optimizers, could save computational resources.

Method: The authors propose the 'Squisher' method, which utilizes squared gradient accumulators from adaptive gradient optimizers like Adam as an approximation of the Fisher diagonal. They conduct experiments across five applications to validate the method.

Result: Experimental results show that the Squisher performs similarly to the Fisher diagonal while being computationally cheaper. It also outperforms other baseline methods in these tasks.

Conclusion: The Squisher is an efficient, practical alternative to traditional Fisher diagonal estimation, leveraging existing computations to maintain performance while reducing overhead. The authors also provide insights into the distinct roles of the Squisher and the actual Fisher diagonal.

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

*Marco Bagatella,Mert Albaba,Jonas Hübotter,Georg Martius,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces goal-conditioned test-time training (GC-TTT), which adapts offline RL policies to specific evaluation goals by fine-tuning with relevant data during test time, leading to significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to enhance offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning by leveraging ideas from foundation models, which improve performance via test-time specialization for specific tasks.

Method: The paper proposes GC-TTT, using a novel self-supervised data selection to identify relevant transitions for fine-tuning the policy during test time in a receding-horizon format.

Result: Experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements across loco-navigation and manipulation tasks using GC-TTT, compared to standard offline RL pre-training.

Conclusion: GC-TTT enhances offline RL by adapting policies to specific goals dynamically during test time, achieving better performance without increasing computational costs.

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

*Maksymilian Wojnar*

TL;DR: The paper develops fast and accurate generative models using Flow Matching (FM) for simulating zero degree calorimeters in the ALICE experiment, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing computational demands in high-energy physics simulations necessitate more efficient techniques. Generative neural networks, like FM, promise high-fidelity results with reduced computational overhead.

Method: Flow Matching (FM) is employed to train surrogate models for simulating zero degree calorimeters. An effective training strategy is introduced, and both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors are simulated with a focus on accuracy and computational efficiency.

Result: The FM model demonstrates superior fidelity and computational efficiency for ZN and ZP simulations. A Wasserstein distance of 1.27 is achieved for ZN simulations with a dramatically reduced inference time of 0.46 ms (0.026 ms in latent FM model). Similarly, ZP simulations achieve a Wasserstein distance of 1.30, outperforming the previous best.

Conclusion: The use of FM in HEP simulations offers a substantial improvement in both speed and accuracy. This advancement will help meet the computational challenges faced by research institutions. The results set a new benchmark for simulation fidelity and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

*Zongyi Li,Samuel Lanthaler,Catherine Deng,Michael Chen,Yixuan Wang,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a scale-informed neural operator model with a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of PDEs, improving generalization to a broader range of scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models for solving PDEs often lack generalization and fail to work across varying parameters, such as different Reynolds numbers ($Re$).

Method: They propose a scale-consistency loss and leverage re-scaling properties of PDEs. This is combined with a neural operator capable of handling multiple scales and resolutions.

Result: Their model generalizes from a Reynolds number of 1000 to a range of 250 to 10000, achieving a 34% average error reduction across datasets compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates better generalization capabilities in solving PDEs, highlighting the importance of incorporating scale-consistency in training neural PDE solvers.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance decision-making in strong models through weak-to-strong generalization, incorporating both success and failure learning using trajectory trees and Monte Carlo Tree Search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable strong models to leverage both successful and failed trajectories from weak models, improving their capabilities in complex interactive decision-making environments.

Method: Fine-tuning strong models with intermediate action trajectories from weak models, organizing these trajectories into hierarchical 'trajectory trees,' and optimizing them using Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Result: The method demonstrates significant improvement in reasoning and decision-making abilities across various tasks, showing its scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively advances the field of weak-to-strong generalization, providing theoretical guarantees and practical outcomes. It enriches strong models with comprehensive learning experiences from weak models.

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

### [165] [Early Mortality Prediction in ICU Patients with Hypertensive Kidney Disease Using Interpretable Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18866)
*Yong Si,Junyi Fan,Li Sun,Shuheng Chen,Minoo Ahmadi,Elham Pishgar,Kamiar Alaei,Greg Placencia,Maryam Pishgar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a machine learning approach for predicting 30-day mortality in ICU patients with hypertensive kidney disease using clinical data, achieving robust and interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of tailored risk prediction tools for ICU patients with hypertensive kidney disease, focusing on improving mortality prediction for clinical decision-making.

Method: The study developed a machine learning pipeline using early clinical data from the MIMIC-IV database, employed CatBoost as the optimal model, and utilized tools like SHAP values and ALE plots for interpretation.

Result: The CatBoost model achieved an AUROC of 0.88, along with notable sensitivity (0.811) and specificity (0.798), relying on key predictors like consciousness level and coagulation status.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning model offers interpretable and reliable predictive capabilities, assisting clinicians in individualized triage decisions, and is poised for broader validation in critical care settings.

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

*Xuefei Wu,Xiao Yin,Yuanyang Zhu,Chunlin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework, LIGHT, for multi-agent reinforcement learning that leverages human expertise to guide agents with individual intrinsic rewards, showing better performance and reusability on sparse-reward tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of manually engineered reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning, which struggle in sparse-reward environments and lack robust generalization capabilities.

Method: The authors propose LIGHT, a framework that integrates human expertise into MARL in an end-to-end approach. It combines human knowledge and individual action distribution to design intrinsic rewards based on a representational transformation relevant to Q-learning.

Result: The experiments reveal that LIGHT outperforms existing methods in both learning performance and the ability to reuse knowledge across different tasks in sparse-reward environments.

Conclusion: The LIGHT framework demonstrates its potential to enhance MARL algorithms by effectively leveraging human expertise for improved exploration, learning, and generalization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes GMC-MPNN, a new graph neural network approach that incorporates 3D geometric features and long-range interactions for better blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to improve the prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP), which is crucial for developing drugs targeting the central nervous system. Existing GNNs do not incorporate 3D spatial geometry, which is important for accurately modeling drug transport mechanisms.

Method: The paper introduces Geometric Multi-Color Message-Passing Graph Neural Network (GMC-MPNN), a novel GNN that creates weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types and incorporates atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. The model was evaluated using scaffold-based splitting on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks.

Result: GMC-MPNN outperformed state-of-the-art models in BBBP prediction tasks, achieving AUC-ROC scores of 0.9704 and 0.9685 for classification, RMSE of 0.4609, and Pearson correlation of 0.7759 for regression. Ablation studies confirmed the significance of specific atom-pair interactions in improving predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: By incorporating 3D spatial geometry and capturing chemically significant interactions, GMC-MPNN delivers a more accurate and generalizable framework for BBBP prediction, setting a new benchmark in the drug discovery process.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

*Asaf Cohen,Onur Günlü*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of identifying the best arm in stochastic linear bandits while preventing an external observer from identifying the best arm, proposing a coded arm strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing a method to identify the best arm in stochastic linear bandits while securing this information from an external observer, avoiding reliance on traditional cryptographic tools.

Method: The paper designs an algorithm using coded arms, which strategically manipulates the arm pulls to obscure the best arm from an observer while maintaining performance.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves an error exponent of $\Omega(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)})$, comparable to a secure baseline, while revealing minimal information to the observer.

Conclusion: The secure coded-arm algorithm balances best arm identification efficiency with protection against information leakage to an observer, offering a novel solution without cryptographic primitives.

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KASPER, a novel framework for stock prediction using regime detection and symbolic rule extraction, achieving better outcomes than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors address the challenge that traditional deep learning models face in financial forecasting due to nonlinear and regime-dependent market dynamics, aiming for a more adaptive and interpretable model.

Method: They propose the KASPER framework, employing regime detection via a Gumbel-Softmax mechanism, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations, and symbolic learning using Monte Carlo Shapley values.

Result: KASPER was tested on Yahoo Finance data, achieving an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, surpassing traditional models.

Conclusion: The research establishes a framework for regime-aware and interpretable financial market forecasting, advancing the potential of machine learning in this domain.

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,
transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.

TL;DR: This study introduces machine learning and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) frameworks for predicting differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) recurrence, achieving high accuracy and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for accurate, interpretable DTC recurrence models with uncertainty awareness to aid in better clinical decision-making.

Method: Comparison of initial ML models, feature selection with Boruta algorithm, and application of BNNs using varying mathematical priors on datasets.

Result: BNN with Normal 0,10 prior showed maximum accuracy levels: 0.9870 after feature selection and 0.9740 before feature selection.

Conclusion: Incorporating feature selection and BNNs enhances both accuracy and uncertainty handling, improving prediction frameworks for DTC recurrence.

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,
respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning is challenged by delayed feedback, especially with random delays, and this paper seeks to develop a novel method to address them effectively.

Method: The proposed method introduces the 'conservative agent,' which converts random-delay environments into constant-delay equivalents, enabling seamless application of existing methods.

Result: The proposed agent demonstrated significant improvements in continuous control tasks over baseline methods in terms of performance and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The study illustrates that the conservative agent mechanism can extend state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods to random-delay environments without compromising on performance or requiring major structural changes.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed,Nouman Muhammad Durrani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FADE, a robust learning framework for sequential covariate shifts in dynamic environments, achieving significant accuracy improvements and generalizing to federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of machine learning systems operating under dynamically evolving input distributions (sequential covariate shift) while maintaining performance.

Method: The proposed approach, FADE, uses Fisher information-guided regularization and a Cramer-Rao-informed signal for shift detection. It operates online without task boundaries, target supervision, or replay mechanisms.

Result: FADE outperforms existing methods like TENT and DIW with up to 19% higher accuracy across benchmarks spanning vision, language, and tabular data. Also, it naturally extends to federated learning.

Conclusion: FADE is effective and scalable for robust adaptation in sequential covariate shifts, with theoretical guarantees on performance and practical success across diverse modalities.

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

*Gihun Kim,Sun-Yong Choi,Yeoneung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new diffusion-based generative approach for financial time series by embedding geometric Brownian motion (GBM) into the noise injection process and training it using a Transformer-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to improve the realism of generative models for financial time series, addressing the unique heteroskedasticity and statistical properties of financial data such as heavy-tailed distributions and volatility clustering.

Method: The proposed method incorporates GBM in the forward noising process, injects price-proportional noise, and utilizes a Transformer-based architecture for training via denoising score matching.

Result: Empirical tests on historical stock data show the model better replicates stylized facts like heavy-tailed returns, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect compared to existing diffusion models.

Conclusion: The integration of GBM into the generative framework enhances the model's ability to generate realistic financial time series, providing a significant improvement over conventional approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

TL;DR: MindSpeed RL is a new reinforcement learning training system that focuses on improving efficiency and scalability in large-scale RL tasks. It introduces innovative strategies to reduce overhead and optimize memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aimed to address the challenges of poor scalability and low memory utilization in RL training systems, especially under heavy cross-node dependencies.

Method: MindSpeed RL reorganizes RL data dependencies with distributed strategies, introduces a distributed transfer dock strategy for dispatch optimization, and a practical allgather-swap strategy to reduce memory overhead. Additionally, it applies various parallelization and acceleration techniques.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B showed throughput increases of 1.42 to 3.97 times compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: MindSpeed RL is an effective and efficient system for large-scale RL training, demonstrating significant improvements in throughput and reliability. The open-sourcing of the system further validates its utility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNN-to-MLP methods accelerate Graph Neural Networks by distilling their knowledge into simpler MLPs. The authors propose ProGMLP to dynamically balance inference cost and accuracy using progressive techniques, validated on eight datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-to-MLP methods enhance computational efficiency but lack flexibility to adapt to varying computational costs and runtime constraints.

Method: The authors introduce ProGMLP, employing a Progressive Training Structure for sequential MLP training, Progressive Knowledge Distillation to refine this process, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation to improve generalization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph datasets show ProGMLP achieves high accuracy while adapting dynamically to runtime constraints.

Conclusion: ProGMLP provides a flexible, accurate, and efficient method for deploying GNN-to-MLP models in resource-constrained and varying runtime scenarios.

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

### [176] [Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Learning and Extrapolating System Dynamics Across Bifurcations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19036)
*Eva van Tegelen,George van Voorn,Ioannis Athanasiadis,Peter van Heijster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) for learning and forecasting both local and global bifurcations in dynamical systems from timeseries data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting shifts in dynamical systems focus on discrete-time approaches and local bifurcations, leaving room for improvement in addressing continuous dynamics and global bifurcations.

Method: The researchers used Neural ODEs as a continuous, data-driven method to learn system dynamics and bifurcation structures from timeseries data, applying the approach to a predator-prey model.

Result: Neural ODEs effectively learned parameter-dependent vector fields, recovering bifurcation structures and accurately forecasting bifurcations beyond the training data's parameter range.

Conclusion: Neural ODEs exhibit strong forecasting capabilities for bifurcations even under noise or limited datasets, highlighting the significance of data quality rather than quantity.

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

### [177] [Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing with Visibility Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19046)
*Charlotte Geier,Merten Stender*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC), using the visibility graph method to create more predictive and efficient reservoir networks tailored to specific time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prediction of nonlinear time series is difficult, and conventional reservoir computing methods relying on random graph architectures can lead to inefficient and poorly performing networks.

Method: The paper proposes the DyRC framework, employing visibility graphs to convert time series input into an informed reservoir network structure without the need for hyperparameter tuning.

Result: The DyRC-VG framework demonstrated improved prediction accuracy and consistency compared to similarly sized random network architectures in tasks like the Duffing oscillator.

Conclusion: Dynamics-informed reservoir structures like DyRC-VG can enhance prediction tasks, showcasing superior adaptability and efficiency over traditional random architectures.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

*Lindsay A. Rutter,Abhishek Sharma,Ian Seet,David Obeh Alobo,An Goto,Leroy Cronin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents molecular assembly as a novel, interpretable, and measurable approach for detecting life in astrobiology using mass spectrometry data, supported by a machine learning model for enhancing prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an unbiased method for detecting life in the Solar System that doesn't rely on terrestrial assumptions and can utilize mass spectrometry data for direct application in space missions.

Method: The authors propose using molecular assembly, which reflects how molecules bond and evolve, and developed a machine learning model to predict molecular assembly from mass spectrometry data with high accuracy.

Result: The model demonstrated a three-fold reduction in error over baseline models. However, minor instrumental inconsistencies were found to significantly affect prediction accuracy, highlighting the necessity for standardized mass spectrometry data.

Conclusion: Molecular assembly, combined with standardized mass spectrometry databases and machine learning, provides a viable framework for life detection in future astrobiology missions, offering direct, interpretable, and measurable insights.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

*Mulin Chen,Bocheng Wang,Jiaxin Zhong,Zongcheng Miao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the CGIR model, addressing attribute-missing graph clustering by using subcluster distributions and a new edge attention network for improved imputation and embedding refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for attribute-missing graph clustering fail to effectively capture class-relevant semantic information during imputation, and they overlook that some attributes are not correlated with the graph during refinement.

Method: The CGIR model estimates subcluster distributions to guide a generative adversarial module for better attribute imputation and uses an edge attention network to focus on edge-relevant attributes, improving clustering results.

Result: The CGIR model demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: By splitting the clustering task into subcluster search and mergence, and integrating imputation and refinement into a unified framework, CGIR offers a more effective solution for attribute-missing graph clustering.

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clustering attributed graphs are challenging due to graph complexity and heterogeneity in node attributes, necessitating improved methods for better representation and clustering.

Method: The proposed GCL-GCN model includes a Graphormer module for capturing global and local node information and a contrastive learning module for pre-training, enhancing discriminative feature power before clustering.

Result: GCL-GCN outperformed 14 advanced methods on six datasets, showing significant improvements in clustering metrics such as ACC, NMI, and ARI, particularly excelling on the Cora dataset.

Conclusion: GCL-GCN effectively addresses the challenges of attributed graph clustering by enhancing node representations and feature discrimination, setting a new benchmark in clustering quality and robustness.

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) methods, which often struggle to balance privacy and utility, especially when data publishers and users are distinct.

Method: Introduces a privacy-preserving graph estimation method using Gaussian Differential Privacy with structured noise injection, focusing on unbiased recovery at the data publishing stage.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates robust performance and ensures theoretical accuracy in graph recovery, including scenarios involving discrete-variable graphs.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical and privacy-conscious solution for graph analysis while addressing underexplored aspects of differential privacy at the data publishing stage.

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PVAL framework, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic panels in satellite imagery, addressing major challenges in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving solar PV panel detection is important for optimizing renewable energy systems and addressing the limitations of existing methods, such as lack of algorithmic transparency, poor generalization, and reliance on high-quality training data.

Method: The proposed PVAL framework combines task decomposition, output standardization, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning with curated PV datasets to improve LLM accuracy in solar panel detection.

Result: PVAL enhances detection accuracy, generalizability, and scalability while reducing computational overhead and improving transparency in solar PV panel detection workflows.

Conclusion: The PVAL framework facilitates large-scale renewable energy integration and optimized grid management by providing an automated, transparent, and reproducible solution for solar panel detection.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

*Chi-Ching Hsu,Gaëtan Frusque,Florent Forest,Felipe Macedo,Christian M. Franck,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised framework for monitoring high-voltage circuit breakers (CBs) using vibration and acoustic signals, addressing challenges where fault labels are unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CB monitoring relies on physical parameters and supervised methods that require pre-defined fault labels or laboratory conditions, which are impractical in real-world scenarios. There is a need for online, non-intrusive, and unsupervised monitoring techniques.

Method: The paper introduces an unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that uses healthy CB data for training. It incorporates XAI methods to provide explainable diagnostics based on vibrations and acoustic signals, without requiring labeled fault data.

Result: The framework was tested using experimental data from CBs under both healthy and artificially induced fault conditions, demonstrating its capability to detect and differentiate faults.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables online, unsupervised monitoring of CBs, paving the way for more reliable operations by providing meaningful fault diagnostics without relying on ground-truth fault labels.

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

TL;DR: This paper explores automatic cough analysis for early NSCLC detection using machine learning and deep learning methods, achieving an 83% accuracy with CNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve early NSCLC diagnosis using non-invasive and practical methods, such as cough analysis.

Method: The study employs machine learning (SVM, XGBoost) and deep learning (CNN, transfer learning with VGG16), supplemented by SHAP for interpretability and fairness assessments across age and gender.

Result: CNN achieved the highest performance (accuracy: 0.83), while SVM offered competitive results with lower computational requirements. Fairness analysis revealed disparities across age and gender.

Conclusion: Automatic cough analysis shows promise as a pre-screening tool for NSCLC, but larger and more diverse clinical datasets are needed to validate findings.

Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for
improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Weakness-Aware Channel Attention (WACA) mechanism for improving IR drop prediction in VLSI layout analysis, significantly outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the computational inefficiency and lack of scalability in traditional simulation methods for predicting IR drop in VLSI design.

Method: The authors propose a pixel-wise regression task leveraging multi-channel physical maps from layouts, coupled with a WACA mechanism within a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net to balance and enhance feature representation.

Result: The proposed method outperformed the ICCAD-2023 contest winner, reducing mean absolute error by 61.1% and improving the F1-score by 71.0%.

Conclusion: Channel-wise heterogeneity is a crucial inductive bias in VLSI physical layout analysis, and the WACA mechanism proves effective for such tasks.

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

*Md Abrar Jahin,Shahriar Soudeep,M. F. Mridha,Muhammad Mostafa Monowar,Md. Abdul Hamid*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy physics. By using domain-specific graph structures and loss functions, the method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the inefficiencies of static machine learning models and generic GNNs in high-energy physics $p_T$ estimation, especially under high pileup conditions and resource constraints.

Method: The authors introduced tailored graph construction strategies emphasizing detector geometry and physical observables, integrated with specialized Message Passing Layers featuring attention mechanisms and domain-specific loss functions.

Result: The proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly fewer parameters compared to baselines, validated on the CMS Trigger Dataset.

Conclusion: Physics-informed GNNs offer a promising approach for deployment in real-time resource-constrained trigger systems in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

*Chaithra Umesh,Kristian Schultz,Manjunath Mahendra,Saptarshi Bej,Olaf Wolkenhauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of preserving functional and logical dependencies in synthetic tabular data generation by proposing the Hierarchical Feature Generation Framework (HFGF).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a research gap in generative models' ability to retain deterministic and rule-based associations, such as functional dependencies (FDs) and logical dependencies (LDs), in synthetic tabular datasets.

Method: The HFGF first generates independent features using standard generative models and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD rules.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying complexity showed that HFGF significantly improves the preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN, TVAE, and GReaT.

Conclusion: HFGF enhances the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data, addressing a significant issue in existing generative models.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a machine learning approach to improve indoor airflow and temperature prediction by using a surrogate model to replace computationally expensive CFD simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD simulations for indoor airflow prediction are computationally intensive, hindering their application in real-time and iterative design workflows.

Method: The study uses a component-based machine learning approach involving three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder, an MLP, and a CNN, applied to a two-dimensional room scenario with variable air velocities.

Result: The proposed CBML model accurately and efficiently predicts aggregated velocity and temperature fields in both training and testing datasets.

Conclusion: This approach demonstrates the potential of using CBML surrogate models for faster and reliable predictions to optimize building energy use and occupant comfort.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

### [189] [A Markov Categorical Framework for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19247)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a theoretical framework using Markov Categories to analyze the auto-regressive generation process and the NLL training objective of language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a deeper theoretical understanding of why minimizing the negative log-likelihood objective yields versatile representations in auto-regressive language models.

Method: The paper models the single-step generation process as compositions of Markov kernels enriched with statistical divergences to analyze information flow and learned geometry.

Result: Three main contributions: explaining the success of speculative decoding methods like EAGLE, formalizing how NLL trains models to capture stochasticity via categorical entropy, and proving NLL training as a form of implicit spectral contrastive learning.

Conclusion: The framework offers insights into the structured geometric principles behind modern language model effectiveness and sheds light on their learned representation spaces.

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

*Shuo Yang,Zheyu Zhang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPADA, a method for tabular data augmentation that addresses limitations of current large language model approaches, namely dependency-biased modeling and high computational costs, offering faster, lightweight data generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of high-quality tabular data caused by privacy concerns and collection costs, and the limitations of current LLM-based augmentation methods in terms of bias and inefficiency.

Method: SPADA uses a graph-based approach where each feature is treated as a node, and values are synthesized by conditioning only on parent nodes in the sparsely connected graph. It employs two strategies: Gaussian kernel density estimation and conditional normalizing flows for density estimation.

Result: SPADA improves data quality by reducing constraint violations by 4% and offers 9,500x faster data generation compared to LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: SPADA provides an efficient and effective framework for augmenting tabular data while overcoming dependency-related biases and computational inefficiencies of current LLM-based methods.

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

*Andrii Dzhoha,Katya Mirylenka,Egor Malykh,Marco-Andrea Buchmann,Francesca Catino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of introducing short-form video experiences in platforms like e-commerce and proposes using a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language model for better video recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing popularity of short-form video content and its expansion into non-traditional domains such as e-commerce, while overcoming challenges like position bias, duration bias, and limited interaction data in recommender systems.

Method: The authors propose leveraging a fine-tuned multimodal vision-language retrieval model instead of traditional supervised learning methods for recommending short-form videos.

Result: The proposed vision-language model outperformed conventional supervised learning methods in online experiments conducted on their e-commerce platform.

Conclusion: Employing a multimodal vision-language approach offers a more effective solution to the challenges of recommending short-form video content in immersive feed experiences compared to traditional supervised methods.

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel method using GENEOs for efficient SINR map reconstruction in 6G networks from sparse data samples, achieving competitive performance under severe limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient resource management in 6G networks requires high-resolution SINR maps, which are costly to acquire. This paper seeks ways to reconstruct these maps from sparse data.

Method: It introduces a GENEO-based approach, leveraging invariances to reduce complexity and enforce constraints reflecting symmetries, aiding reconstruction from limited data.

Result: The proposed GENEO-based framework achieves competitive performance compared to traditional methods in reconstructing spatial signals with sparse data.

Conclusion: GENEOs provide an effective, low-complexity solution for SINR map reconstruction, demonstrating advantages in handling severe data limitations.

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a model-specific optimization approach using sum-product networks (SPNs) integrated with variational autoencoders (VAEs) to improve counterfactual explanations for deep learning models in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to enhance the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models used in impactful decision-making tasks, particularly in medical image analysis, motivates this research. Counterfactual explanations offer promise, but generating plausible and human-interpretable counterfactuals remains a key challenge.

Method: The authors propose combining the latent space of semi-supervised VAEs with SPNs. This integration helps describe and classify the latent space for optimizing counterfactuals that preserve data distribution while aligning with target class distribution.

Result: Experimental evaluations on the cheXpert dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SPN-guided latent space manipulations compared to a neural network baseline. The study also assesses the trade-offs between latent variable regularization and the quality of counterfactual explanations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating SPNs into the latent space optimization process enhances counterfactual explanations and reliability in decision-making tasks for medical applications.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges posed by the growing complexity and volume of financial transactions to traditional fraud detection systems.

Method: Developed behavioral feature engineering for data transformation, tested classical models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.) against quantum models (e.g., QSVM) using the IBM AML dataset, and proposed a hybrid API-driven architecture (FD4QC).

Result: Classical models, particularly Random Forest, outperformed quantum ones with 97.34% accuracy, while QSVM emerged as the most promising quantum model but has computational limitations.

Conclusion: Classical models remain more effective than current quantum approaches for fraud detection, though quantum methods hold potential for future improvements.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the issue of predictive multiplicity in machine learning models for medical tasks and proposes strategies to mitigate it through ensemble methods and abstention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of predictive multiplicity in medical machine learning models, where equally valid models can produce conflicting predictions, posing reliability challenges in clinical settings.

Method: The authors analyze predictive multiplicity empirically across various medical tasks and model architectures, study its drivers and ramifications, and propose using small ensembles with abstention strategies to mitigate its effects.

Result: The study finds that commonly used validation metrics fail to identify a singular optimal model, and predictions often depend on arbitrary development choices. Small ensembles paired with abstention strategies significantly reduce predictive multiplicity, especially when model accuracy is improved through greater capacity.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of addressing predictive multiplicity in medical ML models and argues for ensemble-based approaches to enhance diagnostic consistency and reliability, recommending expert reviews for cases where consensus is insufficient.

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

*Ali RajabiNekoo,Laleh Rasoul,Amirfarhad Farhadi,Azadeh Zamanifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The SILS framework revolutionizes liquidity analysis in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) by shifting from traditional static measures to a dynamic, impact-centered approach, leveraging advanced metrics and tools to accurately assess Liquidity Providers' (LPs) influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying impactful LPs in CLMMs are inadequate, as they rely on broad or superficial metrics, leading to inaccurate risk analysis and market inefficiencies.

Method: SILS uses on-chain event logs, smart contract execution traces, Exponential Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles, unsupervised anomaly detection, and the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric to assess LPs' functional importance.

Result: The framework offers a more detailed and accurate identification of high-impact LPs, avoiding false positives and negatives inherent in traditional methods, and enables new applications like protective oracle layers and actionable trader signals.

Conclusion: SILS transforms the risk management approach in DeFi, providing transparency, reducing risks, and enhancing stability by effectively identifying and assessing the functional importance of LPs.

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

TL;DR: Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM, introduces hardware-optimized decoding innovations, outperforming peers like DeepSeek-V3 in cost and speed for long-context reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hardware inefficiency during decoding, especially in long-context reasoning tasks, leading to a need for better cost-efficient designs.

Method: Step-3 employs Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) to reduce computational load and cache size, and Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD) to separate subsystems for distributed processing.

Result: Step-3 reduces theoretical decoding costs significantly while sustaining high parameter activation (38B per token) and achieves faster decoding throughput (4,039 tokens/sec) on Hopper GPUs compared to peers like DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: Step-3 sets a new efficiency standard for long-context decoding, validating the importance of hardware-aware innovations like MFA and AFD in achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324
in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

### [199] [Observations Meet Actions: Learning Control-Sufficient Representations for Robust Policy Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19437)
*Yuliang Gu,Hongpeng Cao,Marco Caccamo,Naira Hovakimyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bottlenecked Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), a method for enhancing RL in varying contexts by optimizing a contextual evidence lower bound (ELBO). It surpasses baselines in standard tasks and adapts well beyond the training regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many reinforcement-learning agents struggle to generalize beyond their training environments due to latent variations in contexts. Addressing this limitation is critical for broader applicability.

Method: The paper introduces BCPO, an algorithm incorporating a variational information-bottleneck encoder that separates representation learning from policy learning. It maximizes an ELBO-style objective and integrates with off-policy RL learners.

Result: BCPO efficiently handles latent context variations, using fewer samples than baselines, matching or exceeding performance and maintaining effectiveness even outside the training regime.

Conclusion: This framework bridges theory and practice by formalizing context-based RL properties and demonstrating practical improvements in adaptive RL scenarios.

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A position paper highlights recent progress in developing and training large-scale event forecasting LLMs to reach superforecaster-level performance. It proposes solutions to significant challenges and novel data collection approaches for improved predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early skepticism about LLMs in event forecasting has been mitigated by recent advances in reasoning models and evaluation methods, indicating a timely opportunity to train superforecaster-level systems.

Method: This study identifies challenges, recommends solutions (e.g., hypothetical Bayesian networks, counterfactual events, auxiliary rewards), and proposes large-scale data integration for model improvement.

Result: State-of-the-art methods and datasets have shown promise in moving towards superforecaster-level LLMs, with reinforcement learning and reasoning techniques boosting performance.

Conclusion: Further research into training models at scale, overcoming specific challenges, and implementing innovative data strategies could lead to transformative AI-driven forecasting capabilities for society.

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

*Lisa Barros de Andrade e Sousa,Gregor Miller,Ronan Le Gleut,Dominik Thalmeier,Helena Pelin,Marie Piraud*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a technique to enhance the interpretability of Random Forests (RF) by clustering data points based on their shared decision paths, with applications in identifying meaningful patterns in datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for interpretable machine learning models is growing, especially for sensitive applications, but Random Forest models are difficult to interpret due to their ensemble nature.

Method: The authors propose Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), which uses shared decision paths in RFs to form clusters of data points and produces feature importance scores for each cluster and as a whole.

Result: FGC recovered latent subclass structures on benchmark datasets, outperformed traditional clustering and explainability methods, and identified biologically coherent subpopulations and novel gene patterns on an AML transcriptomic dataset.

Conclusion: FGC successfully combines model interpretability with performance, offering insights into both global and local decision-making structures in RFs while providing actionable insights beyond simple feature attribution.

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application
areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.

*Maria Zaitseva,Ivan Tomilov,Natalia Gusarova*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'gradient dropout,' modifying backpropagation to improve noise robustness in feed-forward neural networks, analyzed via game theory. Outcome varies by dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feed-forward neural networks are vulnerable to input noise, affecting their prediction performance.

Method: The authors propose 'gradient dropout,' where neuron gradients are selectively nullified during backpropagation, along with target variable noising. This is framed in the context of compositional game theory.

Result: Experiments on ten datasets showed diverse impacts, including increased robustness with certain configurations, particularly in regression tasks.

Conclusion: The method shows potential to improve robustness, underscores the importance of parameter tuning, and presents new analytical avenues using game-theoretic concepts.

Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing
prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often
alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to
enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a
multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our
"gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with
probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active.
This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables
were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten
diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of
robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on
regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution
target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by
flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the
method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning,
and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems
exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rust's use of high-level abstractions, optimizations, and rich type system complicates decompilation efforts.

Method: A benchmark-driven evaluation using an automated scoring framework to assess decompilation quality and case studies for analyzing constructs.

Result: Language constructs like generics, trait methods, and error handling significantly impede decompilation quality, especially in release builds.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for Rust-aware strategies to improve decompilation and provide actionable guidance for tool developers.

Abstract: Decompiling Rust binaries is challenging due to the language's rich type
system, aggressive compiler optimizations, and widespread use of high-level
abstractions. In this work, we conduct a benchmark-driven evaluation of
decompilation quality across core Rust features and compiler build modes. Our
automated scoring framework shows that generic types, trait methods, and error
handling constructs significantly reduce decompilation quality, especially in
release builds. Through representative case studies, we analyze how specific
language constructs affect control flow, variable naming, and type information
recovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for tool developers and
highlight the need for Rust-aware decompilation strategies.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MiniLang, a redesigned proof language for Isabelle/HOL, significantly boosting the success of LLMs in theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce labor and computation costs in proof engineering by leveraging neural theorem proving with improved representations for LLMs.

Method: The authors designed MiniLang, an optimized proof language for Isabelle/HOL, and tested it with fine-tuned LLMs incorporating an enhanced Sledgehammer.

Result: MiniLang improved LLM success rates on the PISA benchmark by up to 29%, with pass@1 reaching 69.1% and pass@8 achieving 79.2%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Redesigning proof language representations, like MiniLang, effectively enhances LLM-based theorem proving, setting new performance standards.

Abstract: Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) employs deep learning methods, particularly
Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate formal proofs in proof assistants.
This approach holds promise for reducing the dramatic labor costs or
computation costs required in proof engineering, which is fundamental to formal
verification and other software engineering methods. The paper explores the
potential of improving NTP by redesigning the proof language, given that LLMs'
capabilities depend highly on representations. We introduce \emph{MiniLang}, a
redesigned proof language for Isabelle/HOL incorporating an improved version of
Sledgehammer. Experiments show MiniLang benefits two fine-tuned LLMs by
improving the success rate on the PISA benchmark by up to 29\% in comparison to
generation of Isar proof script. The success rate under one attempt (so-called
\emph{pass@1}) reaches 69.1\%, exceeding the previous Baldur's pass@64
(65.7\%); The pass@8 reaches 79.2\%, exceeding the state-of-the-art on PISA

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an approach using ACL2s to reason about Python code, including generating inputs for fuzzing and identifying bugs in Python programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in Python type checkers by leveraging ACL2s to reason about and improve Python code reliability.

Method: They developed an embedding of a subset of the Python type system within ACL2s, enabling type-specific fuzzing to detect bugs missed by type checkers.

Result: The approach achieved 68%-80% code coverage in fuzzing functions from four open-source Python repositories and identified patterns limiting coverage like complex branch conditions.

Conclusion: The embedding shows potential for improving Python code verification, though challenges like complex code patterns and external dependencies remain for future work.

Abstract: Python is a high-level interpreted language that has become an industry
standard in a wide variety of applications. In this paper, we take a first step
towards using ACL2s to reason about Python code by developing an embedding of a
subset of the Python type system in ACL2s. The subset of Python types we
support includes many of the most commonly used type annotations as well as
user-defined types comprised of supported types. We provide ACL2s definitions
of these types, as well as defdata enumerators that are customized to provide
code coverage and identify errors in Python programs. Using the ACL2s
embedding, we can generate instances of types that can then be used as inputs
to fuzz Python programs, which allows us to identify bugs in Python code that
are not detected by state-of-the-art Python type checkers. We evaluate our work
against four open-source repositories, extracting their type information and
generating inputs for fuzzing functions with type signatures that are in the
supported subset of Python types. Note that we only use the type signatures of
functions to generate inputs and treat the bodies of functions as black boxes.
We measure code coverage, which ranges from about 68% to more than 80%, and
identify code patterns that hinder coverage such as complex branch conditions
and external file system dependencies. We conclude with a discussion of the
results and recommendations for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust framework for guaranteed runtime efficiency and termination in program verification, eliminating ad hoc solutions.

Method: Developing a programming language with a static type system designed to enforce a polynomial-time equivalence property, and providing theoretical and practical demonstrations.

Result: Proven theoretical equivalence of polynomial-time solvability and definability in the language, alongside the development of an interpreter to validate practical feasibility.

Conclusion: The proposed language offers a formal, verified foundation for feasible computations, ensuring both theoretical soundness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Runtime efficiency and termination are crucial properties in the studies of
program verification. Instead of dealing with these issues in an ad hoc manner,
it would be useful to develop a robust framework in which such properties are
guaranteed by design. This paper introduces a new imperative programming
language whose design is grounded in a static type system that ensures the
following equivalence property: All definable programs are guaranteed to run in
polynomial time; Conversely, all problems solvable in polynomial time can be
solved by some programs of the language. The contribution of this work is
twofold. On the theoretical side, the foundational equivalence property is
established, and the proof of the equivalence theorem is non-trivial. On the
practical side, a programming approach is proposed that can streamline program
analysis and verification for feasible computations. An interpreter for the
language has been implemented, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach in
practice.

*Miguel Saavedra-Ruiz,Samer B. Nashed,Charlie Gauthier,Liam Paull*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perpetua, a method for dynamically modeling semi-static features in complex environments, enabling future state predictions and offering advancements over traditional filtering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic systems often operate in changing environments where traditional algorithms fail to predict feature dynamics, prompting the need for a method to model and anticipate changes over time.

Method: Perpetua uses Bayesian frameworks by chaining persistence and emergence filters, incorporating prior knowledge, tracking hypotheses, and adapting to new data to predict the dynamic states of features.

Result: Experiments show Perpetua achieves higher accuracy compared to similar methods, showcasing adaptability and robustness even when dealing with missing observations.

Conclusion: Perpetua is a scalable, efficient, and generalizable method for predicting environmental feature states dynamically, making it promising for extended robotic deployments.

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GLR algorithm outperforms existing methods for collision risk estimation in high-speed racing, achieving significantly reduced errors and high computation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for collision risk estimation in autonomous racing are too simplified or excessively conservative, limiting precision and efficiency in wheel-to-wheel high-speed scenarios.

Method: The GLR algorithm combines Gauss-Legendre integration with a non-homogeneous Poisson process to estimate collision risks, considering geometry and trajectory uncertainty.

Result: In 446 Formula One racing simulations, GLR reduced error by 77% on average and outperformed the next-best baseline method by 52%, operating at 1000 Hz.

Conclusion: GLR provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient collision risk assessment, applicable not only to autonomous racing but to broader motion planning applications.

Abstract: Overtaking in high-speed autonomous racing demands precise, real-time
estimation of collision risk; particularly in wheel-to-wheel scenarios where
safety margins are minimal. Existing methods for collision risk estimation
either rely on simplified geometric approximations, like bounding circles, or
perform Monte Carlo sampling which leads to overly conservative motion planning
behavior at racing speeds. We introduce the Gauss-Legendre Rectangle (GLR)
algorithm, a principled two-stage integration method that estimates collision
risk by combining Gauss-Legendre with a non-homogeneous Poisson process over
time. GLR produces accurate risk estimates that account for vehicle geometry
and trajectory uncertainty. In experiments across 446 overtaking scenarios in a
high-fidelity Formula One racing simulation, GLR outperforms five
state-of-the-art baselines achieving an average error reduction of 77% and
surpassing the next-best method by 52%, all while running at 1000 Hz. The
framework is general and applicable to broader motion planning contexts beyond
autonomous racing.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MetaMorph, a framework for classifying robot morphology, enabling precise comparisons of robot visual features across diverse types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HRI research lacks precise classification methods for robot appearance, which limits understanding of how design influences interaction.

Method: The authors applied a metamodeling approach to analyze the visual morphology of 222 robots listed in the IEEE Robots Guide and developed MetaMorph.

Result: MetaMorph enables structured visual feature comparisons and evaluates visual distances between robots to identify optimal design traits.

Conclusion: MetaMorph offers a systematic tool for better understanding robot appearance and tailoring designs to specific HRI tasks contexts.

Abstract: Robot appearance crucially shapes Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) but is
typically described via broad categories like anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or
technical. More precise approaches focus almost exclusively on anthropomorphic
features, which fail to classify robots across all types, limiting the ability
to draw meaningful connections between robot design and its effect on
interaction. In response, we present MetaMorph, a comprehensive framework for
classifying robot morphology. Using a metamodeling approach, MetaMorph was
synthesized from 222 robots in the IEEE Robots Guide, offering a structured
method for comparing visual features. This model allows researchers to assess
the visual distances between robot models and explore optimal design traits
tailored to different tasks and contexts.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel volumetric grasp model with rotational equivariance, improving sample efficiency and performance. Through a tri-plane volumetric feature design and a deformable steerable convolution, the model enhances computational efficiency and grasp accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address computational inefficiency and the lack of rotational equivariance in existing volumetric grasp models, which limits their effectiveness in robotic grasping tasks.

Method: The paper employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation and introduces a deformable steerable convolution to ensure equivariance and adaptivity to object geometry. It also adapts two existing planners (GIGA and IGD) to be equivariant through new formulations.

Result: The proposed model demonstrates reduced computational and memory costs and outperforms non-equivariant models in simulated and real-world experiments, achieving higher grasp performance.

Conclusion: The integration of equivariant features and optimizations significantly boosts the performance of volumetric grasp models with minimal computational overhead, offering practical advancements in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations
around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample
efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --
i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a
novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are
equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two
planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by
a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of
deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.
This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while
preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations
of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,
we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism
and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow
matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed
equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated
and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory
costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane
features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving
higher performance with only a modest computational overhead. Video and code

*Zheng Yang,Kuan Xu,Shenghai Yuan,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a new, computationally efficient method for estimating robot pose using RGBD-VO by avoiding iterative and feature-based processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RGBD visual odometry methods involve high computational complexity due to iterative optimization and feature extraction, which delays real-time execution.

Method: The paper proposes a decoupled approach that calculates rotation based on planar overlaps and translation using Kernel Cross-Correlation without relying on iterative solvers or feature alignment.

Result: The method achieves a processing speed of 71Hz on a low-end i5 CPU, and performs well in low-texture environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a non-iterative, efficient alternative to traditional methods, enhancing performance in challenging, low-texture settings for robot pose estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for efficiently estimating the
6-Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robot pose with a decoupled, non-iterative method
that capitalizes on overlapping planar elements. Conventional RGB-D visual
odometry(RGBD-VO) often relies on iterative optimization solvers to estimate
pose and involves a process of feature extraction and matching. This results in
significant computational burden and time delays. To address this, our
innovative method for RGBD-VO separates the estimation of rotation and
translation. Initially, we exploit the overlaid planar characteristics within
the scene to calculate the rotation matrix. Following this, we utilize a kernel
cross-correlator (KCC) to ascertain the translation. By sidestepping the
resource-intensive iterative optimization and feature extraction and alignment
procedures, our methodology offers improved computational efficacy, achieving a
performance of 71Hz on a lower-end i5 CPU. When the RGBD-VO does not rely on
feature points, our technique exhibits enhanced performance in low-texture
degenerative environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Asad Ali Shahid,Angelo Moroncelli,Drazen Brscic,Takayuki Kanda,Loris Roveda*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GEAR uses gaze-based input for robots to assist skilled workers in complex assembly tasks, outperforming touchscreen-based approaches in reducing user effort and enhancing experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of enabling human-robot collaboration in complex assembly tasks with inherent variability and precision demands.

Method: GEAR, a gaze-enabled interaction system, was evaluated against a touchscreen interface in two assembly scenarios with 30 participants.

Result: GEAR reduced physical effort, improved user experience, and maintained effective performance, particularly for complex assembly tasks.

Conclusion: Gaze-based human-robot interaction enhances collaboration for complex tasks, demonstrating advantages over traditional touchscreen methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in robot autonomy and safety has significantly improved
human-robot interactions, enabling robots to work alongside humans on various
tasks. However, complex assembly tasks still present significant challenges due
to inherent task variability and the need for precise operations. This work
explores deploying robots in an assistive role for such tasks, where the robot
assists by fetching parts while the skilled worker provides high-level guidance
and performs the assembly. We introduce GEAR, a gaze-enabled system designed to
enhance human-robot collaboration by allowing robots to respond to the user's
gaze. We evaluate GEAR against a touch-based interface where users interact
with the robot through a touchscreen. The experimental study involved 30
participants working on two distinct assembly scenarios of varying complexity.
Results demonstrated that GEAR enabled participants to accomplish the assembly
with reduced physical demand and effort compared to the touchscreen interface,
especially for complex tasks, maintaining great performance, and receiving
objects effectively. Participants also reported enhanced user experience while
performing assembly tasks. Project page: sites.google.com/view/gear-hri

### [213] [Frequency Response Data-Driven Disturbance Observer Design for Flexible Joint Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18979)
*Deokjin Lee,Junho Song,Alireza Karimi,Sehoon Oh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimized disturbance observer for flexible joint robots to improve robustness and motion performance under joint flexibility and parameter variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flexible joint robots face challenges in motion control due to joint elasticity and variations in system dynamics, which limit the effectiveness of disturbance observers.

Method: A novel frequency response function-based optimization method is introduced to design a disturbance observer that maximizes control bandwidth and suppresses vibrations, with stability proven via the Nyquist stability criterion.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates improved robustness and motion performance on flexible joint robots, even with joint flexibility and parameter variations.

Conclusion: The frequency response-based optimization improves disturbance observer design, enhancing control performance and stability for flexible joint robots.

Abstract: Motion control of flexible joint robots (FJR) is challenged by inherent
flexibility and configuration-dependent variations in system dynamics. While
disturbance observers (DOB) can enhance system robustness, their performance is
often limited by the elasticity of the joints and the variations in system
parameters, which leads to a conservative design of the DOB. This paper
presents a novel frequency response function (FRF)-based optimization method
aimed at improving DOB performance, even in the presence of flexibility and
system variability. The proposed method maximizes control bandwidth and
effectively suppresses vibrations, thus enhancing overall system performance.
Closed-loop stability is rigorously proven using the Nyquist stability
criterion. Experimental validation on a FJR demonstrates that the proposed
approach significantly improves robustness and motion performance, even under
conditions of joint flexibility and system variation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study introduces the SmartPNT dataset for advanced navigation research, with data from multiple sensors like GNSS, IMU, cameras, and LiDAR, addressing gaps in sensor diversity and environmental representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for high-quality navigation datasets with diverse sensors and comprehensive environmental scenarios to enhance navigation technologies and test algorithms.

Method: The study developed the SmartPNT dataset by integrating data from various sensors, documenting sensor configurations, and calibrating cameras and LiDAR. It also implemented a standardized framework for data collection and validation using SLAM algorithms.

Result: The dataset was validated using SLAM tools like VINS-Mono and LIO-SAM, proving its suitability for complex, real-world navigation scenarios such as urban areas and tunnels.

Conclusion: The publicly accessible SmartPNT dataset fills existing gaps in navigation research by providing a versatile, high-quality, and diverse resource that promotes innovation in multi-sensor fusion and high-precision navigation fields.

Abstract: High-precision navigation and positioning systems are critical for
applications in autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping, where robust and
continuous localization is essential. To test and enhance the performance of
algorithms, some research institutions and companies have successively
constructed and publicly released datasets. However, existing datasets still
suffer from limitations in sensor diversity and environmental coverage. To
address these shortcomings and advance development in related fields, the
SmartPNT Multisource Integrated Navigation, Positioning, and Attitude Dataset
has been developed. This dataset integrates data from multiple sensors,
including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement
Units (IMU), optical cameras, and LiDAR, to provide a rich and versatile
resource for research in multi-sensor fusion and high-precision navigation. The
dataset construction process is thoroughly documented, encompassing sensor
configurations, coordinate system definitions, and calibration procedures for
both cameras and LiDAR. A standardized framework for data collection and
processing ensures consistency and scalability, enabling large-scale analysis.
Validation using state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms, such as VINS-Mono and LIO-SAM, demonstrates the dataset's
applicability for advanced navigation research. Covering a wide range of
real-world scenarios, including urban areas, campuses, tunnels, and suburban
environments, the dataset offers a valuable tool for advancing navigation
technologies and addressing challenges in complex environments. By providing a
publicly accessible, high-quality dataset, this work aims to bridge gaps in
sensor diversity, data accessibility, and environmental representation,
fostering further innovation in the field.

*Rachel Ringe,Leandra Thiele,Mihai Pomarlan,Nima Zargham,Robin Nolte,Lars Hurrelbrink,Rainer Malaka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study examines how robot design factors influence human interactions in a collaborative cooking task and formulates hypotheses based on participant data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how robot morphology affects human decision-making and interaction in collaborative cooking scenarios.

Method: Participants used a VR environment to set up a kitchen alongside a robot, and multimodal data, think-aloud transcripts, and post-task questionnaires were collected and analyzed.

Result: Hypotheses were derived suggesting a preference for biomorphic robots, differences in perceptions of sensory versus action capabilities, and fewer avoidance strategies with gracile robots.

Conclusion: The study sets the groundwork for testing how morphology influences collaboration with robots, proposing hypotheses for future research.

Abstract: This study explores which factors of the visual design of a robot may
influence how humans would place it in a collaborative cooking scenario and how
these features may influence task delegation. Human participants were placed in
a Virtual Reality (VR) environment and asked to set up a kitchen for cooking
alongside a robot companion while considering the robot's morphology. We
collected multimodal data for the arrangements created by the participants,
transcripts of their think-aloud as they were performing the task, and
transcripts of their answers to structured post-task questionnaires. Based on
analyzing this data, we formulate several hypotheses: humans prefer to
collaborate with biomorphic robots; human beliefs about the sensory
capabilities of robots are less influenced by the morphology of the robot than
beliefs about action capabilities; and humans will implement fewer avoidance
strategies when sharing space with gracile robots. We intend to verify these
hypotheses in follow-up studies.

### [216] [Monocular Vision-Based Swarm Robot Localization Using Equilateral Triangular Formations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19100)
*Taewon Kang,Ji-Wook Kwon,Il Bae,Jin Hyo Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a low-cost localization method for swarm robots using monocular vision sensors and visual markers in open spaces, relying on equilateral triangle geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate localization of swarm robots in real-world applications (e.g., search and rescue) without relying on positioning infrastructures or landmarks, and using only low-cost sensors.

Method: The method uses equilateral triangular formations and the geometric properties of these structures to estimate 2D positions based on one-dimensional lateral distance information obtained through monocular vision sensors.

Result: Experimental and simulation results show that the proposed method has significantly smaller positioning errors over time compared to traditional dead-reckoning methods.

Conclusion: The system is effective for swarm robot localization in open environments with low-cost sensors and outperforms conventional methods in accuracy over time.

Abstract: Localization of mobile robots is crucial for deploying robots in real-world
applications such as search and rescue missions. This work aims to develop an
accurate localization system applicable to swarm robots equipped only with
low-cost monocular vision sensors and visual markers. The system is designed to
operate in fully open spaces, without landmarks or support from positioning
infrastructures. To achieve this, we propose a localization method based on
equilateral triangular formations. By leveraging the geometric properties of
equilateral triangles, the accurate two-dimensional position of each
participating robot is estimated using one-dimensional lateral distance
information between robots, which can be reliably and accurately obtained with
a low-cost monocular vision sensor. Experimental and simulation results
demonstrate that, as travel time increases, the positioning error of the
proposed method becomes significantly smaller than that of a conventional
dead-reckoning system, another low-cost localization approach applicable to
open environments.

### [217] [Diverse and Adaptive Behavior Curriculum for Autonomous Driving: A Student-Teacher Framework with Multi-Agent RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19146)
*Ahmed Abouelazm,Johannes Ratz,Philip Schörner,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an automatic curriculum learning framework for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents in autonomous driving, enhancing their ability to handle diverse traffic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems struggle with navigating complex real-world traffic due to reliance on limited rule-based scenarios for training RL agents, and a lack of focus on balancing routine and critical driving behaviors.

Method: The authors introduce a student-teacher framework, where a graph-based multi-agent RL teacher dynamically generates diverse traffic behaviors of varying difficulty, adjusting them based on the student's performance, and the student is a deep RL agent designed to operate in partially observable environments.

Result: The automatic curriculum enabled the student-agent to outperform rule-based agents by achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving in simulation tests, showcasing improved handling across common and critical traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: Automatic curriculum learning via the student-teacher mechanism enhances the robustness and generalization of RL driving policies, offering a scalable approach to training autonomous driving systems effectively.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces challenges in navigating complex real-world traffic,
requiring safe handling of both common and critical scenarios. Reinforcement
learning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to
learn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies
on rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current
scenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a
balance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which
progressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising
approach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies.
However, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula,
focusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics.
This work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum
learning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively
generates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive
mechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring
exposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though
exchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability,
reflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher's
ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors. The student, trained with
automatic curricula, outperformed agents trained on rule-based traffic,
achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving.

*Michael Amir,Guang Yang,Zhan Gao,Keisuke Okumura,Heedo Woo,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReCoDe merges traditional optimization-based controllers with multi-agent reinforcement learning to improve coordination by dynamically learning additional constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of handcrafted constraints in multi-agent robotics, which often fail in complex and dynamic coordination scenarios.

Method: ReCoDe introduces a hybrid approach combining optimization-based controllers and multi-agent reinforcement learning, along with local communication for learning dynamic constraints.

Result: ReCoDe outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, existing hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines in multi-agent navigation tasks.

Conclusion: Dynamic constraint learning in ReCoDe enhances the reliability and adaptability of multi-agent systems, proving efficient by leveraging imperfect expert controllers rather than starting from scratch.

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the
design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as
collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints
can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce
ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid
framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with
the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding
expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic
constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent
movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local
communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to
coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus
on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate,
context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely
handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines.
We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a
user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than
learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the
degree to which it relies on this controller.

### [219] [Towards Multimodal Social Conversations with Robots: Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19196)
*Ruben Janssens,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper discusses leveraging vision-language models to improve multimodal interaction in social robots during open-domain conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social robots lack the ability to integrate multiple modalities in interactions, which limits their social conversational skills.

Method: The paper outlines the requirements of multimodal systems and explores adapting vision-language models for social robots.

Result: Vision-language models are identified as a general solution to process visual information for social robots, although technical challenges remain.

Conclusion: Vision-language models have the potential to enhance multimodal capabilities in robots, but their implementation and evaluation require further research.

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry
social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented
interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual
information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We
describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain,
and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

*Kang Xiangli,Yage He,Xianwu Gong,Zehan Liu,Yuru Bai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using diffusion models to locate centers of gravity for objects with uneven mass distribution, improving robotic grasping performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic grasping often struggles with postural instability caused by uneven mass distribution, prompting the need for a more accurate method for identifying centers of gravity.

Method: The authors developed a vision-driven framework based on diffusion models, supported by a dataset of 790 images annotated for CoG localization.

Result: The proposed approach showed a 49% higher success rate than traditional methods and an 11% improvement over affordance-driven approaches, demonstrating 76% accuracy in CoG localization for unseen objects.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel solution that enhances stability and precision in robotic grasping, especially for objects with uneven weight distribution.

Abstract: This study presents a grasping method for objects with uneven mass
distribution by leveraging diffusion models to localize the center of gravity
(CoG) on unknown objects. In robotic grasping, CoG deviation often leads to
postural instability, where existing keypoint-based or affordance-driven
methods exhibit limitations. We constructed a dataset of 790 images featuring
unevenly distributed objects with keypoint annotations for CoG localization. A
vision-driven framework based on foundation models was developed to achieve
CoG-aware grasping. Experimental evaluations across real-world scenarios
demonstrate that our method achieves a 49\% higher success rate compared to
conventional keypoint-based approaches and an 11\% improvement over
state-of-the-art affordance-driven methods. The system exhibits strong
generalization with a 76\% CoG localization accuracy on unseen objects,
providing a novel solution for precise and stable grasping tasks.

Rigby*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study explores an Engineering Agent based on LLMs to repair source code autonomously using test failures as guidance, achieving a solve rate of 42.3% in benchmarks and landing 31.5% of fixes in production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for scalable program repair across large codebases, aiming to address test failures in diverse software settings.

Method: The agent, based on Llama and ReAct harness, uses 15 predefined actions to reason, generate patches, and refine fixes based on feedback from static analysis and test failures.

Result: Offline benchmarks showed a competitive 70B model achieving 42.3% solve rate with 11.8 iterations, and production findings revealed 31.5% of reviewed fixes were successfully implemented.

Conclusion: The Engineering Agent demonstrates potential in autonomous code repair, receiving positive engineer feedback but still requiring refinement for broader applicability.

Abstract: Aim: With the advent of LLMs, sophisticated agentic program repair has become
viable at large organizations with large codebases. In this work, we develop an
Engineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale
across diverse software offerings internally.
  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an
agent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test
failure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason
and run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We
provide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it
can refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch
conforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.
  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,
the Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we
found that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger
but vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness
(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis
tools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the
solve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of
42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.
  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were
reviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated
fixes).
  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes
from engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick
approvals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the
Engineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good
starting point.

*Yiping Jia,Zhen Ming Jiang,Shayan Noei,Ying Zou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MemoCoder is a multi-agent framework for code generation and debugging using LLMs, outperforming prior methods by leveraging persistent learning and collaborative problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face challenges using traditional LLMs for code generation tasks that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation. Current solutions like fine-tuning or self-repair are either costly or fail to reuse accumulated knowledge.

Method: MemoCoder introduces a Fixing Knowledge Set for storing and retrieving successful fixes, coupled with a Mentor Agent supervising the self-repair process to refine strategies and accumulate knowledge.

Result: MemoCoder consistently achieves significant improvement in Pass@10 and Pass@50 benchmarks across MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench, outperforming zero-shot and self-repair strategies.

Conclusion: The framework enhances iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation for diverse and complex programming tasks, showcasing the feasibility of collaborative learning in code repair systems.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub
Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to
support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct
solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with
challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to
diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or
self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to
accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.
  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework
that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past
fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores
successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor
Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and
refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that
guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public
benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem
complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms
both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging
from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating
its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes bugs and vulnerabilities in data science Jupyter notebooks, highlighting configuration issues, API misuse, and security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jupyter notebooks, widely used by data scientists, pose analysis challenges due to unique features and lack of support compared to traditional software.

Method: The study combines quantitative metrics analysis and qualitative grounded theory to analyze bugs, alongside investigating security-related vulnerabilities in deployment frameworks.

Result: Configuration issues lead as the most frequent bugs, followed by incorrect API usage. Vulnerabilities in deployment frameworks are also identified.

Conclusion: Notebooks are less supported than traditional software, resulting in complex code, misconfigurations, and poor maintenance practices.

Abstract: Background. Jupyter notebooks are one of the main tools used by data
scientists. Notebooks include features (configuration scripts, markdown,
images, etc.) that make them challenging to analyze compared to traditional
software. As a result, existing software engineering models, tools, and studies
do not capture the uniqueness of Notebook's behavior. Aims. This paper aims to
provide a large-scale empirical study of bugs and vulnerabilities in the
Notebook ecosystem. Method. We collected and analyzed a large dataset of
Notebooks from two major platforms. Our methodology involved quantitative
analyses of notebook characteristics (such as complexity metrics, contributor
activity, and documentation) to identify factors correlated with bugs.
Additionally, we conducted a qualitative study using grounded theory to
categorize notebook bugs, resulting in a comprehensive bug taxonomy. Finally,
we analyzed security-related commits and vulnerability reports to assess risks
associated with Notebook deployment frameworks. Results. Our findings highlight
that configuration issues are among the most common bugs in notebook documents,
followed by incorrect API usage. Finally, we explore common vulnerabilities
associated with popular deployment frameworks to better understand risks
associated with Notebook development. Conclusions. This work highlights that
notebooks are less well-supported than traditional software, resulting in more
complex code, misconfiguration, and poor maintenance.

### [226] [SLICEMATE: Accurate and Scalable Static Program Slicing via LLM-Powered Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18957)
*Jianming Chang,Jieke Shi,Yunbo Lyu,Xin Zhou,Lulu Wang,Zhou Yang,Bixin Li,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SliceMate is a static program slicing solution powered by Large Language Model agents, designed to outperform traditional and learning-based slicing tools without reliance on dependency graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional program slicing tools which lack efficiency and scalability, and to improve upon learning-based methods that fail to perform well on well-formed code.

Method: SliceMate uses Large Language Models integrated into a framework with three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis agent for candidate slice generation, (2) a verification agent for checking conciseness and completeness, and (3) a refinement agent for slice adjustments. These agents are coordinated by a control module to ensure iterative improvement and high-quality output.

Result: SliceMate achieves superior slicing accuracy on a new benchmark (SliceBench) of 2,200 Java and Python programs, significantly outperforming existing traditional and learning-based slicing tools.

Conclusion: SliceMate offers a scalable and automated solution for static program slicing by leveraging LLMs, providing high-quality slices that support debugging and security tasks while overcoming the shortcomings of previous methods.

Abstract: Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program
that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis
tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing
tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency
graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code
with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more
robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to
traditional methods on well-formed code.
  In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution
powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit
dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy.
Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis
agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope
across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a
verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the
candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a
refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with
the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module
that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual
intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality
benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python
programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly
larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing
tools.

TL;DR: The paper explores using ML and DNN models to classify GitHub issues into predefined labels, aiming to streamline issue resolution and expedite the development process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most GitHub repositories lack systematic labeling of issues, making it harder for developers to efficiently address and assign the problems.

Method: The authors analyze data from various prominent GitHub repositories and apply Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to classify issues into common predefined labels.

Result: The study demonstrates that DNN models outperform other approaches in accurately classifying GitHub issues into labels.

Conclusion: Automated issue labeling using DNN models can significantly improve issue resolution speed and overall efficiency in open-source software projects.

Abstract: GitHub is the most widely used platform for software maintenance in the
open-source community. Developers report issues on GitHub from time to time
while facing difficulties. Having labels on those issues can help developers
easily address those issues with prior knowledge of labels. However, most of
the GitHub repositories do not maintain regular labeling for the issues. The
goal of this work is to classify issues in the open-source community using ML
\& DNN models. There are thousands of open-source repositories on GitHub. Some
of the repositories label their issues properly whereas some of them do not.
When issues are pre-labeled, the problem-solving process and the immediate
assignment of corresponding personnel are facilitated for the team, thereby
expediting the development process. In this work, we conducted an analysis of
prominent GitHub open-source repositories. We classified the issues in some
common labels which are: API, Documentation, Enhancement, Question, Easy,
Help-wanted, Dependency, CI, Waiting for OP's response, Test, Bug, etc. Our

### [228] [Fine-Tuning Multilingual Language Models for Code Review: An Empirical Study on Industrial C# Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19271)
*Igli Begolli,Meltem Aksoy,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how fine-tuning language models (LMs) on C# datasets affects their performance in three automated code review tasks, showing that monolingual fine-tuning enhances accuracy but cannot match human reviewers for complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is time-intensive and demanding. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) create opportunities for automating core review tasks, prompting the need to explore effective methods for optimizing LMs for this purpose.

Method: The authors fine-tuned three LMs—CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill—on a C#-specific dataset consisting of public and industrial repositories. They tested these on three tasks: Quality Estimation, Comment Generation, and Code Refinement, comparing results against human reviewers and automated software analysis tools (ASATs).

Result: Monolingual fine-tuning improved LM accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual baselines. LMs performed well in routine tasks but were less effective in semantically complex scenarios compared to human reviewers.

Conclusion: Monolingual fine-tuning enhances the utility of LMs for automated code review, particularly for repetitive tasks, but human reviewers remain indispensable for complex or context-sensitive changes. Language-specific and task-specific fine-tuning is crucial for optimizing these models.

Abstract: Code review is essential for maintaining software quality but often
time-consuming and cognitively demanding, especially in industrial
environments. Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have opened new
avenues for automating core review tasks. This study presents the empirical
evaluation of monolingual fine-tuning on the performance of open-source LMs
across three key automated code review tasks: Code Change Quality Estimation,
Review Comment Generation, and Code Refinement. We fine-tuned three distinct
models, CodeReviewer, CodeLlama-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill, on a C\# specific
dataset combining public benchmarks with industrial repositories. Our study
investigates how different configurations of programming languages and natural
languages in the training data affect LM performance, particularly in comment
generation. Additionally, we benchmark the fine-tuned models against an
automated software analysis tool (ASAT) and human reviewers to evaluate their
practical utility in real-world settings. Our results show that monolingual
fine-tuning improves model accuracy and relevance compared to multilingual
baselines. While LMs can effectively support code review workflows, especially
for routine or repetitive tasks, human reviewers remain superior in handling
semantically complex or context-sensitive changes. Our findings highlight the
importance of language alignment and task-specific adaptation in optimizing LMs
for automated code review.

### [229] [SESR-Eval: Dataset for Evaluating LLMs in the Title-Abstract Screening of Systematic Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19027)
*Aleksi Huotala,Miikka Kuutila,Mika Mäntylä*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper evaluates and benchmarks large language models (LLMs) in the systematic review (SR) title-abstract screening process within software engineering, concluding that LLMs are not yet reliable for automation due to varying accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the feasibility of using LLMs for SR title-abstract screening in software engineering and provide a benchmark dataset for performance evaluation.

Method: The researchers developed the SESR-Eval dataset from 24 secondary studies and benchmarked nine LLMs on screening tasks, examining accuracy and costs.

Result: The SESR-Eval dataset includes 34,528 labeled studies, and the performance variation between LLMs was minimal compared to variations across secondary studies. Costs were under $40 per study for all evaluated models.

Conclusion: Current LLMs cannot reliably automate title-abstract screenings in software engineering SRs due to inconsistent recall and precision. Future work will focus on factors affecting their screening performance.

Abstract: Background: The use of large language models (LLMs) in the title-abstract
screening process of systematic reviews (SRs) has shown promising results, but
suffers from limited performance evaluation. Aims: Create a benchmark dataset
to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the title-abstract screening process of
SRs. Provide evidence whether using LLMs in title-abstract screening in
software engineering is advisable. Method: We start with 169 SR research
artifacts and find 24 of those to be suitable for inclusion in the dataset.
Using the dataset we benchmark title-abstract screening using 9 LLMs. Results:
We present the SESR-Eval (Software Engineering Systematic Review Evaluation)
dataset containing 34,528 labeled primary studies, sourced from 24 secondary
studies published in software engineering (SE) journals. Most LLMs performed
similarly and the differences in screening accuracy between secondary studies
are greater than differences between LLMs. The cost of using an LLM is
relatively low - less than $40 per secondary study even for the most expensive
model. Conclusions: Our benchmark enables monitoring AI performance in the
screening task of SRs in software engineering. At present, LLMs are not yet
recommended for automating the title-abstract screening process, since accuracy
varies widely across secondary studies, and no LLM managed a high recall with
reasonable precision. In future, we plan to investigate factors that influence
LLM screening performance between studies.

### [230] [Exploring the Use of LLMs for Requirements Specification in an IT Consulting Company](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19113)
*Liliana Pasquale,Azzurra Ragone,Emanuele Piemontese,Armin Amiri Darban*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate generating functional design specifications for IT requirements within a consulting company.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of fragmented knowledge sources in the requirements specification process, which make it cumbersome and time-intensive.

Method: The authors used LLMs to generate Epic Functional Design Specifications (including user stories) by providing LLMs with summaries of elicitation documents and templates. They compared the quality and correctness of outputs from three LLMs to human analysts' work.

Result: LLMs were effective in automating and standardizing requirements specification, reducing time and effort. However, LLMs' outputs depend on input quality and require human revisions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while LLMs can function as effective drafting tools, a collaborative approach where human analysts provide oversight maximizes the quality of requirements documentation.

Abstract: In practice, requirements specification remains a critical challenge. The
knowledge necessary to generate a specification can often be fragmented across
diverse sources (e.g., meeting minutes, emails, and high-level product
descriptions), making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. In this paper,
we report our experience using large language models (LLMs) in an IT consulting
company to automate the requirements specification process. In this company,
requirements are specified using a Functional Design Specification (FDS), a
document that outlines the functional requirements and features of a system,
application, or process. We provide LLMs with a summary of the requirements
elicitation documents and FDS templates, prompting them to generate Epic FDS
(including high-level product descriptions) and user stories, which are
subsequently compiled into a complete FDS document. We compared the correctness
and quality of the FDS generated by three state-of-the-art LLMs against those
produced by human analysts. Our results show that LLMs can help automate and
standardize the requirements specification, reducing time and human effort.
However, the quality of LLM-generated FDS highly depends on inputs and often
requires human revision. Thus, we advocate for a synergistic approach in which
an LLM serves as an effective drafting tool while human analysts provide the
critical contextual and technical oversight necessary for high-quality
requirements engineering (RE) documentation.

*Matthias Weiß,Falk Dettinger,Michael Weyrich*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDVDiag, a platform for automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions using dynamic dependencies and anomaly graph analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected vehicles face challenges in quickly diagnosing and resolving failures due to complex architectures and dependencies.

Method: The SDVDiag platform collects data, dynamically updates function dependencies as a graph, monitors anomalies, and ranks likely causes through automated analysis pipelines.

Result: Injected faults in a 5G test fleet environment were reliably detected, showing the platform's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SDVDiag reduces downtime and provides insights by addressing faults early, leveraging self-adaptive and automated diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Connected and software-defined vehicles promise to offer a broad range of
services and advanced functions to customers, aiming to increase passenger
comfort and support autonomous driving capabilities. Due to the high
reliability and availability requirements of connected vehicles, it is crucial
to resolve any occurring failures quickly. To achieve this however, a complex
cloud/edge architecture with a mesh of dependencies must be navigated to
diagnose the responsible root cause. As such, manual analyses become unfeasible
since they would significantly delay the troubleshooting.
  To address this challenge, this paper presents SDVDiag, an extensible
platform for the automated diagnosis of connected vehicle functions. The
platform enables the creation of pipelines that cover all steps from initial
data collection to the tracing of potential root causes. In addition, SDVDiag
supports self-adaptive behavior by the ability to exchange modules at runtime.
Dependencies between functions are detected and continuously updated, resulting
in a dynamic graph view of the system. In addition, vital system metrics are
monitored for anomalies. Whenever an incident is investigated, a snapshot of
the graph is taken and augmented by relevant anomalies. Finally, the analysis
is performed by traversing the graph and creating a ranking of the most likely
causes.
  To evaluate the platform, it is deployed inside an 5G test fleet environment
for connected vehicle functions. The results show that injected faults can be
detected reliably. As such, the platform offers the potential to gain new
insights and reduce downtime by identifying problems and their causes at an
early stage.

*Shweta Ramesh,Joy Bose,Hamender Singh,A K Raghavan,Sujoy Roychowdhury,Giriprasad Sridhara,Nishrith Saini,Ricardo Britto*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper discusses using Large Language Models (LLMs) and static analysis to automate code review, reducing developer workload.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is crucial for software quality but is time-consuming and requires experienced developers.

Method: The authors developed a lightweight tool combining LLMs and static analysis to automate code review.

Result: Preliminary experiments with experienced developers showed encouraging results for the tool.

Conclusion: Automating code review using LLMs reduces cognitive burden, enabling developers to focus on feature development and bug fixing.

Abstract: Code review is one of the primary means of assuring the quality of released
software along with testing and static analysis. However, code review requires
experienced developers who may not always have the time to perform an in-depth
review of code. Thus, automating code review can help alleviate the cognitive
burden on experienced software developers allowing them to focus on their
primary activities of writing code to add new features and fix bugs. In this
paper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards
automating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of
a lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our
preliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code
review tool and the encouraging results.

### [233] [An OpenSource CI/CD Pipeline for Variant-Rich Software-Defined Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19446)
*Matthias Weiß,Anish Navalgund,Johannes Stümpfle,Falk Dettinger,Michael Weyrich*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an open-source, scalable CI/CD pipeline for software-defined vehicles (SDVs), enabling seamless software updates and orchestration tailored to hardware variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address challenges in SDV development, such as fragmented development environments and the need for efficient software version management across diverse systems.

Method: A standardized CI/CD pipeline integrates containerized open-source tools for development, testing, and deployment, with custom middleware for OTA updates and variant selection based on hardware dependencies.

Result: The effectiveness of the pipeline is demonstrated through an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario, showcasing reliable OTA updates, accurate variant selection, and effective orchestration.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers a scalable and efficient method for SDV software management, advancing connected mobility and autonomous driving technologies.

Abstract: Software-defined vehicles (SDVs) offer a wide range of connected
functionalities, including enhanced driving behavior and fleet management.
These features are continuously updated via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms,
resulting in a growing number of software versions and variants due to the
diversity of vehicles, cloud/edge environments, and stakeholders involved. The
lack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as
connected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable
operations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions
that considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper
presents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the
build, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized
open-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem
accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware
distributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend
services. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies
and hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development
and deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness
is evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving
TurtleBots and a coordinating backend server. Two object detection variants are
developed and deployed to match hardware-specific requirements. Results
demonstrate seamless OTA updates, correct variant selection, and successful
orchestration across all targets. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a
scalable and efficient solution for managing software variants and OTA updates
in SDVs, contributing to the advancement of future mobility technologies.

*Bo Wang,Pengyang Wang,Chong Chen,Qi Sun,Jieke Shi,Chengran Yang,Ming Deng,Youfang Lin,Zhou Yang,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Mut4All, an LLM-powered automated framework for generating compiler bug-finding mutators. It achieves cross-language scalability and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges of manual mutator design for bug-finding in compilers, particularly for modern languages with complex constructs, and overcome limitations in scalability and generalizability.

Method: Mut4All system uses an LLM framework with three agents: (1) a mutator invention agent to identify mutation targets, (2) an implementation synthesis agent to create initial implementations, and (3) a refinement agent to validate and improve implementations using unit tests.

Result: Using 1000 bug reports, Mut4All synthesizes 319 Rust and 403 C++ mutators at low cost. It discovered 62 Rust compiler bugs (38 new) and 34 C++ compiler bugs (16 new). Outperformed existing fuzzing tools in bug discovery and code coverage.

Conclusion: Mut4All demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of leveraging LLMs to automate the creation of language-agnostic mutators for compilers, achieving significant bug detection performance across languages.

Abstract: Mutation-based fuzzing is effective for uncovering compiler bugs, but
designing high-quality mutators for modern languages with complex constructs
(e.g., templates, macros) remains challenging. Existing methods rely heavily on
manual design or human-in-the-loop correction, limiting scalability and
cross-language generalizability.
  We present Mut4All, a fully automated, language-agnostic framework that
synthesizes mutators using Large Language Models (LLMs) and compiler-specific
knowledge from bug reports. It consists of three agents: (1) a mutator
invention agent that identifies mutation targets and generates mutator metadata
using compiler-related insights; (2) a mutator implementation synthesis agent,
fine-tuned to produce initial implementations; and (3) a mutator refinement
agent that verifies and corrects the mutators via unit-test feedback.
  Mut4All processes 1000 bug reports (500 Rust, 500 C++), yielding 319 Rust and
403 C++ mutators at ~$0.08 each via GPT-4o. Our customized fuzzer, using these
mutators, finds 62 bugs in Rust compilers (38 new, 7 fixed) and 34 bugs in C++
compilers (16 new, 1 fixed). Mut4All outperforms existing methods in both
unique crash detection and coverage, ranking first on Rust and second on C++.

### [235] [ReCatcher: Towards LLMs Regression Testing for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19390)
*Altaf Allah Abbassi,Leuson Da Silva,Amin Nikanjam,Foutse Khomh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ReCatcher is a regression testing framework for Python code generation that systematically evaluates updates in large language models (LLMs) to detect regressions in logical correctness, code quality, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With rapid advancements in LLMs for code generation, updates such as fine-tuning or new releases can unintentionally degrade performance or code quality, necessitating a systematic regression testing framework.

Method: ReCatcher compares two LLMs using three dimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution performance. It evaluates different update methods including fine-tuning, merging, and model releases, by applying tests to models like CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o.

Result: Testing revealed widespread regressions: fine-tuning with cross-language data increased syntax errors by 12%; merging with general-purpose models caused up to 18% accuracy drops; model updates like GPT-4o introduced significant regressions, including up to 50% failure in missing imports handling compared to GPT-3.5-turbo.

Conclusion: ReCatcher effectively identifies regression issues arising from updates in LLMs, underscoring the critical need for systematic testing to make informed decisions when adopting new models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation evolve rapidly through
fine-tuning, merging, or new model releases. However, such updates can
introduce regressions, not only in correctness but also in code quality and
performance. To address this, we present ReCatcher, a regression testing
framework for Python code generation. ReCatcher systematically compares two
LLMs, typically a current model and a candidate update, across three
dimensions: logical correctness, static code quality, and execution
performance. We apply ReCatcher to assess regressions across three update
scenarios, fine-tuning, merging, and model release, using CodeLlama,
DeepSeek-Coder, and GPT-4o. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning with
cross-language datasets increases syntax errors by up to 12%. Merging with
general-purpose models like Llama2 leads to regressions in correctness by up to
18%. GPT-4o introduces regressions of up to 50% in handling missing imports
compared to GPT-3.5-turbo, while GPT-4o-mini suffers up to 80% performance
degradation in execution time versus GPT-4o. Overall, logical correctness,
performance, and error handling (e.g., syntax errors and missing imports) are
the most regression-prone areas. Comparing ReCatcher with baseline solutions,
it presents better and consistent accuracy across logical and performance
aspects. ReCatcher highlights the importance of systematic regression
evaluation before adopting new models, while assisting researchers and
practitioners in making more informed update decisions.

### [236] [Resolving Build Conflicts via Example-Based and Rule-Based Program Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19432)
*Sheikh Shadab Towqir,Fei He,Todd Mytkowicz,Na Meng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BUCOR, a hybrid approach for resolving text and build conflicts during code merges, achieving promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools for resolving build conflicts during merges are insufficient, particularly for complex issues like method removal.

Method: BUCOR uses a hybrid strategy combining rule-based predefined rules (BUCOR-R) and example-based pattern learning (BUCOR-E) from branch versions.

Result: BUCOR resolved 43 out of 88 real-world build conflicts tested, demonstrating the effectiveness of its combined approach.

Conclusion: The hybrid method of BUCOR shows potential to improve intelligent and automated merge conflict resolution tools.

Abstract: Merge conflicts often arise when developers integrate changes from different
software branches. The conflicts can result from overlapping edits in programs
(i.e., textual conflicts) or cause build and test errors (i.e., build and test
conflicts). They degrade software quality and hinder programmer productivity.
While several tools detect build conflicts, few offer meaningful support for
resolving cases like those caused by method removal. To overcome limitations of
existing tools, we introduce BUCOR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict
resolver. BUCOR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to
a merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it
employs two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BUCOR-E)
and rule-based transformation (BUCOR-R). BUCOR-R applies predefined rules to
handle common, well-understood conflicts. BUCOR-E mines branch versions (l and
r) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors. From these examples,
it infers and generalizes program transformation patterns to resolve more
complex conflicts.
  We evaluated BUCOR on 88 real-world build conflicts spanning 21 distinct
conflict types. BUCOR generated at least one solution for 65 cases and
correctly resolved 43 conflicts. We observed that this hybrid
approach--combining context-aware, example-based learning with structured,
rule-based resolution--can effectively help resolve conflicts. Our research
sheds light on future directions for more intelligent and automated merge
tools.

*Ana Dudas,Ana Novak,Caroline Gora,Emmanuel Pecnard,Nicolas Azzopardi,Séverine Morisset-Lopez,Lucie P. Pellissier*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper examines the use of a mixed genetic mouse background (B6;129) as a preclinical model to improve behavioral variability and phenotypic relevance in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric research compared to a commonly used inbred strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preclinical models rely heavily on inbred strains like C57BL/6J, which lack genetic and behavioral diversity, limiting their ability to capture the traits of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.

Method: The study evaluates the behavioral traits of mixed genetic B6;129 mice against inbred B6 mice, focusing on sociability, self-grooming, chronic social isolation effects, and overall behavioral variability.

Result: Mixed B6;129 mice exhibited enhanced sociability, self-grooming, and a greater range of behavioral variability while being less affected by chronic social isolation compared to B6 mice.

Conclusion: The B6;129 mixed genetic background is a more representative and translationally relevant model for studying individual variability and traits linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.

Abstract: Preclinical models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions often
rely on inbred mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6), which exhibit limited genetic
and behavioral variability. This limitation hampers the modeling of phenotypic
heterogeneity, characteristic of these conditions. Recent efforts have explored
the use of multiple genetically diverse hybrid strains to address this. In this
study, we examined whether one single mixed genetic mouse background,
C57BL/6J;129S2/SvPas (B6;129), could simultaneously recapitulate behavioral
variability and display improved phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental and
psychiatric conditions. Compared to the inbred B6 strain, mixed B6;129 mice
displayed enhanced sociability and self-grooming, two key discriminating
parameters between the two mouse backgrounds and core features of such
conditions, alongside a broader spectrum of individual behavioral variability.
Although overall behavioral variability was comparable across backgrounds,
B6;129 mice were less susceptible to the effects of chronic social isolation
than their B6 counterparts. Together, these findings support that the B6;129
mixed background offers a more representative model of individual variability
and behavioral traits associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
conditions, thereby enhancing its translational relevance in preclinical
studies.

*Sreshta Venkatakrishnan,Andrew K. Tryba,Alfredo J. Garcia 3rd,Yangyang Wang*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: This paper explores how the neuromodulator norepinephrine (NE) impacts neuron-specific properties in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), a network responsible for respiratory rhythm. Using a computational model, it identifies how NE influences neuronal bursting patterns, enhancing understanding of neuromodulation in respiration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the gap in understanding how neuromodulators like norepinephrine specifically affect neuron properties that regulate respiratory rhythm, crucial for survival.

Method: The research employs a computational model to simulate NE's impact on preBötC neurons by altering two parameters: calcium-activated nonspecific cationic current gating conductance and inositol-triphosphate levels, and validates the model against experimental findings.

Result: The model successfully captures the experimentally observed effects of NE, showing its dual mechanism role in modulating bursting patterns and identifying conditions for neuron inactivity. It also distinguishes NE's modulation in NaP- versus CAN-dependent bursting neurons.

Conclusion: The findings provide a mechanistic insight into how NE modulates neuron-specific properties in respiratory networks, offering alignment with experimental data and advancing knowledge of neuromodulation at a cellular level.

Abstract: Respiration is an essential involuntary function necessary for survival. This
poses a challenge for the control of breathing. The preB\"otzinger complex
(preB\"otC) is a heterogeneous neuronal network responsible for driving the
inspiratory rhythm. While neuromodulators such as norepinephrine (NE) allow it
to be both robust and flexible for all living beings to interact with their
environment, the basis for how neuromodulation impacts neuron-specific
properties remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine how NE
influences different preB\"otC neuronal subtypes by modeling its effects
through modulating two key parameters: calcium-activated nonspecific cationic
current gating conductance ($g_{\rm CAN}$) and inositol-triphosphate ($\rm
IP_3$), guided by experimental studies. Our computational model captures the
experimentally observed differential effects of NE on distinct preB\"otC
bursting patterns. We show that this dual mechanism is critical for inducing
conditional bursting and identify specific parameter regimes where silent
neurons remain inactive in the presence of NE. Furthermore, using methods of
dynamical systems theory, we uncover the mechanisms by which NE differentially
modulates burst frequency and duration in NaP-dependent and CAN-dependent
bursting neurons. These results align well with previously reported
experimental findings and provide a deeper understanding of cell-specific
neuromodulatory responses within the respiratory network.

*Chenghui Li,Nicolás García Trillos,Housen Li,Leo Suchan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This work analyzes the asymptotic fluctuations of eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian related to manifolds supported in Euclidean space, deriving Gaussian limits and statistical interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the variability in graph Laplacian eigenvalues derived from data on low-dimensional manifolds and explore their relationship with statistical efficiency and geometry.

Method: Using theoretical analysis, the paper proves central limit theorems for eigenvalues under certain assumptions, derives their variances, links these to Fisher-Rao geometry, and validates findings through numerical experiments.

Result: The eigenvalues are shown to have asymptotic Gaussian behavior, with variance characterized by a Fisher-Rao energy framework, and are suggested to have a statistical efficiency interpretation.

Conclusion: The study deepens the understanding of eigenvalue behavior under graph Laplacians, connecting their statistical and geometric properties and showing their potential efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution
supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we
consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an
$\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations
of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting
$\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and
under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of
decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon
- \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with
a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to
interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a
suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric
interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the
asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of
the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter
interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple
eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of
our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical
analysis are relaxed.

### [240] [Probably Approximately Correct Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18903)
*Mian Wei,Somesh Jha,David Page*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC) Discovery framework, inspired by PAC learning, to address causal discoveries under finite data and resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between elegant causal theories suitable for infinite resources and the practical need for computational and sample-efficient causal discovery methods under real-world constraints.

Method: The authors propose the PACC Discovery framework, extending PAC learning principles to causal discovery and applying it to methods like propensity scores, instrumental variables, and the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS).

Result: The PACC framework is shown to provide theoretical guarantees for established methods and previously unsupported methodologies like SCCS, enhancing their reliability under resource limitations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the PACC framework is a step forward in achieving computationally and sample-efficient causal discovery with theoretical guarantees, even in finite-resource scenarios.

Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships is a foundational problem in artificial
intelligence, statistics, epidemiology, economics, and beyond. While elegant
theories exist for accurate causal discovery given infinite data, real-world
applications are inherently resource-constrained. Effective methods for
inferring causal relationships from observational data must perform well under
finite data and time constraints, where "performing well" implies achieving
high, though not perfect accuracy. In his seminal paper A Theory of the
Learnable, Valiant highlighted the importance of resource constraints in
supervised machine learning, introducing the concept of Probably Approximately
Correct (PAC) learning as an alternative to exact learning. Inspired by
Valiant's work, we propose the Probably Approximately Correct Causal (PACC)
Discovery framework, which extends PAC learning principles to the causal field.
This framework emphasizes both computational and sample efficiency for
established causal methods such as propensity score techniques and instrumental
variable approaches. Furthermore, we show that it can also provide theoretical
guarantees for other widely used methods, such as the Self-Controlled Case
Series (SCCS) method, which had previously lacked such guarantees.

Motivation: The study aims to address the key challenge of identifying groups of layers with unique subspace structures in multilayer network models, as the previously explored fully dense settings are less widely applicable.

Method: The authors propose a tensor-based methodology, which pools information across all layers and eliminates the need for layer-by-layer analysis, enabling clustering even in sparse network conditions.

Result: The method achieves perfect clustering in sparse networks under sparsity conditions that align closely with computational lower bounds for simpler models.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology significantly advances clustering in multilayer networks by operating effectively under sparse conditions, broadening its applicability to real-world network scenarios.

Abstract: The paper studies the DIverse MultiPLEx Signed Generalized Random Dot Product
Graph (DIMPLE-SGRDPG) network model (Pensky (2024)), where all layers of the
network have the same collection of nodes. In addition, all layers can be
partitioned into groups such that the layers in the same group are embedded in
the same ambient subspace but otherwise matrices of connection probabilities
can be all different. This setting includes majority of multilayer network
models as its particular cases. The key task in this model is to recover the
groups of layers with unique subspace structures, since the case where all
layers of the network are embedded in the same subspace has been fairly well
studied. Until now, clustering of layers in such networks was based on the
layer-per-layer analysis, which required the multilayer network to be
sufficiently dense. Nevertheless, in this paper we succeeded in pooling
information in all layers together and providing a tensor-based methodology
that ensures perfect clustering for a much sparser network. Our theoretical
results, established under intuitive non-restrictive assumptions, assert that
the new technique achieves perfect clustering under sparsity conditions that,
up to logarithmic factors, coincide with the computational lower bound derived
for a much simpler model.

### [242] [Optimizing Metachronal Paddling with Reinforcement Learning at Low Reynolds Number](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18849)
*Alana A. Bailey,Robert D. Guy*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper investigates the emergence of limb coordination patterns, such as metachronal paddling, in swimming through reinforcement learning, finding that efficiency isn’t universally linked to the commonly observed rhythmic strokes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the optimality of the metachronal rhythm, a swimming strategy observed across organisms, by testing whether such patterns emerge from reinforcement learning in zero Reynolds number environments.

Method: The research uses a reinforcement learning approach with swimmer agents designed as elongated bodies with inflexible paddles spaced at various intervals, analyzing the learned coordination patterns and their effectiveness.

Result: The learned strokes varied based on paddle spacing. At tight spacings, metachronal wave-like patterns resembling biological rhythms emerged. At wide spacings, other limb coordination patterns were selected. Efficiency peaked with back-to-front strokes regardless of paddle count.

Conclusion: Metachronal rhythm consistently emerges at tight paddle spacing as the most efficient swimming strategy, reaffirming its biological prevalence while indicating other viable coordination strategies may apply under specific conditions.

Abstract: Metachronal paddling is a swimming strategy in which an organism oscillates
sets of adjacent limbs with a constant phase lag, propagating a metachronal
wave through its limbs and propelling it forward. This limb coordination
strategy is utilized by swimmers across a wide range of Reynolds numbers, which
suggests that this metachronal rhythm was selected for its optimality of
swimming performance. In this study, we apply reinforcement learning to a
swimmer at zero Reynolds number and investigate whether the learning algorithm
selects this metachronal rhythm, or if other coordination patterns emerge. We
design the swimmer agent with an elongated body and pairs of straight,
inflexible paddles placed along the body for various fixed paddle spacings.
Based on paddle spacing, the swimmer agent learns qualitatively different
coordination patterns. At tight spacings, a back-to-front metachronal wave-like
stroke emerges which resembles the commonly observed biological rhythm, but at
wide spacings, different limb coordinations are selected. Across all resulting
strokes, the fastest stroke is dependent on the number of paddles, however, the
most efficient stroke is a back-to-front wave-like stroke regardless of the
number of paddles.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This study presents a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) active learning framework to optimize lithium carbonate crystallization from lower-grade resources, improving impurity tolerance to 6000 ppm while maintaining product quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for high-purity lithium in the EV industry requires an economical way to extract lithium from lower-grade, impurity-rich North American sources, such as the Smackover Formation.

Method: The study employs a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning approach to optimize the continuous crystallization process for lithium carbonate, combining human expertise with AI-driven insights to overcome complex impurity challenges.

Result: The framework achieves rapid adaptation to new data and improves impurity tolerance, increasing it from an industry standard of a few hundred ppm to 6000 ppm, enabling the use of lower-grade lithium materials economically.

Conclusion: This framework represents a major advancement, making low-grade lithium resources viable for extraction, enhancing North America's lithium reserves' economic use, and promoting a sustainable global lithium supply chain.

Abstract: As demand for high-purity lithium surges with the growth of the electric
vehicle (EV) industry, cost-effective extraction from lower-grade North
American sources like the Smackover Formation is critical. These resources,
unlike high-purity South American brines, require innovative purification
techniques to be economically viable. Continuous crystallization is a promising
method for producing battery-grade lithium carbonate, but its optimization is
challenged by a complex parameter space and limited data. This study introduces
a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) assisted active learning framework to optimize the
continuous crystallization of lithium carbonate. By integrating human expertise
with data-driven insights, our approach accelerates the optimization of lithium
extraction from challenging sources. Our results demonstrate the framework's
ability to rapidly adapt to new data, significantly improving the process's
tolerance to critical impurities like magnesium from the industry standard of a
few hundred ppm to as high as 6000 ppm. This breakthrough makes the
exploitation of low-grade, impurity-rich lithium resources feasible,
potentially reducing the need for extensive pre-refinement processes. By
leveraging artificial intelligence, we have refined operational parameters and
demonstrated that lower-grade materials can be used without sacrificing product
quality. This advancement is a significant step towards economically harnessing
North America's vast lithium reserves, such as those in the Smackover
Formation, and enhancing the sustainability of the global lithium supply chain.

*Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan,Luis Gustavo Nonato,Themis Palpanas,Cláudio T. Silva,Juliana Freire*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces TiVy, a novel algorithm designed to summarize and visually simplify multiple time series data using sequential patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series data visualization often suffers from scalability and visual clutter issues when dealing with large datasets and overlapping data points.

Method: TiVy uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to identify subsequence visual similarities and groups similar subsequences using frequent sequential patterns, constructing more interpretable visual summaries.

Result: TiVy achieves 1000X speed improvements over traditional DTW-based clustering, extracts clear and accurate patterns, and facilitates uncovering hidden structures in large-scale time series data.

Conclusion: TiVy represents an innovative and efficient solution for visualizing complex time series data, enhancing clarity and scalability while enabling real-time interactions.

Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between
scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many
large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.
Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or
superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and
patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when
covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small
multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that
summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into
a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar
subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a
visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer
small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar
subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an
interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in
real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts
clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a
significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We
also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in
massive time series data in two usage scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods of creating realistic wide-scale outdoor 3D content are costly, labor-intensive, and often lack accuracy in representing real-world landscapes.

Method: The paper introduces a process to automatically amplify scanned real-world data and render it in real-time 3D animation suitable for close-range exploration.

Result: The proposed method delivers high-quality 3D content efficiently, minimizing the need for extensive manual effort by teams of artists.

Conclusion: The automated approach is valuable for numerous applications, including training, simulation, video games, and visualizations, making content creation more accessible and accurate.

Abstract: Building realistic wide scale outdoor 3D content with sufficient visual
quality to observe at walking eye level or from driven vehicles is often
carried out by large teams of artists skilled in modelling, texturing, material
shading and lighting, which typically leads to both prohibitive costs and
reduced accuracy honoring the variety of real world ground truth landscapes. In
our proposed method, we define a process to automatically amplify real-world
scanned data and render real-time in animated 3D to explore at close range with
high quality for training, simulation, video game and visualisation
applications.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: This paper focuses on efficiently controlling coverage problems with time-varying density functions modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). The results highlight improvements in minimizing coverage cost and demonstrate practical applications using drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coverage control for time-varying density functions, which are commonly simplified or approximated, especially for evolving density functions such as chemical plumes.

Method: The authors propose a time-varying coverage controller that integrates Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and considers known velocities of time-varying density sources. The method is computationally efficient and distributed.

Result: Simulations reveal that the proposed controller minimizes overall coverage cost compared to classical methods. Experimental field trials with drones demonstrate successful tracking of a simulated time-varying chemical plume.

Conclusion: The controller efficiently achieves time-varying coverage control with computational advantages and distributed implementation, making it suitable for multi-vehicle robotic systems.

Abstract: In coverage control problems that involve time-varying density functions, the
coverage control law depends on spatial integrals of the time evolution of the
density function. The latter is often neglected, replaced with an upper bound
or calculated as a numerical approximation of the spatial integrals involved.
In this paper, we consider a special case of time-varying density functions
modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) that evolve with time via a set of
time-varying sources (with known corresponding velocities). By imposing this
structure, we obtain an efficient time-varying coverage controller that fully
incorporates the time evolution of the density function. We show that the
induced trajectories under our control law minimise the overall coverage cost.
We elicit the structure of the proposed controller and compare it with a
classical time-varying coverage controller, against which we benchmark the
coverage performance in simulation. Furthermore, we highlight that the
computationally efficient and distributed nature of the proposed control law
makes it ideal for multi-vehicle robotic applications involving time-varying
coverage control problems. We employ our method in plume monitoring using a
swarm of drones. In an experimental field trial we show that drones guided by
the proposed controller are able to track a simulated time-varying chemical
plume in a distributed manner.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an advanced framework for equitable energy allocation in community microgrids, utilizing machine learning and cooperative game theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fair energy distribution in socio-economically diverse microgrid communities, overcoming limitations of static optimization methods that fail to adapt to inequities.

Method: The authors propose a bi-level optimization framework combining multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game theory, and reinforcement learning (RL), specifically using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), for dynamic equity adjustments.

Result: The framework achieved up to a 72.6% reduction in peak demand, improved cooperative outcomes, and decreased socio-economic inequities (as evidenced by a reduced Gini coefficient).

Conclusion: This novel framework effectively fosters sustainable and equitable energy allocation in community microgrids by dynamically addressing socio-economic inequities and ensuring fair resource access.

Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical
challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants.
Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving
inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable
cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game
theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement
learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization
model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles,
which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least
advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization
objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access.
This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt,
continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency,
Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from
a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the
framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant
cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini
coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair
energy communities.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper addresses a matrix approximation problem using matrix-vector product queries. It demonstrates that the query complexity for learning structured approximations from a general matrix family can be improved nearly quadratically compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the study is to address the problem of efficiently finding structured approximations of unknown matrices, a challenge that is pivotal to numerous algorithms in scientific computing and machine learning.

Method: The paper uses matrix-vector product query methods and explores their application to derive complexity bounds for learning structured approximations. It generalizes existing bounds using covering number arguments and matvec techniques.

Result: The key result shows that matrix approximations from finite families can be achieved with up to a nearly quadratic improvement in query complexity, reducing the query requirement from O(log|F|) to approximately O(sqrt(log|F|)).

Conclusion: This work advances the field by achieving tighter complexity bounds in the matvec model, showcasing significant improvements for both finite and certain infinite matrix families, and offering practical implications for various applications in matrix computation and optimization.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a structured approximation (low-rank,
sparse, banded, etc.) to an unknown matrix $A$ given access to matrix-vector
product (matvec) queries of the form $x \rightarrow Ax$ and $x \rightarrow
A^Tx$. This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific
computing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and
inversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order
optimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work
focuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning
specific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.
  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to
understand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix
families. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to
$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\mathcal{F}$. Standard results
from matrix sketching show that $O(\log|\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice
in this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for
vector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have
been widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.
  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a
nearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log|\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is
tight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends
to well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a
near-optimal approximation from any \emph{linear matrix family} of dimension
$q$ can be learned with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an
$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector
queries.

Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face

Motivation: To optimize PWS functions where the partition of the domain is unknown and improve upon existing methods with better convergence rates and termination criteria.

Method: The authors designed a Bundle-Level (BL) type method, extended it for approximately PWS and weakly-convex settings, and developed a guess-and-check framework with a verifiable termination criterion.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves global linear convergence for PWS functions under a quadratic growth condition and state-of-the-art complexity for solving weakly-convex problems.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational advancements in PWS optimization, including convergence guarantees, accuracy in termination criteria, and near parameter-free implementation for specific settings.

Abstract: We develop efficient algorithms for optimizing piecewise smooth (PWS)
functions where the underlying partition of the domain into smooth pieces is
\emph{unknown}. For PWS functions satisfying a quadratic growth (QG) condition,
we propose a bundle-level (BL) type method that achieves global linear
convergence -- to our knowledge, the first such result for any algorithm for
this problem class. We extend this method to handle approximately PWS functions
and to solve weakly-convex PWS problems, improving the state-of-the-art
complexity to match the benchmark for smooth non-convex optimization.
Furthermore, we introduce the first verifiable and accurate termination
criterion for PWS optimization. Similar to the gradient norm in smooth
optimization, this certificate tightly characterizes the optimality gap under
the QG condition, and can moreover be evaluated without knowledge of any
problem parameters. We develop a search subroutine for this certificate and
embed it within a guess-and-check framework, resulting in an almost
parameter-free algorithm for both the convex QG and weakly-convex settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing piecewise constant MS models, such as the focus on shortest boundaries, and to improve segmentation on irregular mesh structures.

Method: Developed a piecewise smooth MS model incorporating rTGV regularization, solved using alternating minimization and ADMM techniques.

Result: The proposed method yields competitive segmentation results compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with better boundaries, robustness, and efficiency.

Conclusion: The new MS model with rTGV offers improved results for meshes with irregular structures, reducing quantitative errors and computational costs while maintaining robustness and effectiveness.

Abstract: The Mumford-Shah (MS) model is an important technique for mesh segmentation.
Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model
with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of
boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a
novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed
total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that
the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise
constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to
characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly
introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures
and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve
the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and
comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that
our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In
addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art
techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,
the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method.

Motivation: Current interatomic potentials in materials science cannot account for fractional atomic existence or effectively optimize grand canonical systems.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for

State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message

predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism
with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic
existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy
with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence.
Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the iterative transformation of self-referential processes aligns with the equilibrium in revision dialogues, proving this result using classical and transfinite fixed point theorems, then embedding it into type theory for verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous foundation for reasoning about infinite self-referential systems and provide practical tools for certifying their convergence within computational setups.

Method: Utilizes classical and transfinite fixed point theorems, well-founded induction, and order-theoretic continuity, embedding the resulting operator into dependent type theory for verification.

Result: Proves that the iterative self-referential process necessarily stabilizes to a unique limit, verified via machine-checked proof in modern proof assistants.

Conclusion: This work supports Alpay's claim of semantic convergence and unifies concepts from fixed point theory, game semantics, ordinal analysis, and type theory, offering a formal approach to infinite self-referential systems.

Abstract: This paper contributes to the Alpay Algebra by demonstrating that the stable
outcome of a self referential process, obtained by iterating a transformation
through all ordinal stages, is identical to the unique equilibrium of an
unbounded revision dialogue between a system and its environment. The analysis
initially elucidates how classical fixed point theorems guarantee such
convergence in finite settings and subsequently extends the argument to the
transfinite domain, relying upon well founded induction and principles of order
theoretic continuity.
  Furthermore, the resulting transordinal fixed point operator is embedded into
dependent type theory, a formalization which permits every step of the
transfinite iteration and its limit to be verified within a modern proof
assistant. This procedure yields a machine checked proof that the iterative
dialogue necessarily stabilizes and that its limit is unique. The result
provides a foundation for Alpay's philosophical claim of semantic convergence
within the framework of constructive logic. By unifying concepts from fixed
point theory, game semantics, ordinal analysis, and type theory, this research
establishes a broadly accessible yet formally rigorous foundation for reasoning
about infinite self referential systems and offers practical tools for
certifying their convergence within computational environments.

### [257] [Adaptive Neural Quantum States: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18700)
*Jake McNaughton,Mohamed Hibat-Allah*

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive optimization technique for neural-network quantum states (NQSs) using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), significantly reducing computational cost and improving training reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency and training fluctuations in optimizing neural-network quantum states (NQSs) for studying quantum many-body systems.

Method: An adaptive scheme for optimization, where smaller recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are trained first and then reused as initialization for larger RNNs to improve efficiency and performance.

Result: The adaptive optimization method successfully reduced computational costs, minimized training fluctuations, and enhanced the quality of variational calculations for ground states in one- and two-dimensional quantum models.

Conclusion: This approach provides a systematic and computationally efficient pathway for optimizing NQSs and enhances GPU resource utilization, paving the way for more scalable quantum many-body simulations.

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes
that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics
through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to
be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we
demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of
recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while
reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational
calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and
two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost
through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This
work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU)
resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.

TL;DR: AI chatbots are popular for emotional support but pose risks like belief destabilization and dependence, especially for vulnerable individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the potential mental health risks posed by AI chatbots as they interact with cognitive and emotional biases of users.

Method: Analyzing how human vulnerabilities like impaired reality-testing interact with chatbot tendencies like agreeableness and adaptability.

Result: Chatbots may lead to severe risks such as suicide, delusional thinking, and dependence, particularly for individuals with mental health issues.

Conclusion: Current AI safety frameworks are inadequate. Collaborative action is required across clinical fields, AI development, and regulation to address these public health risks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with
millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in
contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health
services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases
are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking
linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this
new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive
and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness
(sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals
with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief
destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired
reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are
inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging
public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI
development, and regulatory frameworks.

TL;DR: The research focuses on understanding how undergraduate dentistry students develop visual search skills in diagnosing dental radiographs using eye-gaze movements. Network analysis ties students' performance with eye movement metrics over semesters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how novices acquire expertise in visual search tasks, with implications for training optimization in various fields.

Method: Eye-gaze scanpaths were modeled as directed graphs and network analysis techniques were applied. Time series clustering identified patterns in metrics related to student diagnostic performance.

Result: Network metrics like transition entropy, number of nodes/edges, and average PageRank showed correlations with student performance. These metrics changed over time, reflecting development from intermediate to expert-level processing.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that insight into visual expertise acquisition can inform the creation of AI-assisted learning tools, aiding training and expertise development in visual search tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how novices acquire and hone visual search skills is crucial
for developing and optimizing training methods across domains. Network analysis
methods can be used to analyze graph representations of visual expertise. This
study investigates the relationship between eye-gaze movements and learning
outcomes among undergraduate dentistry students who were diagnosing dental
radiographs over multiple semesters. We use network analysis techniques to
model eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network
metrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify
distinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association
with students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network
metric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores,
while the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively
correlated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual
students over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to
expert-level processing. These insights contribute to understanding expertise
acquisition in visual tasks and can inform the design of AI-assisted learning
interventions.

TL;DR: The study reveals humans can only modestly distinguish AI-generated images from real ones, with a 62% success rate, based on an analysis of 287,000 evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how effectively humans can differentiate between real and AI-generated or modified images as AI image generation technology improves.

Method: Participants played an online game, "Real or Not Quiz," evaluating randomized sets of real and AI-generated images for authenticity. The study analyzed 287,000 evaluations by over 12,500 people globally.

Result: The overall success rate of identifying image authenticity was 62%, with participants performing best on human portraits but struggling with landscapes.

Conclusion: The modest success rate highlights the difficulty humans face with detecting AI-generated content and underscores the importance of transparency tools like watermarks and detection systems to combat misinformation risks.

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from
AI-generated content

### [262] [DxHF: Providing High-Quality Human Feedback for LLM Alignment via Interactive Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18802)
*Danqing Shi,Furui Cheng,Tino Weinkauf,Antti Oulasvirta,Mennatallah El-Assady*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper introduces an approach called DxHF to improve human feedback for aligning large language models by breaking down and comparing individual claims, instead of evaluating lengthy blocks of text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback plays a critical role in aligning large language models, but existing interfaces for annotators are cognitively demanding, especially for longer texts. Enhancing human feedback quality is crucial for better AI alignment.

Method: The authors propose the decomposition principle, where textual comparisons are done at the level of individual claims rather than entire paragraphs. They implement this principle in a user interface, DxHF, which organizes and highlights differences between claims.

Result: Evidence from technical evaluations and a study with 160 participants shows that DxHF improves feedback accuracy by approximately 5%, although it increases average feedback time by 18 seconds, with notable gains in situations of user uncertainty.

Conclusion: The decomposition principle and the DxHF interface demonstrate that Human-Computer Interaction approaches can effectively enhance human feedback quality, offering a promising direction for improving human-AI alignment.

Abstract: Human preferences are widely used to align large language models (LLMs)
through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
However, the current user interfaces require annotators to compare text
paragraphs, which is cognitively challenging when the texts are long or
unfamiliar. This paper contributes by studying the decomposition principle as
an approach to improving the quality of human feedback for LLM alignment. This
approach breaks down the text into individual claims instead of directly
comparing two long-form text responses. Based on the principle, we build a
novel user interface DxHF. It enhances the comparison process by showing
decomposed claims, visually encoding the relevance of claims to the
conversation and linking similar claims. This allows users to skim through key
information and identify differences for better and quicker judgment. Our
technical evaluation shows evidence that decomposition generally improves
feedback accuracy regarding the ground truth, particularly for users with
uncertainty. A crowdsourcing study with 160 participants indicates that using
DxHF improves feedback accuracy by an average of 5%, although it increases the
average feedback time by 18 seconds. Notably, accuracy is significantly higher
in situations where users have less certainty. The finding of the study
highlights the potential of HCI as an effective method for improving human-AI
alignment.

### [263] [People Are Highly Cooperative with Large Language Models, Especially When Communication Is Possible or Following Human Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18639)
*Paweł Niszczota,Tomasz Grzegorczyk,Alexander Pastukhov*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explored how interactions with a large language model (LLM) like GPT impact cooperative behavior, using the Prisoner's Dilemma game. LLMs achieved high cooperation rates, though slightly lower than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research investigates how LLMs could augment human capabilities in cooperative settings, particularly in business scenarios requiring effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder trust.

Method: Two experiments were conducted using the Prisoner’s Dilemma game. Experiment 1 involved a repeated 30-round game against a human, LLM, and classic bot. Experiment 2 used a one-shot game with optional communication, pitting participants against either a human or an LLM.

Result: Cooperation rates with LLMs were high but about 10-15 percentage points lower than with humans. Communication increased cooperation equally for both humans and LLMs, and prior interaction with humans boosted cooperation with LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs, like GPT, show promise in fostering cooperation in business contexts, though their impact remains slightly lower than human interactions. Businesses can strategically use LLMs in cooperative settings with careful considerations.

Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment
humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for
business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder
trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human
might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's
Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic
scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round
repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).
In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or
an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling
LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation
rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points
compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This
finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost
of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about
cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the
likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is
particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the
assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines
compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher
following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in
cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by
businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

*Zijian Zhang,Pan Chen,Fangshi Du,Runlong Ye,Oliver Huang,Michael Liut,Alán Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: TreeReader is an interactive tool that converts academic papers into a hierarchical tree structure with LLM-generated summaries, allowing focused navigation and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional formats like PDF hinder academic paper navigation and comprehension due to linearity and cognitive overload. LLM chatbots for summarization lack nuanced understanding and reliable document structure representation.

Method: The TreeReader tool uses a hierarchical tree format with LLM-generated summaries for each section. Users can interactively access detailed content, enabling efficient comprehension and verification.

Result: User studies showed that TreeReader improves reading efficiency and comprehension of complex academic literature.

Conclusion: TreeReader bridges hierarchical summarization and interactive exploration, enhancing navigation and understanding of academic papers.

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for
scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause
cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it
difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer
summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may
produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's
navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic
reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented
paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure
where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise
summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users
to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and
verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to
evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension.
TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand
complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with
interactive exploration.

Motivation: Address the challenges of high complexity and computational cost in large-scale speech-to-speech systems, particularly for high-time-dimensional codecs with multiple quantizers.

Method: Introduces HH-Codec, which employs a Vector Quantization space designed for spoken language, along with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture called Audio-VQ-Mel-Audio, enabling efficient compression and stable reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech reconstruction at 0.3 kbps, with effective codebook utilization and generative model compatibility validated through extensive ablations.

Conclusion: HH-Codec offers an efficient solution for low-bandwidth, high-quality speech encoding, demonstrating its potential in speech-to-speech systems with its robust and innovative architecture.

Abstract: Discrete speech tokenization is a fundamental component in speech codecs.
However, in large-scale speech-to-speech systems, the complexity of parallel
streams from multiple quantizers and the computational cost of
high-time-dimensional codecs pose significant challenges. In this paper, we
introduce HH-Codec, a neural codec that achieves extreme compression at 24
tokens per second for 24 kHz audio while relying on single-quantizer inference.
Our approach involves a carefully designed Vector Quantization space for Spoken
Language Modeling, optimizing compression efficiency while minimizing
information loss. Building on this, we propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder
architecture (Audio-VQ-Mel-Audio) that leverages dual supervision and
progressive training to enhance reconstruction stability and fidelity. HH-Codec
achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech reconstruction with an
ultra-low bandwidth of 0.3 kbps. We further evaluate its effectiveness in
codebook utilization and generative model adaptation, with extensive ablations
validating the necessity of each module. HH-Codec is available at

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper investigates how leveraging multiple input modalities can enhance automatic speech recognition (ASR) in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the conditions and architecture designs under which combining various input modalities improves ASR accuracy, especially in noisy settings.

Method: The study involved experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets, analyzing the impact of different modalities (e.g., synchronized lip movements, unsynchronized image context) and factors like the quality of visual representations, input order, and model weights.

Result: (1) Combining multiple modalities improves ASR accuracy based on noise level. (2) Synchronized modalities are effective in high noise levels, while unsynchronized ones help at moderate noise levels. (3) High-quality visual representations consistently improve performance. (4) Mamba and Transformers share similar trends in multimodality advantages. (5) Modality order and weight allocation significantly impact accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for improving ASR systems in noisy conditions and advance the understanding of multi-modal approaches for speech recognition.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other
modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and
model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic
speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities
usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary
information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2)
Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise
levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful
at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations
consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing
more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the
benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities
as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact
accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our
understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for audio resynthesis using granular synthesis in latent vector space, producing audio that combines the temporal structure of a target with the timbral characteristics of a source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve audio resynthesis techniques by removing training requirements and avoiding common issues like discontinuities.

Method: Source audio is encoded into latent vector segments as a granular codebook. Target audio grains are matched with nearest codebook counterparts and reassembled into new audio, leveraging codec decoding for seamless interpolation.

Result: The approach effectively synthesizes audio with mixed temporal and timbral features while handling diverse audio types without needing model training.

Conclusion: The technique offers a novel way to combine audio characteristics and avoids typical concatenative synthesis issues, making it a flexible and practical solution for creative applications.

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates
by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our
approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into
latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal
to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is
decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while
adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model
training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the
discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the
codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary
material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a
proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own
sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .

TL;DR: A novel framework, Face2VoiceSync, is introduced to generate synchronized talking face animation and corresponding speech from a face image and text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for speech-driven talking face generation are limited by fixed-driven speech and lack adaptability, causing issues like face-voice mismatch.

Method: Face2VoiceSync incorporates voice-face alignment, paralinguistic feature control, lightweight VAE for efficient training, and proposes a new evaluation metric.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performances for both visual and audio outputs on a 40GB GPU.

Conclusion: Face2VoiceSync extends talking face generation tasks by generating synchronized voices and animations with improved alignment and efficiency while introducing new evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising
results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications
(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging
setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face
animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and
audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters
than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity
and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual
and audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS), focusing on real-time user interruptions and scenario robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation metrics for full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, particularly under scenarios involving real-time user interruptions and challenging conditions.

Method: They developed a benchmarking pipeline that uses LLMs, TTS, and ASR to simulate interactions and evaluate FDSDS across various metrics, including interruptions and noise handling.

Result: The study applied the benchmark to three open-source FDSDS models using 40 hours of speech and 1,200 interruptions, identifying challenges like poor handling of interruptions and noise.

Conclusion: Current FDSDS models struggle with user interruptions and noisy conditions, requiring improvements in robustness. Data, code, and demonstrations will be released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) enable more natural human-machine
interactions by allowing real-time user interruptions and backchanneling,
compared to traditional SDS that rely on turn-taking. However, existing
benchmarks lack metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance
during user interruptions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD
benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap. It
assesses FDSDS's ability to handle user interruptions, manage delays, and
maintain robustness in challenging scenarios with diverse novel metrics. We
applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and
VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated
conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models
continue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions,
under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions. Demonstrations, data, and code

*Simon Malan,Benjamin van Niekerk,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper examines bottom-up and top-down approaches for segmenting and clustering speech data, achieving comparable results but highlighting clustering as the limiting factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether top-down information is essential for improving speech segmentation and clustering.

Method: The paper compares two methods: a bottom-up approach using adjacent feature dissimilarity for segmentation and clustering, and a top-down ES-KMeans dynamic programming method combining clustering with boundary adjustment.

Result: Both approaches achieve state-of-the-art results on the ZeroSpeech benchmarks, with the bottom-up method being faster. Top-down influence is impactful in some cases, but clustering techniques remain a bottleneck for both methods.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on enhanced clustering techniques and learning better word-like representations to improve segmentation and clustering outcomes.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like
units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized
into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then
cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods
incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.
However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve
segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in
whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up
strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent
self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a
lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic
programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On
the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable
state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times
faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of
ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate
boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as
well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.
Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering
techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations. Project

### [272] [Assessment of Personality Dimensions Across Situations Using Conversational Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19137)
*Alice Zhang,Skanda Muralidhar,Daniel Gatica-Perez,Mathew Magimai-Doss*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This study explores the connection between conversational speech and perceived personality traits across neutral and stressful work interactions, finding that personality varies significantly with context and identifying impactful acoustic and non-verbal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how perceived personality traits, which often vary by context, relate to conversational speech in different work situations.

Method: Analyzed conversational speech during two types of work situations: neutral interviews and stressful client interactions, using acoustic, spectral, and non-verbal features.

Result: Key findings include differences in perceived personality traits across contexts, specific acoustic features correlating with traits, and stressful interactions predicting neuroticism better.

Conclusion: Perceived personalities are context-dependent, and certain features allow for better prediction of traits, with stressful situations offering unique insights into neuroticism.

Abstract: Prior research indicates that users prefer assistive technologies whose
personalities align with their own. This has sparked interest in automatic
personality perception (APP), which aims to predict an individual's perceived
personality traits. Previous studies in APP have treated personalities as
static traits, independent of context. However, perceived personalities can
vary by context and situation as shown in psychological research. In this
study, we investigate the relationship between conversational speech and
perceived personality for participants engaged in two work situations (a
neutral interview and a stressful client interaction). Our key findings are: 1)
perceived personalities differ significantly across interactions, 2) loudness,
sound level, and spectral flux features are indicative of perceived
extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness in neutral
interactions, while neuroticism correlates with these features in stressful
contexts, 3) handcrafted acoustic features and non-verbal features outperform
speaker embeddings in inference of perceived personality, and 4) stressful
interactions are more predictive of neuroticism, aligning with existing
psychological research.

### [273] [Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19093)
*Antonio Tudisco,Deborah Volpe,Giacomo Orlandi,Giovanna Turvani*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model for predicting the best quantum hardware to execute circuits without computationally expensive evaluations, outperforming traditional brute-force compilation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of diverse quantum hardware technologies with varying connectivity and native gate sets creates challenges in identifying the most suitable platform for executing specific quantum circuits efficiently.

Method: A GNN-based predictor is developed to analyze the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of quantum circuits, avoiding the extraction of explicit features and directly embedding the graph for evaluation.

Result: On evaluating 498 quantum circuits across four devices, the method achieved a 94.4% prediction accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively automating hardware selection.

Conclusion: The approach significantly accelerates the decision-making process for selecting optimal quantum hardware, proves effective on experimental evaluation, and is publicly open-source for community adoption and further research.

Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique
peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges
when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This
selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the
circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as
circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally
expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors
increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498
quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using
Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,
IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).
Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate
fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on
the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting
platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids
extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it
as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making
process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%
accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting
the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub
(https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).

Result: Experimental results show that PGKET surpasses some state-of-the-art transformers in classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: PGKET not only achieves higher performance in specific tasks but also holds potential for improving machine learning convergence in photonic computing.

Abstract: Self-Attention Mechanisms (SAMs) enhance model performance by extracting key
information but are inefficient when dealing with long sequences. To this end,
a photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer (PGKET) is proposed, based on
the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (PGKSAM). The PGKSAM
calculates the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Score (PGKSAS) using
photon interferometry and superposition to process multiple inputs in parallel.
Experimental results show that PGKET outperforms some state-of-the-art
transformers in multi-classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10, and is
expected to improve performance in complex tasks and accelerate the convergence
of Photonic Computing (PC) and machine learning.

TL;DR: This paper extends Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to handle matrix-valued data using a nonparametric empirical Bayes framework, showing improved classification performance in applications like neuroimaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address classification problems involving matrix-valued data commonly found in areas like neuroimaging, where structural information in the data needs effective utilization.

Method: A novel Fisher's LDA extension for matrix-valued data is developed using a Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NPMLE) approach. This method efficiently vectorizes and scales matrix data to enhance estimation flexibility.

Result: Simulation studies and real-world applications to EEG and MRI data demonstrate superior classification performance compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures structural information in matrix-valued data, offering robust and accurate classification, outperforming existing techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses classification problems with matrix-valued data, which
commonly arises in applications such as neuroimaging and signal processing.
Building on the assumption that the data from each class follows a matrix
normal distribution, we propose a novel extension of Fisher's Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) tailored for matrix-valued observations. To
effectively capture structural information while maintaining estimation
flexibility, we adopt a nonparametric empirical Bayes framework based on
Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NPMLE), applied to vectorized and
scaled matrices. The NPMLE method has been shown to provide robust, flexible,
and accurate estimates for vector-valued data with various structures in the
mean vector or covariance matrix. By leveraging its strengths, our method is
effectively generalized to the matrix setting, thereby improving classification
performance. Through extensive simulation studies and real data applications,
including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
existing approaches across a variety of data structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide comparative evidence on the prevalence of and audience engagement with negative political and non-political news posts on social media.

Method: Analyzed 6,081,134 Facebook posts across six countries and developed multilingual classifiers to categorize content as political/non-political and negative/non-negative.

Result: Found that 12.6% of posts are negative; political posts are not more negative than non-political posts; U.S. political posts are 40% less negative than other countries; negative posts get fewer likes (15%) and comments (13%).

Conclusion: Negative news posts constitute a small portion of content and user engagement, challenging perceptions of negativity dominance in social media news.

Abstract: Although news negativity is often studied, missing is comparative evidence on
the prevalence of and engagement with negative political and non-political news
posts on social media. We use 6,081,134 Facebook posts published between
January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, by 97 media organizations in six countries
(U.S., UK, Ireland, Poland, France, Spain) and develop two multilingual
classifiers for labeling posts as (non-)political and (non-)negative. We show
that: (1) negative news posts constitute a relatively small fraction (12.6%);
(2) political news posts are neither more nor less negative than non-political
news posts; (3) U.S. political news posts are less negative relative to the
other countries on average (40% lower odds); (4) Negative news posts get 15%
fewer likes and 13% fewer comments than non-negative news posts. Lastly, (5) we
provide estimates of the proportion of the total volume of user engagement with
negative news posts and show that only between 10.2% to 13.1% of engagement is
linked to negative posts by the analyzed news organizations.

*Sungjun Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Extended Neural Adjoint (ENA) framework for inversely designing optical multilayer thin films, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in inverse design for optical multilayer thin films by improving accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability in current neural adjoint methods.

Method: The proposed ENA framework includes a novel forward neural network architecture, a material loss function, and a feature visualization method termed F-RAM for enhanced scalability and interpretability.

Result: Experiments show the material loss function improves accuracy and diversity significantly, and the ENA outperforms existing methods in accuracy and diversity. F-RAM demonstrates consistent feature importance across different film configurations.

Conclusion: The ENA framework is more versatile, accurate, and interpretable than existing methods for designing optical multilayer thin films, with demonstrated flexibility and enhanced functionalities.

Abstract: We propose an extended neural adjoint (ENA) framework, which meets six key
criteria for artificial intelligence-assisted inverse design of optical
multilayer thin films (OMTs): accuracy, efficiency, diversity, scalability,
flexibility, and interpretability. To enhance the scalability of the existing
neural adjoint method, we present a novel forward neural network architecture
for OMTs and introduce a material loss function into the existing neural
adjoint loss function, facilitating the exploration of material configurations
of OMTs. Furthermore, we present the detailed formulation of the regression
activation mapping for the presented forward neural network architecture
(F-RAM), a feature visualization method aimed at improving interpretability. We
validated the efficacy of the material loss by conducting an ablation study,
where each component of the loss function is systematically removed and
evaluated. The results indicated that the inclusion of the material loss
significantly improves accuracy and diversity. To substantiate the performance
of the ENA-based inverse design, we compared it against the residual
network-based global optimization network (Res-GLOnet). The ENA yielded the OMT
solutions of an inverse design with higher accuracy and better diversity
compared to the Res-GLOnet. To demonstrate the interpretability, we applied
F-RAM to diverse OMT structures with similar optical properties, obtained by
the proposed ENA method. We showed that distributions of feature importance for
various OMT structures exhibiting analogous optical properties are consistent,
despite variations in material configurations, layer number, and thicknesses.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ENA method by restricting
the initial layer of OMTs to SiO2 and 100 nm.

*Takuya Inoue,Takuya Kawabata*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This work combines CNNs with ensemble NWP models to improve medium-range temperature forecasts by reducing systematic and random errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of low-resolution NWP models, which are prone to systematic and random errors, especially when operational centers have limited computational resources.

Method: The method employs CNN-based post-processing for bias correction and super-resolution on each ensemble member, followed by ensemble averaging to reduce random errors.

Result: The study found that CNN correction followed by ensemble averaging achieved higher accuracy than the reverse. The method outperformed high-resolution deterministic NWP models.

Conclusion: The method is scalable and effective for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, making it valuable for resource-constrained operational centers.

Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling
surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day)
forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational
medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models,
which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations,
the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based
post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble
member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution
model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of
the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of
CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For
comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with
the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN
correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy
than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts,
the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP
models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with
ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in
NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution
for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable
at operational centers with limited computational resources.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two regional machine learning weather prediction models, LAM and SGM, based on their design and performance over Europe. Both show comparable accuracy, but each has distinct strengths depending on the application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to analyze the impact of model design (LAM and SGM) on forecasting performance to guide the selection of suitable approaches for operational weather prediction.

Method: Using the Anemoi framework, comparable LAM and SGM models were built and trained with global and regional reanalysis data. Inference experiments compared their performance and highlighted application-specific strengths and weaknesses.

Result: Both models deliver accurate deterministic forecasts, but LAM relies on quality boundary forcings and is beneficial when global data is limited. SGM is self-contained, uses more training data, and demonstrates superior temporal generalizability.

Conclusion: The study serves as a guide for meteorological institutes in choosing between LAM and SGM for developing efficient data-driven forecasting systems.

Abstract: Regional machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) models based on graph
neural networks have recently demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy,
outperforming numerical weather prediction models at lower computational costs.
In particular, limited-area model (LAM) and stretched-grid model (SGM)
approaches have emerged for generating high-resolution regional forecasts,
based on initial conditions from a regional (re)analysis. While LAM uses
lateral boundaries from an external global model, SGM incorporates a global
domain at lower resolution. This study aims to understand how the differences
in model design impact relative performance and potential applications.
Specifically, the strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches are
identified for generating deterministic regional forecasts over Europe. Using
the Anemoi framework, models of both types are built by minimally adapting a
shared architecture and trained using global and regional reanalyses in a
near-identical setup. Several inference experiments have been conducted to
explore their relative performance and highlight key differences. Results show
that both LAM and SGM are competitive deterministic MLWP models with generally
accurate and comparable forecasting performance over the regional domain.
Various differences were identified in the performance of the models across
applications. LAM is able to successfully exploit high-quality boundary
forcings to make predictions within the regional domain and is suitable in
contexts where global data is difficult to acquire. SGM is fully self-contained
for easier operationalisation, can take advantage of more training data and
significantly surpasses LAM in terms of (temporal) generalisability. Our paper
can serve as a starting point for meteorological institutes to guide their
choice between LAM and SGM in developing an operational data-driven forecasting
system.

### [280] [The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02945)
*Egil Diau*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper introduces a behavioral model for reciprocal exchange as the foundational economic principle, challenging the myth of barter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve the gap in understanding the origins of economic behavior and create a simulateable account of reciprocity as opposed to barter.

Method: It develops a framework based on three cognitive primitives: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost-return sensitivity.

Result: This model enables the emergence of cooperation and economic structures from basic reciprocal interactions.

Conclusion: The framework bridges multiple disciplines to model foundational economic behavior in humans and AI systems, offering insights into trust and coordination.

Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social
sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined
incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of
barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human
societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic
logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before
formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a
simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal
behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive
primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return
sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal
exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These
mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and
institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from
primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this
framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and
economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.

*Abishek Shrestha,Damith Herath,Angie Fearon,Maryam Ghahramani*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel, portable Balance Mat (BM) for postural sway assessment, using robot and human studies while comparing its performance to the gold-standard force plates (FP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a portable, low-cost, and user-friendly device to assess postural sway, as current gold-standard force plates have limitations like being non-portable and requiring high expertise.

Method: The study used a robot study with a UR10 robotic arm for controlled sway tests and a human study with 51 participants performing balance tasks on both the BM and the FP. Metrics were compared, ICC values calculated, and calibration was applied to improve agreement.

Result: The BM showed good to excellent reliability in the robot study and moderate to strong correlations with FP in the human study. However, BM initially overestimated sway metrics as compared to FP, which was improved via calibration.

Conclusion: The Balance Mat is a reliable and valid portable alternative for postural sway assessment, demonstrating consistent performance across stance conditions after calibration.

Abstract: Postural sway assessment is important for detecting balance problems and
identifying people at risk of falls. Force plates (FP) are considered the gold
standard postural sway assessment method in laboratory conditions, but their
lack of portability and requirement of high-level expertise limit their
widespread usage. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel
Balance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical
fibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human
study. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled
sway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human
study, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in
combination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway
mean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range,
and sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability
was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values
greater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were
considered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent
ICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed
moderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman
plots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the
FP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP. Calibration was
used to improve the agreement between the devices. The device demonstrated
consistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both
reliability and validity following appropriate calibration.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel framework for multiresolution analysis of graph signals using samplets, showing enhanced compression and analysis capabilities over classical Haar wavelets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient compression and analysis of graph signals, a method akin to wavelet transforms tailored for scattered data was needed, especially one that addresses the limitations of classical Haar wavelets.

Method: The proposed method constructs samplets by partitioning a graph into patches, embedding those patches in Euclidean space, constructing wavelet-like samplets there, and pulling them back to the graph, while preserving essential properties such as orthogonality and locality.

Result: The approach is robust, scalable, and capable of yielding sparse representations with controllable approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelets in compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework broadens the analytical and compression capabilities for graph signals, ensuring efficient, accurate, and scalable processing of data on graphs.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph
signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined
in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to
the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining
samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of
patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets,
and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures
orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to
properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar
wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can
efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a
definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction.
We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs
whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation,
we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful
patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional
embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness,
scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable
approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet
approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PurpCode, a training method for enhancing cybersecurity in code reasoning models, through rule learning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cybersecurity risks posed by code reasoning models and improve their ability to generate secure and utility-preserving code.

Method: The approach involves a two-stage training recipe: teaching cybersafety rules (Rule Learning) and optimizing safety and utility via reinforcement learning. The process is supported by internal red-teaming for generating realistic prompts inducing unsafe responses.

Result: The PurpCode-32B model trained with this method achieves state-of-the-art cybersafety performance while reducing overrefusal and maintaining effectiveness in code generation and security knowledge.

Conclusion: PurpCode provides a robust framework to train reasoning models that generate secure code and mitigate malicious cyberactivities without sacrificing utility or efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code
reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious
cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule
Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to
generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious
cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety
and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms.
To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we
conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage
prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the
model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely
PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming
various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model
overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while
preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarks cannot adequately address emerging LLM vulnerabilities discussed in online communities, necessitating a dynamic approach to security monitoring.

Method: The study utilizes PrompTrend, a system that collects and evaluates vulnerabilities via multidimensional scoring across platforms, alongside cross-sectional testing on nine commercial LLMs over five months.

Result: Analysis of 198 vulnerabilities finds correlations between advanced capabilities and increased susceptibility, predominance of psychological attacks, and notable variations in attack effectiveness across platforms and models. The framework achieves 78% classification accuracy.

Conclusion: Effective LLM security requires ongoing socio-technical assessments as vulnerabilities often stem from community interactions, challenging the notion that improved capabilities inherently enhance security.

Abstract: Static benchmarks fail to capture LLM vulnerabilities emerging through
community experimentation in online forums. We present PrompTrend, a system
that collects vulnerability data across platforms and evaluates them using
multidimensional scoring, with an architecture designed for scalable
monitoring. Cross-sectional analysis of 198 vulnerabilities collected from
online communities over a five-month period (January-May 2025) and tested on
nine commercial models reveals that advanced capabilities correlate with
increased vulnerability in some architectures, psychological attacks
significantly outperform technical exploits, and platform dynamics shape attack
effectiveness with measurable model-specific patterns. The PrompTrend
Vulnerability Assessment Framework achieves 78% classification accuracy while
revealing limited cross-model transferability, demonstrating that effective LLM
security requires comprehensive socio-technical monitoring beyond traditional
periodic assessment. Our findings challenge the assumption that capability
advancement improves security and establish community-driven psychological
manipulation as the dominant threat vector for current language models.

Motivation: Large language models now integrate code interpreters, enabling advanced functionalities. However, this feature also introduces novel system-level cybersecurity risks, necessitating a systematic method to evaluate and mitigate these threats.

Method: The authors designed CIRCLE, a benchmark with prompts that test CPU, memory, and disk exploitation via direct and indirect methods. They used an automated evaluation to test refusal of risky code, execution safety, correctness, and runtime behavior across 7 commercially available models.

Result: Testing exposed notable vulnerabilities in both OpenAI and Google models, with varying defenses. For example, OpenAI's o4-mini refused risky prompts 7.1% of the time compared to GPT-4.1's 0.5%. Indirect prompts were found to significantly weaken defenses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that interpreter-based LLM risks are significant and inconsistent across models, underscoring the need for dedicated cybersecurity benchmarks, mitigation tools, and industry standards to safeguard such integrations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate native code
interpreters, they enable powerful real-time execution capabilities,
substantially expanding their utility. However, such integrations introduce
potential system-level cybersecurity threats, fundamentally different from
prompt-based vulnerabilities. To systematically evaluate these
interpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience
Check for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting
CPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes
explicitly malicious ("direct") and plausibly benign ("indirect") prompt
variants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs
refuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the
interpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by
the LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially
available models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and
inconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial
disparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky
requests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%. Results
particularly underscore that indirect, socially-engineered prompts
substantially weaken model defenses. This highlights an urgent need for
interpreter-specific cybersecurity benchmarks, dedicated mitigation tools
(e.g., guardrails), and clear industry standards to guide safe and responsible
deployment of LLM interpreter integrations. The benchmark dataset and
evaluation code are publicly released to foster further research.

### [287] [PBiLoss: Popularity-Aware Regularization to Improve Fairness in Graph-Based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19067)
*Mohammad Naeimi,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces PBiLoss, a novel loss function designed to address popularity bias in graph neural network-based recommender systems by penalizing preferences for popular items while maintaining performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems struggle with popularity bias, often over-recommending popular items, which compromises fairness and content diversity.

Method: The authors propose PBiLoss, a regularization-based loss function, combined with two sampling strategies (PopPos and PopNeg) and item-distinction methods (fixed threshold or adaptive). The approach is model-agnostic and tested on frameworks like LightGCN.

Result: Experiments with real-world datasets reveal that PBiLoss enhances fairness measures (lower PRU and PRI) without sacrificing recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics.

Conclusion: Embedding fairness objectives like PBiLoss into optimization processes provides a scalable and practical method to balance recommendation accuracy with diverse and equitable content exposure.

Abstract: Recommender systems, especially those based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
have achieved remarkable success in capturing user-item interaction patterns.
However, they remain susceptible to popularity bias--the tendency to
over-recommend popular items--resulting in reduced content diversity and
compromised fairness. In this paper, we propose PBiLoss, a novel
regularization-based loss function designed to counteract popularity bias in
graph-based recommender models explicitly. PBiLoss augments traditional
training objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,
thereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more
personalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive
(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the
contribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We
further explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed
popularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach
flexible and adaptive. Our proposed method is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art graph-based frameworks such as
LightGCN and its variants. Comprehensive experiments across multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that PBiLoss significantly improves fairness, as
demonstrated by reductions in the Popularity-Rank Correlation for Users (PRU)
and Popularity-Rank Correlation for Items (PRI), while maintaining or even
enhancing standard recommendation accuracy and ranking metrics. These results
highlight the effectiveness of directly embedding fairness objectives into the
optimization process, providing a practical and scalable solution for balancing
accuracy and equitable content exposure in modern recommender systems.

### [289] [Distilling a Small Utility-Based Passage Selector to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19102)
*Hengran Zhang,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Jiaming Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method that distills the utility judgment capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into smaller models to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods for RAG are computationally expensive and focus on the relevance of passages rather than their utility for answering complex queries.

Method: The authors train smaller models to mimic the utility judgment of LLMs by using pseudo-answer generation and a sliding window method to dynamically select useful passages.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method reduces computational costs and improves answer quality. Utility-based selection outperformed relevance ranking in handling complex queries.

Conclusion: Distilled models with utility-based selection have significant potential for improving RAG by balancing performance and efficiency, with annotations provided for further research.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

### [290] [Injecting External Knowledge into the Reasoning Process Enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19333)
*Minghao Tang,Shiyu Ni,Jiafeng Guo,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Passage Injection, a method to improve the robustness of RAG systems by incorporating retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of noisy retrieved passages that negatively impact the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

Method: The proposed method, Passage Injection, embeds retrieved passages directly into the reasoning process of LLMs to help them recognize and resist noisy input.

Result: Experiments across four factual QA datasets and noisy retrieval settings show that Passage Injection improves RAG performance and robustness compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process is a promising approach to enhance the reliability of RAG systems, as demonstrated by Passage Injection's success in various settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

*M. Jeffrey Mei,Florian Henkel,Samuel E. Sandberg,Oliver Bembom,Andreas F. Ehmann*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of shared content-based embeddings to reduce model size, enhance recommendation accuracy and diversity in next-item recommendation tasks, with experiments on music datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of large memory demands in training recommender systems by utilizing content-based shared embeddings instead of unique embeddings for each item.

Method: Proposes leveraging shared content-based embeddings ('semantic IDs') to replace or supplement unique item embeddings in recommendation models. Experiments are conducted on music datasets, including an online A/B test.

Result: Demonstrates that shared embedding approaches improve recommendation accuracy and diversity while significantly reducing the model size.

Conclusion: Utilizing content-based shared embeddings proves to be an effective strategy for lightweight, accurate, and diverse recommender systems, as shown through both offline and online results.

Abstract: Training recommender systems for next-item recommendation often requires
unique embeddings to be learned for each item, which may take up most of the
trainable parameters for a model. Shared embeddings, such as using content
information, can reduce the number of distinct embeddings to be stored in
memory. This allows for a more lightweight model; correspondingly, model
complexity can be increased due to having fewer embeddings to store in memory.
We show the benefit of using shared content-based features ('semantic IDs') in
improving recommendation accuracy and diversity, while reducing model size, for
two music recommendation datasets, including an online A/B test on a music
streaming service.

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing group recommender systems by addressing group dynamics, decision-making, suitability, and explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group recommender systems involve challenges like social dependencies and group-level decision-making, necessitating innovative approaches to improve their functionality.

Method: The authors analyze how large language models can contribute to key aspects such as understanding group dynamics, ensuring suitability of recommendations, and generating explanations for both groups and individuals.

Result: The study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in improving decision support quality and the applicability of group recommender systems.

Conclusion: Large language models are a promising tool to tackle the complexities specific to group recommender systems, improving their relevance and usability for collective decision-making.

Abstract: In contrast to single-user recommender systems, group recommender systems are
designed to generate and explain recommendations for groups. This
group-oriented setting introduces additional complexities, as several factors -
absent in individual contexts - must be addressed. These include understanding
group dynamics (e.g., social dependencies within the group), defining effective
decision-making processes, ensuring that recommendations are suitable for all
group members, and providing group-level explanations as well as explanations
for individual users. In this paper, we analyze in which way large language
models (LLMs) can support these aspects and help to increase the overall
decision support quality and applicability of group recommender systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Agent0', an LLM-driven agent-based system for automating information extraction and feature construction from unstructured text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems need automated and efficient ways to extract valuable categorical features, which are typically expensive to acquire manually.

Method: The study leverages interacting LLM agents in Agent0 to automatically identify valuable textual aspects and incorporates automated prompt-engineering using dynamic feedback loops from an oracle.

Result: The research shows that the proposed closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective for automated feature discovery in recommender systems.

Conclusion: Agent0 effectively facilitates automated feature discovery and engineering, streamlining one of the most complex phases in recommender system development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their associated agent-based frameworks have
significantly advanced automated information extraction, a critical component
of modern recommender systems. While these multitask frameworks are widely used
in code generation, their application in data-centric research is still largely
untapped. This paper presents Agent0, an LLM-driven, agent-based system
designed to automate information extraction and feature construction from raw,
unstructured text. Categorical features are crucial for large-scale recommender
systems but are often expensive to acquire. Agent0 coordinates a group of
interacting LLM agents to automatically identify the most valuable text aspects
for subsequent tasks (such as models or AutoML pipelines). Beyond its feature
engineering capabilities, Agent0 also offers an automated prompt-engineering
tuning method that utilizes dynamic feedback loops from an oracle. Our findings
demonstrate that this closed-loop methodology is both practical and effective
for automated feature discovery, which is recognized as one of the most
challenging phases in current recommender system development.

*Anton Pembek,Artem Fatkulin,Anton Klenitskiy,Alexey Vasilev*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to address cold-start problems in sequential recommender systems by introducing small trainable adjustments (delta) to frozen content embeddings, improving adaptability without distorting the original semantic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the cold-start problem in recommender systems, where items with minimal or no interactions struggle to generate trained embeddings effectively.

Method: Introduce a trainable delta to frozen content embeddings, enabling controlled adaptation of item representations without extensive fine-tuning or freezing.

Result: The approach showed consistent performance improvements across various datasets, including e-commerce and music datasets.

Conclusion: The novel method effectively balances adaptability and preservation of semantic structure in embeddings, mitigating cold-start problems in recommender systems.

Abstract: Many sequential recommender systems suffer from the cold start problem, where
items with few or no interactions cannot be effectively used by the model due
to the absence of a trained embedding. Content-based approaches, which leverage
item metadata, are commonly used in such scenarios. One possible way is to use
embeddings derived from content features such as textual descriptions as
initialization for the model embeddings. However, directly using frozen content
embeddings often results in suboptimal performance, as they may not fully adapt
to the recommendation task. On the other hand, fine-tuning these embeddings can
degrade performance for cold-start items, as item representations may drift far
from their original structure after training. We propose a novel approach to
address this limitation. Instead of entirely freezing the content embeddings or
fine-tuning them extensively, we introduce a small trainable delta to frozen
embeddings that enables the model to adapt item representations without letting
them go too far from their original semantic structure. This approach
demonstrates consistent improvements across multiple datasets and modalities,
including e-commerce datasets with textual descriptions and a music dataset
with audio-based representation.

### [295] [Discovering the dynamics of \emph{Sargassum} rafts' centers of mass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18771)
*Francisco J. Beron-Vera,Gage Bonner*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper explores methods to predict the motion of floating Sargassum seaweed rafts using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of a predictive law for the center of mass of Sargassum rafts necessitates innovative approaches, such as machine learning, to address the problem.

Method: The study employs two methodologies: (1) LSTM to learn mappings of eBOMB variables to raft dynamics and (2) SINDy for explicit relationships modeled via custom function libraries suggested by eBOMB dynamics.

Result: Both methods show optimal performance in tightly bonded clumps but face challenges in complex scenarios like wind effects or loosely connected clumps. LSTM performs best with simplified designs; SINDy provides interpretability and excels in handling sparsely connected rafts.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the trade-offs between LSTM's high performance and lack of interpretability and SINDy’s transparent yet sometimes less precise modeling. Windowed velocity terms introduced in SINDy improve modeling of nonlocal effects for sparse datasets.

Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently
obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is
represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as
the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating
interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects
of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of
mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and
contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and
Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a
physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB.
Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB
variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities.
The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB
variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects
of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in
conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising
complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected
clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were
straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves
as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings
transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the
function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled
effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring
sparsely connected rafts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address restrictions and inaccuracies in chi-squared minimization techniques for resonance parameter estimation when models are misspecified.

Method: The authors conducted a case study on pi-pi scattering and the rho(770) resonance, comparing predictions between models derived from chi-squared minimization and SBI.

Result: SBI provided more robust predictions for rho(770) pole positions, highlighting its ability to handle model misspecification effectively.

Conclusion: SBI is a viable and superior alternative to chi-squared minimization under certain conditions, with implications for modeling pi-pi scattering in physical systems.

Abstract: Simulation Based Inference (SBI) is shown to yield more accurate resonance
parameter estimates than traditional chi-squared minimization in certain cases
of model misspecification, demonstrated through a case study of pi-pi
scattering and the rho(770) resonance. Models fit to some data sets using
chi-squared minimization can predict inaccurate pole positions for the
rho(770), while SBI provides more robust predictions across the same models and
data. This result is significant both as a proof of concept that SBI can handle
model misspecification, and because accurate modeling of pi-pi scattering is
essential in the study of many contemporary physical systems (e.g., a1(1260),
omega(782)).

TL;DR: The paper explores controlling topological defects in active fluids using reinforcement learning and hydrodynamic modeling to enable defect transport along defined paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active polar fluids involve complex non-equilibrium dynamics and controlling topological defects within them is key for designing adaptive and self-organizing materials.

Method: A hydrodynamic model is used to simulate closed-loop control of defects by modulating activity profiles. Reinforcement learning is employed to identify effective strategies for defect manipulation.

Result: Localized control of active stresses reposition defects, allowing for robust transport along both trained and novel paths. Machine learning effectively learns and exploits system dynamics for this purpose.

Conclusion: AI-driven control strategies can dynamically guide active matter, opening avenues in material design and understanding active fluid controllability.

Abstract: Topological defects in active polar fluids exhibit complex dynamics driven by
internally generated stresses, reflecting the deep interplay between topology,
flow, and non-equilibrium hydrodynamics. Feedback control offers a powerful
means to guide such systems, enabling transitions between dynamic states. We
investigated closed-loop steering of integer-charged defects in a confined
active fluid by modulating the spatial profile of activity. Using a continuum
hydrodynamic model, we show that localized control of active stress induces
flow fields that can reposition and direct defects along prescribed
trajectories by exploiting non-linear couplings in the system. A reinforcement
learning framework is used to discover effective control strategies that
produce robust defect transport across both trained and novel trajectories. The
results highlight how AI agents can learn the underlying dynamics and spatially
structure activity to manipulate topological excitations, offering insights
into the controllability of active matter and the design of adaptive,
self-organized materials.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children

In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual

TL;DR: The study introduces a trained autoencoder to enhance single-pixel fluorescence microscopy, allowing faster, better image reconstruction with multispectral capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reconstruction speed, quality, and compression in single-pixel fluorescence microscopy by using learned measurement vectors.

Method: The authors use a self-supervised autoencoder to learn an encoder (measurement matrix) and a decoder to replace traditional total variation minimization techniques.

Result: The method offers two orders of magnitude faster image reconstruction while achieving better quality and enabling multispectral imaging.

Conclusion: Learned single-pixel imaging could significantly reduce costs while advancing diagnosis and biological research through improved multispectral fluorescence microscopy.

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: The paper proposes image-to-image diffusion models to improve the realism and detail of generated brain MRI images by enhancing edges, textures, and noise, addressing limitations of latent diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of overly smooth generated brain MRI images from latent diffusion models, which lack fine anatomical structures and realistic imaging noise.

Method: The authors developed image-to-image diffusion models refining latent diffusion model outputs to add sharp edges, fine textures, and anatomical details. They assess results using metrics like FID, LPIPS, and new measures like noise distribution and texture realism.

Result: The proposed method, RealDeal, enhances the realism of LDM-generated brain MRI images, as demonstrated using both common and new evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: RealDeal successfully addresses the limitations of latent diffusion models by improving image realism, sharpness, and anatomical detail in generated MRI scans.

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

TL;DR: The paper proposes adaptations to post-processing techniques for needle reconstruction in brachytherapy, tackling segmentation errors to improve reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation errors in automatic needle reconstruction for brachytherapy can hinder accurate needle localization, posing challenges for medical treatment planning.

Method: The paper adapts existing post-processing techniques to manage segmentation errors from deep learning-based segmentation during needle reconstruction.

Result: On a prostate cancer MRI dataset, the adapted techniques achieved high accuracy with errors as low as 1.07 mm for needle-tip localization, 0.43 mm for needle-bottom points, and 0.75 mm for shaft errors, with no false positives or negatives.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptations improve robustness and precision in needle reconstruction pipelines, aiding effective brachytherapy planning.

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

*Jitindra Fartiyal,Pedro Freire,Yasmeen Whayeb,James S. Wolffsohn,Sergei K. Turitsyn,Sergei G. Sokolov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) for denoising medical images, combining noise and context information, and shows improved performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing medical image denoising methods, which typically rely on either noise characteristics or contextual image information and are often designed for a single modality or noise type.

Method: The study proposes a Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model that integrates both noise characteristics and contextual information to effectively denoise images. The approach combines these two pathways and fuses their outputs to enhance performance.

Result: DPL achieves a 3.35% improvement in PSNR compared to the baseline UNet model and demonstrates robustness across multiple imaging modalities and noise types.

Conclusion: The DPL model is a robust and generalizable approach for medical image denoising, outperforming existing methods by effectively leveraging noise and context information across various scenarios.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

### [303] [A Self-training Framework for Semi-supervised Pulmonary Vessel Segmentation and Its Application in COPD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19074)
*Shuiqing Zhao,Meihuan Wang,Jiaxuan Xu,Jie Feng,Wei Qian,Rongchang Chen,Zhenyu Liang,Shouliang Qi,Yanan Wu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a semi-supervised model, Semi2, for segmenting pulmonary vessels in CT scans of COPD patients, improving precision and enabling disease analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation and quantification of pulmonary vessels in COPD patients are essential but challenging, especially for smaller vessels.

Method: The paper proposes a semi-supervised self-training framework utilizing a teacher-student model. It starts with high-quality annotations, pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model, and repeated iterative training of the student model using reliable pseudo-labels.

Result: The Semi2 model achieved a precision of 90.3% in segmenting pulmonary vessels, significantly improving precision by 2.3%. It also offers insights into pulmonary vessel changes across different COPD severity levels.

Conclusion: The method enhances segmentation performance and provides a tool for COPD analysis. The code is openly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

*Yuqi Li,Haotian Zhang,Li Li,Dong Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Hierarchical Progressive Context Model (HPCM) for learned image compression that improves long-range and diverse context modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent image compression methods struggle with effective long-range dependency modeling and context usage across coding steps, hindering accurate latent distribution estimation.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical coding schedule for multi-scale context modeling and a progressive context fusion mechanism to incorporate information from previous coding steps.

Result: Experimental results show that HPCM achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, maintaining a balance between compression efficiency and computational complexity.

Conclusion: HPCM is effective for learned image compression, providing improved performance and insights into better utilizing hierarchical and progressive context modeling.

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

### [305] [Enhancing Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Accuracy through Dual Attention Mechanism in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19199)
*Abdul Hannan,Zahid Mahmood,Rizwan Qureshi,Hazrat Ali*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the problem of imbalanced data in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification by integrating global and category attention blocks into a deep learning framework. Using pre-trained networks like MobileNetV3-small, EfficientNet-b0, and DenseNet-169, the proposed method demonstrates competitive results on APTOS and EYEPACS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck caused by imbalanced data distribution in deep learning models for automatic DR classification, which is crucial for aiding ophthalmologists in clinical practice.

Method: The authors propose a deep learning model based on an attention mechanism, integrating global attention block (GAB) and category attention block (CAB). They use MobileNetV3-small, EfficientNet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as backbone architectures, and they evaluate the method on two public datasets, APTOS and EYEPACS.

Result: The DenseNet-169 model achieved the highest accuracy of 83.20% on the APTOS dataset, while EfficientNet-b0 achieved the highest accuracy of 80% on the EYEPACS dataset. The MobileNetV3-small showed efficiency with fewer parameters. Metrics like F1-score (82.0%), precision (82.1%), sensitivity (83.0%), specificity (95.5%), and kappa score (88.2%) demonstrated the model's efficacy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates the impact of imbalanced data and achieves performance comparable to recent works in DR classification, while also highlighting the efficiency of MobileNetV3-small in terms of parameter count.

Abstract: Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist
ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical
component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the
dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models
trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block
(GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus
effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR
classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based
deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely,
MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone
architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available
datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on
the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by
the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80%
accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a
mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded
75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the
F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of
95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work,
the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90
million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than
other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is
at par with recently reported works on DR classification.

### [306] [Joint Holistic and Lesion Controllable Mammogram Synthesis via Gated Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19201)
*Xin Li,Kaixiang Yang,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel deep-learning framework that synthesizes anatomically coherent mammograms and localized lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in mammogram synthesis caused by insufficient data and lack of lesion diversity, this paper aims to develop a method that improves realism, diversity, and lesion feature emphasis.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on latent denoising diffusion with a soft mask embedding for anatomical coherence and a gated conditioning branch for lesion feature emphasis.

Result: GCDM enhances control over lesion areas, improves realism, and diversifies synthesized mammograms, proving effective in experiments.

Conclusion: GCDM is identified as a potential tool for improving mammogram synthesis, supporting clinical applications, and advancing deep-learning methods in cancer screening.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

### [307] [Reconstruct or Generate: Exploring the Spectrum of Generative Modeling for Cardiac MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19186)
*Niklas Bubeck,Yundi Zhang,Suprosanna Shit,Daniel Rueckert,Jiazhen Pan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper examines how generative models, specifically latent diffusion and autoregressive models, perform across reconstruction and generation tasks in cardiac medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging increasingly relies on generative models for tasks like reconstruction (e.g., inpainting, superresolution) and generation (e.g., creating synthetic data). The study aims to understand how these models balance perceptual quality and data fidelity.

Method: A "generative model zoo" is introduced for benchmarking latent diffusion and autoregressive models on tasks including cardiac image inpainting with different masking ratios and unconditional image generation.

Result: Diffusion models excel in perceptual quality for unconditional generation but may hallucinate with high masking ratios, whereas autoregressive models exhibit consistent performance across masking levels but at lower fidelity.

Conclusion: Generative models exhibit trade-offs between perceptual quality and data fidelity, with diffusion models suitable for generation tasks and autoregressive models better at stable reconstructions.

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

*Niels Rocholl,Ewoud Smit,Mathias Prokop,Alessa Hering*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the ULS23 segmentation model for its longitudinal lesion analysis abilities and identifies major flaws, particularly with positional sensitivity and reliance on centered lesions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of temporal consistency in longitudinal lesion analysis, which is crucial for oncological care, and examine if established single-timepoint models can effectively tackle these challenges.

Method: Evaluated the ULS23 segmentation model using a public clinical dataset of baseline and follow-up CT scans. Conducted a controlled experiment by artificially displacing lesion input data to assess model sensitivity.

Result: The study found two key failure modes: degradation of segmentation quality due to inter-scan registration errors and failure of lesion correspondence when lesions were displaced, revealing limitations in single-timepoint models for longitudinal usage.

Conclusion: Longitudinal lesion analysis requires integrated, end-to-end models designed for temporal analysis, as single-purpose segmentations are inadequate for consistent tracking over time.

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

*Kirsten W. H. Maas,Danny Ruijters,Nicola Pezzotti,Anna Vilanova*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NerT-CA, a novel method for accelerated 4D reconstruction of coronary arteries using sparse-view X-ray angiography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving clinical procedures by overcoming challenges in 3D and 4D reconstruction of coronary arteries, such as structural sparsity, poor distinction, sparse views, and motion.

Method: The method combines neural radiance fields with tensorial representations to speed up dynamic reconstructions using sparse-view angiograms. It uses a decomposition of low-rank and sparse components for modeling.

Result: NerT-CA achieves faster training times and improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, enabling reasonable reconstructions from as few as three views.

Conclusion: NerT-CA enhances reconstruction capabilities for coronary arteries, showcasing potential for clinical utility by addressing limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

TL;DR: The paper presents RealisVSR, a video super-resolution model addressing key challenges in the field using innovative techniques and introducing a new 4K benchmark for robust testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from the need to address the limitations of current VSR methods, including inconsistent temporal modeling, insufficient detail recovery under real-world degradations, and lack of proper evaluation on high-resolution datasets.

Method: The authors propose RealisVSR, incorporating three novel components: a Consistency Preserved ControlNet architecture (CPC) for temporal and motion modeling, High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss) for texture enhancement, and the RealisVideo-4K dataset for evaluating ultra-high-resolution VSR.

Result: RealisVSR demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in video super-resolution, especially for 4K resolution tasks, achieving superior texture recovery with significantly reduced training data requirements (5-25% compared to other models).

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses key limitations in VSR technology, paving the way for enhanced modeling of details and temporal dynamics while providing valuable resources like the RealisVideo-4K dataset for future research.

Abstract: Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through
diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in
GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist
in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational
models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world
degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K
super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with
inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a
high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core
innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated
with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and
suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)
combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture
restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing
1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal
guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume
compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,
SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our
superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models depend on high-quality, artifact-free CMR images, but their performance under motion-related artifacts is not well-studied.

Method: The challenge curated a dataset with 320 CMR cine series, evaluated respiratory-motion artifacts, and hosted tasks on automated image quality classification and myocardial segmentation.

Result: 22 algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the tasks, with performance outcomes shared. The study evaluated the impact of motion artifacts on five clinical biomarkers.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the dataset and evaluation results from the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge, aiming to foster research in motion-robust CMR analysis. All datasets and codes are publicly accessible.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in automated
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis. However, the efficacy of these
models is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, artifact-free
images. In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by
respiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such
artifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,
we organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released
a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed
specific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion
artifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality
assessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust
myocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22
algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports
the evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates
the impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers. All

Motivation: The need for accurate tumor segmentation in adaptive radiation therapy motivated the development of SAM2-Aug, addressing limitations of the existing SAM2 model in tumor accuracy.

Method: Two key strategies were proposed: utilizing prior MR images with annotations and enhancing prompt robustness through bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation.

Result: SAM2-Aug demonstrated superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.86 (liver), 0.89 (abdomen), and 0.90 (brain) across diverse tumor types and imaging sequences.

Conclusion: Prior knowledge integration and augmented prompt strategies significantly enhance segmentation accuracy and generalizability, making SAM2-Aug a promising tool for ART.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy
(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor
accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance
SAM2 for ART.
  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR
images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt
robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The
resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver
dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without
retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86
MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and
prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),
0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across
tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in
boundary-sensitive metrics.
  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity
significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug

TL;DR: This paper evaluates stock price predictors using linear regression and random forest models on Dhaka Stock Exchange data, finding random forest more effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze stock price variability and identify influential factors in the Dhaka Stock Exchange, aiding investors in understanding determinants of market liquidity.

Method: Performed linear regression and compared it with random forest on stock market data, using various metrics to analyze performance.

Result: The random forest model outperformed the linear regression model, and the significance of various factors on stock price variability was identified.

Conclusion: Random forest is a better predictive model for analyzing stock market data; time series data fails to generate an effective linear model for prediction.

Abstract: Share market is one of the most important sectors of economic development of
a country. Everyday almost all companies issue their shares and investors buy
and sell shares of these companies. Generally investors want to buy shares of
the companies whose market liquidity is comparatively greater. Market liquidity
depends on the average price of a share. In this paper, a thorough linear
regression analysis has been performed on the stock market data of Dhaka Stock
Exchange. Later, the linear model has been compared with random forest based on
different metrics showing better results for random forest model. However, the
amount of individual significance of different factors on the variability of
stock price has been identified and explained. This paper also shows that the
time series data is not capable of generating a predictive linear model for
analysis.
